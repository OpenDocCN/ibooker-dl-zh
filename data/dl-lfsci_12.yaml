    other branch of science. The same can be said of deep learning: it is one of the
    most exciting, rapidly advancing areas of computer science. The combination of
    the two has the potential to change the world in dramatic, far-reaching ways.
    The effects are already starting to be felt, but those are trivial compared to
    what will likely happen over the next few decades. The union of deep learning
    with biology can do enormous good, but also great harm.'

    etc. This makes sense. Deep learning’s first great successes were in the field
    of computer vision, and years of research have produced sophisticated architectures
    for analyzing image data. Applying those architectures to medical images is obvious
    low-hanging fruit. But not all of the applications are image-based. Any data that
    can be represented in numeric form is a valid input for deep models: electrocardiograms,
    blood chemistry panels, DNA sequences, gene expression profiles, vital signs,

    hanging fruit。但并非所有应用都是基于图像的。任何可以用数字形式表示的数据都是深度模型的有效输入：心电图、血液化学面板、DNA序列、基因表达谱、生命体征等等。
- en: In many cases, the biggest challenge will be creating the datasets, not designing
    the architectures. Training a deep model requires lots of consistent, cleanly
    labeled data. If you want to diagnose cancer from microscope images, you need
    lots of images from patients both with and without cancer, labeled to indicate
    which are which. If you want to diagnose it from gene expression, you need lots
    of labeled gene expression profiles. The same is true for every disease you hope
    to diagnose, for every type of data you hope to diagnose it from.

    will take a long time, and there will be a long transition period. During that
    transition, doctors will often be tempted to trust computer models that perhaps
    shouldn’t be trusted, and to rely on their recommendations more than is justified.
    As a person creating those models, you have a responsibility to consider carefully

    The earliest stages might involve screening tens or hundreds of thousands of compounds

    each assay is tiny. A few hundred of the most promising compounds might be selected
    for the much more expensive preclinical studies involving animals or cultured
    cells. Of those, perhaps 10 or fewer might advance to clinical trials on humans.
    And of those, if we are lucky, one might eventually reach the market as an approved

    the life sciences. We are at a remarkable moment in history when a set of new
    technologies is coming together to change the world. We are all privileged to
    be part of that process.
