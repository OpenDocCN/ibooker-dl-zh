    your new knowledge effectively and ethically. Deep learning is a technology of
    such power that it’s important for practitioners to think about how to use their

    it behooves new practitioners to pause before building sophisticated deep learning
    systems to ask whether the systems they are building are ethically sound. We will

    made heavy investments in deep learning infrastructure. Most of these companies
    were already familiar with machine learning systems, likely from past experiences
    with machine learning such as with ad prediction systems or search engines. As
    a result, shifting to deep learning from older machine learning systems took only
    a small conceptual shift. Also, the success of past machine learning applications
    has made tech management quite open to the argument that deep learning could be
    more widely applied within companies. For these reasons, software companies are
    likely to remain the most prominent users of deep learning for the near future.
