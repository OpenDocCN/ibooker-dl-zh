- en: While there are many directions that those with a technical inclination and
    a passion for data can pursue, few areas can match the fundamental impact of biomedical
    research. The advent of modern medicine has fundamentally changed the nature of
    human existence. Over the last 20 years, we have seen innovations that have transformed
    the lives of countless individuals. When it first appeared in 1981, HIV/AIDS was
    a largely fatal disease. Continued development of antiretroviral therapies has
    dramatically extended the life expectancy for patients in the developed world.
     Other diseases, such as hepatitis C, which was considered largely untreatable
    a decade ago, can now be cured. Advances in genetics are enabling the identification
    and, hopefully soon, the treatment of a wide array of diseases. Innovations in
    diagnostics and instrumentation have enabled physicians to specifically identify
    and target disease in the human body. Many of these breakthroughs have benefited
    from and will continue to be advanced by computational methods.

- en: Up to now, we have discussed deep learning models as “black boxes.” We present
    the model with a set of input data and the model generates a prediction, with
    no explanation of how or why the prediction was generated. This type of prediction
    can be less than optimal in many situations. If we have a deep learning model
    for medical diagnosis, we often need to understand the reasoning behind the diagnosis.
    An explanation of the reasons for the diagnosis will provide a physician with
    more confidence in the prediction and may also influence treatment decisions.
    One historic drawback to deep learning has been the fact that the models, while
    often reliable, can be difficult to interpret. A number of techniques are currently
    being developed to enable users to better understand the factors that led to a
    prediction. [Chapter 10](ch10.xhtml#interpretation_of_deep_models) provides an
    overview of some of these techniques used to enable human understanding of model
    predictions. Another important aspect of predictive models is the accuracy of
    a model’s predictions. An understanding of a model’s accuracy can help us determine
    how much to rely on that model. Given that machine learning can be used to potentially
    make life-saving diagnoses, an understanding of model accuracy is critical. The

    to eventually generate drugs. Screening can be carried out experimentally, where
    millions of molecules are tested in miniaturized biological tests known as assays,
    or in a computer using virtual screening. In virtual screening, a set of known
    drugs or other biologically active molecules is used to train a machine learning
