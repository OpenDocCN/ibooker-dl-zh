  zh: 11.1 关键概念概述
- en: Transfer learning aims to leverage prior knowledge from different settings—be
    it a different task, language, or domain—to help solve a problem at hand. It is
    inspired by the way in which humans learn, because we typically do not learn things
    from scratch for any given problem, but rather build on prior knowledge that may
    be related. Allowing a practitioner without substantial computing resources to
    achieve state-of-the-art performance is considered an important step toward democratizing
    access to the fruits of the ongoing technological revolution. As a more concrete
    motivation, consider the representative costs of training various sizes of the
    BERT model, as shown in figure 11.1.[¹](#pgfId-1247306)

    BERT 模型的代表性成本，如图 11.1 所示。[¹](#pgfId-1247306)

- en: Transfer learning was popularized in computer vision before it recently came
    to be used heavily by the natural language processing (NLP) community. Whereas
    computer vision deals with teaching computers how to understand and act on images
    and videos, NLP considers how to do the same with human speech, be it text or
    speech audio. In this book, we focused on text. Some NLP tasks of particular interest
    to us include document classification, machine translation, and question answering.

- en: Although historically such tasks were initially solved by attempting to specify
    fixed rules for every scenario—a paradigm now known as symbolic AI—machine learning
    has now become the dominant trend. Instead of explicitly programming a computer
    for every possible scenario, the computer is *trained* to associate input to output
    signals by seeing many examples of such corresponding input-output pairs. The
    methods used to *learn* appropriate input-output associations have traditionally
    included decision trees, random forests, kernel methods such as SVM, and neural
    networks. Neural networks have recently become the clear favorite for learning
    such representations for perceptual problems, that is, computer vision and NLP.
    As such, this is the most important class of methods we explored in this book.

    word2vec by incorporating global information into the embeddings. It optimizes
    the embeddings such that the cosine product between words reflects the number
    of times they co-occur, with the goal of making the resulting vectors more interpretable.
    The fastText technique attempts to enhance word2vec by repeating the Skip-Gram
    methods on character n-grams (versus word n-grams), thereby able to handle previously
    unseen words. Each of these variants of pretrained embeddings has its strengths
    and weaknesses. As a numerical demonstration of this class of methods, we used
    fastText word embeddings to revisit the IMDB movie classification example, where
    the bag-of-words method was replaced with fastText for converting the text into

- en: Advances in sequence-to-sequence modeling brought forth a revolution for tasks
    such as machine translation. The encoder and decoder in this setup were initially
    recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Due to problems with long input sequences, the
    technique known as attention was developed to allow output to focus only on relevant
    sections of the input. Although initially this was combined with RNNs, it evolved
    into the technique of self-attention being used to build out both the encoder
    and decoder. Self-attention differs from the original attention formulation in
    that associations are sought between parts of a sequence and other parts of the
    same sequence, rather than between parts of two distinct input and output sequences.
    The architecture in which self-attention replaced attention came to be known as
    *the transformer*, and it scales better than earlier RNN-based sequence-to-sequence
    models on parallel computing architecture. This improved scalability drove its
    wide adoption over the competing architectures. We used a pretrained translation
    transformer model between English and the Ghanaian language Twi to probe the efficacy

    given sentence is a plausible following sentence after a target sentence. Although
    not suited for text generation, this model performs very well on other general

    splitting up of a larger matrix of weights into two smaller matrices, allowing
    you to increase the dimensions of one without affecting the dimensions of the
    other. The second idea involves sharing parameters across all layers. These two
    strategies are the bedrock of the method known as ALBERT (A Lite BERT). We used

    Lite BERT）方法的基础。我们使用transformers库中的实现来亲身体验这一方法。
- en: Consequently, we built on the idea of multitask learning, where a model is trained
    to perform a variety of tasks at once and yields a more generalizable model. When
    faced with a transfer scenario where we have insufficient training data to fine-tune
    on a given task, why not fine-tune on multiple tasks? Discussing this idea provided
    a great opportunity to introduce the *General Language Understanding Evaluation*
    (GLUE) dataset, a collection of data for several tasks representative of human
    language reasoning, such as detecting similarity between sentences, similarity
    between questions, paraphrasing, sentiment analysis, and question answering. We
    showed how to quickly leverage the transformers library for multitask fine-tuning
    using this dataset. This exercise also demonstrated how to similarly fine-tune
    a model from the BERT family on a custom dataset from one of these important classes

  zh: 因此，我们基于多任务学习的想法，即模型被训练以同时执行多种任务，并产生更具有普遍性的模型。当面临转移场景时，我们没有足够的训练数据来在给定任务上进行微调时，为什么不在多个任务上进行微调？讨论这个想法给我们提供了一个很好的机会来介绍*通用语言理解评估*（GLUE）数据集，这是一组代表人类语言推理的几项任务的数据集，例如检测句子之间的相似性，问题之间的相似性，释义，情感分析和问题回答。我们展示了如何使用这个数据集快速利用transformers库进行多任务微调。这个练习还演示了如何类似地在来自这些重要问题类别之一的自定义数据集上微调来自BERT系列的模型。
- en: We also built on the idea of domain adaptation, particularly the fact that the
    similarity of the source and target domains plays a crucial role in the effectiveness
    of transfer learning. Greater similarity implies an easier transfer learning process
    in general. When the source and target are too dissimilar, it may be impossible
    to carry out the process in a single step. In those circumstances, the idea of
    *sequential adaptation* may be used to break the overall desired transfer into
    simpler, more manageable steps. By way of example, we sequentially adapted a “fill-in-the-blanks”
    objective pretrained BERT to a low-resource sentence similarity-detection scenario,
    by first adapting to a data-rich question-similarity scenario. Data for both scenarios
    in the experiment came from the GLUE dataset.

  zh: 我们还建立在领域自适应的思想上，特别是源域和目标域的相似性对于迁移学习的有效性起着至关重要的作用。更大的相似性通常意味着一般情况下更容易进行迁移学习。当源域和目标域之间相差太大时，可能无法在单一步骤中执行该过程。在这种情况下，可能会使用*顺序自适应*的想法将所需的整体迁移分解为更简单、更易管理的步骤。举例来说，我们首先将一个“填空”目标预训练的
    BERT 逐步适应到一个低资源的句子相似度检测场景中，再适应到一个数据丰富的问题相似度场景中。实验中两个场景的数据都来自 GLUE 数据集。
- en: The final adaptation strategy we explored was the use of so-called *adaptation
    modules* or *adapters*. These are newly introduced modules of only a few parameters
    between layers of a pretrained neural network. Fine-tuning this modified model
    for new tasks requires training only these few additional parameters. The weights
    of the original network are kept the same. Virtually no loss in performance, compared
    to fine-tuning the entire model, is often observed when adding just 3-4% additional
    parameters per task. These adapters are also modular and easily shared between
    researchers. We used the AdapterHub framework to load some of these adapters and

    have played an important role in NLP. First appearing in the context of recurrent
    neural network (RNN) models, they were also explored notably by the translation
    application area in the context of the original transformer architecture. T5,
    the “Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer,”[^(18)](#pgfId-1247518) is an attempt
    to cast a broad range of NLP problems into a unifying sequence-to-sequence framework.
    It allows for the application of the same model, objective, training procedure,
    and decoding process for every task. Handled problem classes vary from summarization
    to sentiment analysis and question answering, among many others. Translation for
    the language pairs between English and each of Romanian, German, and French is
    included in training. Some representative data transformations, which make it
    possible to train a single model on diverse tasks, are shown in figure 11.3 for

    task descriptor to the original text data. Training data included the datasets

    tasks without modifying the model. In that sense, it can be thought of as an interesting
    variant or iteration of the multitask learning idea that we have been bringing
    up throughout the book. The inclusion of such a variety of tasks for simultaneous
    learning is likely to enable parameter sharing and better generalizability of
    the resulting model. Crucially, the model is initially trained on a dataset the
    authors call the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4) using a masked language modeling
    or autoencoding objective, before fine-tuning on the aforementioned variety of
    tasks. Basically, 15% of all tokens are dropped, and the result is fed to the
    input, while the uncorrupted input is fed to the output for prediction. Note that
    the C4 corpus is essentially the internet for the target language (English) with
    pornographic material, code, and other “garbage data” filtered out. The model
    architecture used for training is similar to the transformer architecture we used

- en: Early high-profile machine learning studies of bias predictably happened in
    computer vision. The landmark work, “Gender Shades,”[^(34)](#pgfId-1247623) studied
    the accuracy of commercial gender-classification systems along racial and gender
    dimensions. It found that these systems underperformed for dark-skinned women
    as compared to lighter-skinned males by up to 35 absolute percentage points. This
    has an immense practical impact on minority communities, which may be policed
    by some of these automatic computer vision systems in some regions. An incorrect
    classification or detection can mean wrongful arrest, which even if cleared can
    mean job loss in the most vulnerable communities. There have been multiple widespread
    reports of this happening to real people. A cynical power imbalance was uncovered
    behind systems parading as “objective” and “scientific,” where the richer communities
    where these systems were developed and their economic benefits were mostly reaped
    did not suffer the harm inflicted on the poorer communities. The impact of this
    work and related studies was significant, with the US Congress recently taking
    up related mitigating regulation arguably as a direct consequence. Companies such
    as IBM and Amazon have also been forced to review how they share these technologies
    with law enforcement authorities, with IBM completely discontinuing the service.

- en: Concerns about bias of pretrained NLP language models has also been high recently.
    In fact, the GPT-3 paper[^(35)](#pgfId-1247627) includes a dedicated section for
    a study along several dimensions, namely race, sex, and religion. It has become
    more and more common to see academic articles do this recently, which is quite
    encouraging to see. The GPT-3 study in particular probes the association the model
    learned from the training data for the various dimensions of interest. For instance,
    they discovered that occupations usually associated with a higher level of education
    were more closely associated with male pronouns when filling in the blanks. Similarly,
    prompts implying professional competence were more likely to be completed by male
    pronouns and specifiers. This is likely gender bias directly learned by the model
    from the internet, which we probably can’t expect to be an unbiased source. On
    the other hand, positive descriptors were assigned to nouns primed with “Asian”
    and “White” at a significantly higher rate than for “Black” personas. Again, a
    racial bias was clearly learned by the model from the internet, and blind application
    of the model would simply propagate this bias. On the religious dimension, the
    word “Islam” was associated with the word “terrorism” among the most likely completions.
    As a direct real-world impact of this bias, consider the case of the Palestinian
    man whose benign “good morning” Facebook post was incorrectly translated as “attack
    them” and led to significant unfair consequences.[^(36)](#pgfId-1247630)

  zh: 最近对预训练的自然语言处理语言模型存在偏见的担忧也很高。实际上，GPT-3论文[^(35)](#pgfId-1247627)专门包括了一个研究的部分，涵盖了几个方面，即种族、性别和宗教。最近越来越常见地看到学术文章做这样的研究，这是非常令人鼓舞的。特别是GPT-3的研究探讨了模型从训练数据中学到的与各个关注维度的关联。例如，他们发现通常与较高教育水平相关联的职业在填空时更倾向于与男性代词相关联。同样，暗示专业能力的提示更有可能由男性代词和说明者完成。这很可能是模型直接从互联网学到的性别偏见，我们可能无法指望互联网是一个无偏见的信息来源。另一方面，积极的描述词更有可能被“亚洲”和“白人”等词引导的名词以比“黑人”人物高得多的速度分配。同样，模型显然从互联网学到了种族偏见，而对模型的盲目应用只会传播这种偏见。在宗教维度上，“伊斯兰”一词与“恐怖主义”一词相关联，是最有可能的完成之一。作为这种偏见的直接现实影响，考虑一下那位巴勒斯坦人的善意“早上好”Facebook帖子被错误地翻译为“攻击他们”，并导致了重大的不公平后果。[^(36)](#pgfId-1247630)
- en: Another way pretrained NLP language models could inadvertently affect poor communities
    is via climate change. In fact, these models have recently been shown to have
    quite the carbon footprint.[^(37)](#pgfId-1247634), [^(38)](#pgfId-1247637) Although
    the carbon footprint of training a single BERT model once was found to be equivalent
    to a single average roundtrip flight between New York and San Francisco, during
    fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization, the model is actually trained many
    times. If the model was to be deployed via *neural architecture search*, where
    various architecture hyperparameters are exhaustively varied and the best-performing
    model selected, the researchers found a single model deployment to cost the footprint
    of up to five average cars over their entire lifetime. Again, this is serious
    and particularly egregious, because the effects of climate change, directly linked
    to these carbon footprints, hit hardest in the poorest communities, which do not
    experience the direct benefits of these models. It is clear that these costs need
    to be taken into account when evaluating these models. This realization is arguably
    one of the forces driving the field toward more parameter-efficient models.

    [^(38)](#pgfId-1247637)虽然发现单个 BERT 模型的一次训练的碳足迹相当于纽约到旧金山的一个普通往返航班，但在微调和超参数优化期间，模型实际上会进行多次训练。如果模型通过
    *神经架构搜索* 部署，其中各种架构超参数被详尽地变化，然后选择性能最佳的模型，研究人员发现单个模型部署的碳足迹相当于五辆普通汽车的寿命。再次强调，这是严重的，特别是因为与这些碳足迹直接相关的气候变化影响最严重的是贫困社区，而这些社区并没有体验到这些模型的直接好处。很明显，在评估这些模型时，这些成本需要纳入考虑。这一认识可以说是驱使该领域朝着更具参数效率的模型发展的力量之一。
- en: 'A lingering criticism of pretrained language models, and deep learning in general,
    is that the models tend to be not very *explainable*—it is hard to explain how
    a model arrived at its predictions for any particular scenario. This is related
    to the earlier bias discussion we had in this section—having the model explain
    how it arrived at associations related to education, for instance, could help
    detect if such a decision was made based on the race or sex variable. Most notable
    recent approaches at achieving this, such as bertviz,[^(39)](#pgfId-1247642) try
    to build on the attention visualization we explored in chapter 7\. This still
    does not address the lack of training data transparency question that remains:
    the training of language models takes place at such a large data scale that it
    is virtually impossible for researchers to ensure that it is unbiased. Therefore,
    we expect to see an investment of time and effort into the development of methods
    that could perform comparably from significantly smaller, well-curated datasets.'

  zh: 预训练语言模型及深度学习普遍存在的一个长期批评是，这些模型往往不太*可解释*——很难解释模型是如何在特定情景下得出预测的。这与本节早些时候讨论的偏见问题有关——让模型解释其对教育相关联的决策是如何做出的，例如，可以帮助检测这样的决定是否基于种族或性别变量。最值得注意的最近的方法之一是
    bertviz，[^(39)](#pgfId-1247642)试图在第7章中探索的注意力可视化基础上进行改进。然而，这仍然没有解决训练数据透明度缺失的问题：语言模型的训练规模如此之大，以至于研究人员几乎无法确保其是无偏的。因此，我们期望看到人们投入时间和精力开发出可以从更小、精心策划的数据集中执行相当的方法。
