- en: You must be confident by now in building and evaluating a core RAG pipeline.
    Applications such as “chat with your PDF” or question-answering systems based
    on web pages should no longer be a mystery. This part of the book will guide you
    in improving your RAG pipeline and also lay out a blueprint for the layers required
    to build a production-ready RAG system.

  zh: 到现在为止，你应该在构建和评估核心RAG管道方面充满信心。例如，“与你的PDF聊天”或基于网页的问答系统等应用不应再是谜团。本书的这一部分将指导你改进你的RAG管道，并概述构建生产就绪RAG系统所需的层蓝图。
- en: In chapter 6, you’ll be able to try out different techniques for improving the
    basic RAG pipeline into a more advanced one. You’ll get to know the techniques
    that improve RAG in three different stages—before, during, and after retrieval.
    You’ll also learn about modularity and how modern RAG systems are made up of replaceable
    components.

  zh: 在第6章中，你将能够尝试不同的技术，将基本的RAG管道改进为一个更高级的版本。你将了解在检索前、中、后三个阶段提高RAG的技术。你还将了解模块化以及现代RAG系统由可替换组件组成。
- en: Chapter 7 discusses the operations stack for RAG. You will learn about the critical
    layers without which any RAG system will fail, the essential layers that improve
    system performance, and the enhancement layers that focus on usability, scalability,
    and efficiency of the system.
