    to solve for shoppers. Were shoppers really that annoyed about checkouts that
    they’d flock to Amazon Go shops just to avoid it? … If it was about reducing the
    cost of operating a supermarket and thus offer better deals, it was also unclear
    how the technology would accomplish that, as supermarkets with the Just Walk Out

    to use AI as an assistant to help you perform a task. We focus on conversational

  zh: 有没有优化这段代码的方法？
- en: Other tasks are much more difficult to describe as they require a detailed,
    step-by-step specification of the solution. In these cases, writing the prompt
    might be as cumbersome as writing the code itself. For example, I once had to
    use a library called GraphHopper, which contains algorithms to find the shortest
    route between landmarks in a map, but I had to customize it to measure distances
    in a nonstandard way. For that, we had to use a custom formula we had designed
    together with the client. The requirements were so specific and custom, that I’m
    not sure I would have saved any time by writing a prompt and having an LLM write
    the code. So, if your answer to the question “Can I describe the task succinctly?”
    is yes, there are higher chances that AI will help you solve the problem (see
    table 4.2 at the end of this section). As AI hallucinates sometimes, it’s also
    important that you ask yourself the second question, “Can I validate the output
    easily?”, especially if you’re sensitive about the correctness of the output (see
    section 4.1.2).
  id: totrans-59
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 其他任务描述起来要困难得多，因为它们需要详细、分步地指定解决方案。在这些情况下，编写提示可能和编写代码本身一样繁琐。例如，我曾经不得不使用一个名为GraphHopper的库，它包含在地图上地标之间找到最短路径的算法，但我必须将其定制以以非标准方式测量距离。为此，我们必须使用我们与客户共同设计的自定义公式。要求如此具体和定制，以至于我不确定通过编写提示并让LLM编写代码我是否节省了任何时间。所以，如果你的答案是“我能否简洁地描述任务？”是肯定的，那么AI帮助你解决问题的可能性就更高（参见本节末尾的表4.2）。由于AI有时会胡编乱造，因此你也要问问自己第二个问题，“我能否轻松验证输出？”，尤其是如果你对输出的正确性非常敏感（参见4.1.2节）。
- en: Some tasks can be validated easily. For example, if you already know how to
    perform the task, and all you want is to save time, you can rely on your expertise
    to quickly validate AI’s output. For example, I often forget how to use the Boto3
    library to read files from S3\. So, I often ask ChatGPT how to do it. Because
    I’ve already done it before and it just involves a couple of lines of code, I
    can easily look at ChatGPT’s code and verify that it’s correct. I can also quickly
    run the code to see if it fetches the required S3 file correctly.
  id: totrans-60
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 一些任务可以轻松验证。例如，如果你已经知道如何执行这个任务，而你只想节省时间，你可以依赖你的专业知识来快速验证AI的输出。例如，我经常忘记如何使用Boto3库从S3读取文件。所以，我经常询问ChatGPT如何操作。因为我之前已经做过，而且只需要几行代码，我可以很容易地查看ChatGPT的代码并验证其正确性。我也可以快速运行代码，看看它是否正确地获取了所需的S3文件。
- en: To cite another example, if you ask an LLM whether a piece of code can be optimized,
    you can easily check whether its recommendations make sense to you, especially
    if you have coding experience and have studied things such as computational complexity.
    Or if you ask ChatGPT to rewrite a piece of code in another programming language,
    you can also verify the output if you’re familiar with the target language.
  id: totrans-61
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 以另一个例子来说，如果你询问一个LLM一段代码是否可以优化，你可以轻松检查其建议是否对你有意义，尤其是如果你有编码经验并研究过诸如计算复杂性等内容。或者如果你让ChatGPT将一段代码重写为另一种编程语言，如果你熟悉目标语言，你也可以验证输出。
- en: In other cases, validating AI’s output is not as quick or easy. For example,
    suppose you ask ChatGPT to write a SQL query that requires plenty of joins and
    business logic. Understanding the resulting query step by step may be cumbersome
    and take as much time as writing the query yourself. Or, if you ask ChatGPT to
    write code in a language you don’t know, you might have a hard time debugging
    it.
  id: totrans-62

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在其他情况下，验证AI的输出并不像想象中那样快捷或容易。例如，假设你要求ChatGPT编写一个需要大量连接和业务逻辑的SQL查询。逐步理解生成的查询可能很繁琐，可能需要花费与编写查询一样多的时间。或者，如果你要求ChatGPT用你不懂的语言编写代码，你可能会在调试它时遇到困难。

    also yes, then AI may provide good assistance.

  zh: 用户是否会用自然语言与我产品互动？
- en: I know a startup that was building a travel-planning app. The user would input
    travel details in a structured format by selecting the dates on a calendar and
    the destination from a list. The tool would then produce a structured sightseeing
    itinerary displayed in a timeline and a map. Note that this wasn’t a chatbot—the
    user didn’t converse with the app at any point by writing or reading free-form
    text.

  zh: 我知道有一个初创公司正在开发一个旅行规划应用。用户会通过在日历上选择日期和从列表中选择目的地，以结构化格式输入旅行详情。然后，该工具会生成一个结构化的观光行程，以时间线和地图的形式显示。请注意，这并不是一个聊天机器人——用户在任何时候都没有通过书写或阅读自由文本与该应用进行对话。
- en: Due to the popularization of LLMs, the company decided to build this feature
    using an LLM under the hood. The user’s request was first transformed into a natural-language
    prompt, such as, “Create a day-by-day itinerary to visit Paris from July 1st to
    July 7th…” The overall prompt was lengthy, as it contained instructions on how
    to output the itinerary in a specific format so it could be easily parsed and
    rendered in the app.

  zh: 由于LLM的普及，公司决定在底层使用LLM构建这个功能。用户的请求首先被转换成自然语言提示，例如，“从7月1日到7月7日制定每天的巴黎行程……”整体提示很长，因为它包含了如何以特定格式输出行程的说明，以便在应用中轻松解析和渲染。
- en: The startup struggled to make this work. One of the reasons was that the LLM’s
    output often included outdated information, such as a suggestion to visit an attraction
    that didn’t exist anymore or at a time during which it was closed. Moreover, the
    LLM’s output sometimes didn’t fully respect the required structure. For example,
    it would sometimes indicate an attraction’s street address where its web address
    should be. In addition, it all took over a minute to run, which is too long by
    today’s browsing standards.

  zh: 那家初创公司努力使这个功能工作。其中一个原因是LLM的输出经常包含过时的信息，例如建议访问一个已经不存在或在该时间段内关闭的景点。此外，LLM的输出有时并不完全遵守所需的结构。例如，它有时会在应该提供网址的地方指示景点的街道地址。此外，整个过程需要超过一分钟才能运行，这在今天的浏览标准下太长了。
- en: The startup then realized that the problem it was trying to solve wasn’t related
    to natural language in any way—the user didn’t type in the inputs as free-form
    text (“I’d like to visit Paris”) and the outputs weren’t shown to the user as
    text either. So why use LLMs at all?

  zh: 那家初创公司随后意识到，它试图解决的问题与自然语言没有任何关系——用户并没有以自由文本形式输入（“我想去巴黎”）输入，输出也没有以文本形式展示给用户。那么为什么还要使用LLM呢？
- en: 'The startup ended up solving the problem differently: after the user made a
    query, the software searched for relevant attractions in the required destination
    using the Google Places API, which provides up-to-date and structured information
    about attractions, such as opening hours and coordinates. Afterward, the software
    ran a pathfinding algorithm to create an ideal sightseeing itinerary from those
    attractions. The solution ran much faster and solved the problem better.'

  zh: 那家初创公司最终以不同的方式解决了这个问题：在用户提出查询后，软件使用Google Places API在所需目的地搜索相关景点，该API提供有关景点最新和结构化信息，例如营业时间和坐标。之后，软件运行路径查找算法，从这些景点创建一个理想的观光行程。该解决方案运行得更快，并且更好地解决了问题。
- en: If users will interact with your product through natural language, using an
    LLM might be the best choice (see table 4.3 at the end of this section), as LLMs
    are specially designed to process and produce natural language. For example, if
    you’re building a customer-service chatbot, then using LLMs may be the best choice
    because they’re designed to process written, free-form requests and generate convincing
    prose. In this case, you exploit what LLMs are best at.

  zh: 如果用户将通过自然语言与您的产品进行交互，使用大型语言模型（LLM）可能是最佳选择（参见本节末尾的表4.3），因为LLM专门设计用于处理和生成自然语言。例如，如果您正在构建一个客服聊天机器人，那么使用LLM可能是最佳选择，因为它们被设计来处理书面形式的自由文本请求并生成令人信服的散文。在这种情况下，您利用了LLM最擅长的能力。
- en: When users will not interact with your product using natural language, such
    as in the travel app, you may want to think twice before using an LLM to solve
    it. If you use an LLM, you may not enjoy its benefits, and you’ll have to cope
    with its drawbacks, such as long execution time, hallucinations, and unstructured
    outputs. In those cases, old-school software, such as a database look up, may
    do a better job. So, if your task does not involve natural language, analyze first
    whether other tools could be more suitable for the job before building an LLM
    wrapper.

  zh: 当用户不会使用自然语言与您的产品进行交互时，例如在旅行应用中，在使用LLM解决问题之前，您可能需要三思。如果您使用LLM，您可能不会享受到它的好处，并且您将不得不应对其缺点，如长执行时间、幻觉和不规则输出。在这些情况下，传统的软件，如数据库查找，可能做得更好。因此，如果您的任务不涉及自然语言，在构建LLM包装器之前，首先分析是否有其他工具更适合这项工作。

    the task and validate the output?” If so, you get good bang for your prompt, which
