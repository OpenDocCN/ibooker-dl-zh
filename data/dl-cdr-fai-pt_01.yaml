  zh: 序言
- en: In a very short time, deep learning has become a widely useful technique, solving
    and automating problems in computer vision, robotics, healthcare, physics, biology,
    and beyond. One of the delightful things about deep learning is its relative simplicity.
    Powerful deep learning software has been built to make getting started fast and
    easy. In a few weeks, you can understand the basics and get comfortable with the
    techniques.

  zh: 在很短的时间内，深度学习已经成为一种广泛应用的技术，解决和自动化计算机视觉、机器人技术、医疗保健、物理学、生物学等领域的问题。深度学习的一大乐趣在于其相对简单性。强大的深度学习软件已经构建起来，使得快速入门变得快速简单。在几周内，你就可以理解基础知识并熟悉技术。
- en: This opens up a world of creativity. You start applying it to problems that
    have data at hand, and you feel wonderful seeing a machine solving problems for
    you. However, you slowly feel yourself getting closer to a giant barrier. You
    built a deep learning model, but it doesn’t work as well as you had hoped. This
    is when you enter the next stage, finding and reading state-of-the-art research
    on deep learning.

  zh: 这打开了一个创造性的世界。你开始将其应用于手头的数据问题，并且看到机器为你解决问题时感到很棒。然而，你慢慢感到自己越来越接近一个巨大的障碍。你构建了一个深度学习模型，但它的效果并不如你希望的那样好。这时你进入下一个阶段，寻找并阅读关于深度学习的最新研究。
- en: However, there’s a voluminous body of knowledge on deep learning, with three
    decades of theory, techniques, and tooling behind it. As you read through some
    of this research, you realize that humans can explain simple things in really
    complicated ways. Scientists use words and mathematical notation in these papers
    that appear foreign, and no textbook or blog post seems to cover the necessary
    background that you need in accessible ways. Engineers and programmers assume
    you know how GPUs work and have knowledge about obscure tools.

  zh: 然而，关于深度学习有大量的知识，有三十年的理论、技术和工具支持。当你阅读一些研究时，你会意识到人类可以用非常复杂的方式解释简单的事情。科学家在这些论文中使用的词语和数学符号看起来很陌生，没有任何教科书或博客文章似乎涵盖了你需要的背景知识。工程师和程序员假设你知道GPU如何工作，并且了解一些晦涩的工具。
- en: This is when you wish you had a mentor or a friend that you could talk to. Someone
    who was in your shoes before, who knows the tooling and the math—someone who could
    guide you through the best research, state-of-the-art techniques, and advanced
    engineering, and make it comically simple. I was in your shoes a decade ago, when
    I was breaking into the field of machine learning. For years, I struggled to understand
    papers that had a little bit of math in them. I had good mentors around me, which
    helped me greatly, but it took me many years to get comfortable with machine learning
    and deep learning. That motivated me to coauthor PyTorch, a software framework
    to make deep learning accessible.

  zh: 这时候你会希望有一个导师或者一个可以交流的朋友。一个曾经身临其境、了解工具和数学的人——一个可以指导你掌握最佳研究、最先进技术和高级工程，并使其变得滑稽简单的人。十年前，我曾经身临其境，当时我正在进入机器学习领域。多年来，我努力理解那些含有一点数学的论文。我周围有很好的导师，这对我帮助很大，但我花了很多年才对机器学习和深度学习感到舒适。这激励我成为PyTorch的合著者，这是一个使深度学习变得易于接触的软件框架。
- en: Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger were also in your shoes. They wanted to learn
    and apply deep learning, without any previous formal training as ML scientists
    or engineers. Like me, Jeremy and Sylvain learned gradually over the years and
    eventually became experts and leaders. But unlike me, Jeremy and Sylvain selflessly
    put a huge amount of energy into making sure others don’t have to take the painful
    path that they took. They built a great course called fast.ai that makes cutting-edge
    deep learning techniques accessible to people who know basic programming. It has
    graduated hundreds of thousands of eager learners who have become great practitioners.

  zh: Jeremy Howard和Sylvain Gugger也曾身临其境。他们想学习和应用深度学习，但没有任何以前的机器学习科学家或工程师的正式培训。像我一样，Jeremy和Sylvain在多年的学习中逐渐成为专家和领导者。但与我不同的是，Jeremy和Sylvain无私地投入了大量精力，确保其他人不必像他们走过的痛苦之路。他们建立了一个名为fast.ai的优秀课程，使了解前沿深度学习技术的人们能够掌握基本编程知识。这个课程已经毕业了成千上万渴望学习的学习者，他们已经成为了优秀的实践者。
- en: In this book, which is another tireless product, Jeremy and Sylvain have constructed
    a magical journey through deep learning. They use simple words and introduce every
    concept. They bring cutting-edge deep learning and state-of-the-art research to
    you, yet make it very accessible.

  zh: 在这本书中，Jeremy和Sylvain构建了一个通过深度学习的神奇之旅。他们用简单的语言介绍每个概念。他们将前沿深度学习和最新研究带给你，同时使其变得非常易于理解。
- en: You are taken through the latest advances in computer vision, dive into natural
    language processing, and learn some foundational math in a 500-page delightful
    ride. And the ride doesn’t stop at fun, as they take you through shipping your
    ideas to production. You can treat the fast.ai community, thousands of practitioners
    online, as your extended family, where individuals like you are available to talk
    and ideate small and big solutions, whatever the problem may be.

  zh: 你将通过最新的计算机视觉进展，深入自然语言处理，并在500页的愉快旅程中学习一些基础数学。而这个旅程并不仅仅停留在有趣，因为他们还会带你将你的想法投入生产。你可以将fast.ai社区视为你的扩展家庭，成千上万的从业者在线上，像你一样的个人可以交流和构思大小解决方案，无论问题是什么。
- en: I am very glad you’ve found this book, and I hope it inspires you to put deep
    learning to good use, regardless of the nature of the problem.
