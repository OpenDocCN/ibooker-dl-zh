- en: The year is 1450\. A sleepy corner of Mainz, Germany, unknowingly stands on
    the precipice of a monumental era. In Humbrechthof, a nondescript workshop shrouded
    in the town's shadows pulsates with anticipation. It is here that Johannes Gutenberg,
    a goldsmith and innovator, sweats and labors amidst the scents of oil, metal,
    and determination, silently birthing a revolution. In the late hours of the night,
    the peace is broken intermittently by the rhythmic hammering of metal on metal.
    In the lamp-lit heart of the workshop stands Gutenberg's decade-long labor of
    love—a contraption unparalleled in design and purpose.

  zh: 现在是1450年。德国美因茨的一个寂静角落，在不知不觉中站在一个伟大时代的边缘。在Humbrechthof，这个隐藏在城镇阴影中的不起眼作坊里，空气中充满着油、金属和坚定决心的气味，约翰内斯·古腾堡，一位金匠和创新者，在这里辛苦劳作，无声地孕育着一场革命。在深夜的时刻，平静被金属与金属的节奏性敲打声不时打破。在作坊灯光明亮的中心，站立着古腾堡十年来的心血之作——一台设计和用途都独一无二的装置。
- en: This is no ordinary invention. Craftsmanship and creativity transform an assortment
    of moveable metal types, individually-cast characters born painstakingly into
    a matrix. The flickering light dances off the metallic insignias. The air pulsates
    with the anticipation of a breakthrough and the heady sweetness of oil-based ink,
    an innovation from Gutenberg himself. In the stillness of the moment, the master
    printer squares his shoulders and with unparalleled finesse, lays down a crisp
    sheet of parchment beneath the ink-loaded matrix and allows his invention to press
    firmly and stamp finely print onto the page. The room adjusts to the symphony
    of silence, bated breaths hanging heavily in the air. As the press is lifted,
    it creaks under its own weight, each screech akin to a war cry announcing an exciting
    new world.

    and slams it flat onto the wooden table carefully examining each character which

    As the night gives way to day, he looks upon his workshop with invigorated pride.
    His legacy is born, echoing in the annals of history and forever changing the
    way information would take wings. Johannes Gutenberg, now the man of the millennium,
    emerges from the shadows, an inventor who dared to dream. His name synonymous

    theory of mind tests. They’ve passed both Google and Amazon coding interviews.
    They’ve gotten scores of at least 1410 out of 1600 on the SAT. One of the most
    impressive to the authors is that GPT-4 has even passed the Advanced Sommelier

- en: Passing tests is fun and all, but not exactly all that helpful unless our aim
    was to build the most expensive cheating machine ever, which we promise there’s
    better use of our time. What LLMs are good at is language, particularly, helping
    us improve and automate communication. This allows us to transform common bitter
    experiences into easy enjoyable experiences. For starters, imagine entering your
    home where you have your very own personal JARVIS, as if stepping into the shoes
    of Iron Man, an AI-powered assistant that adds an unparalleled dynamic to your
    routine. While not quite to the same artificial general intelligence (AGI) levels
    as those portrayed by JARVIS in the Marvel movies, LLMs are powering new user
    experiences from improving customer support to helping you shop for a loved one’s
    birthday. It knows to ask you about the person, learn about their interests and
    who they are, find out your budget, and then make specialized recommendations.
    While many of these assistants are being put to good work, many others are simply
    just chatbots that users can talk to and entertain themselves—which is important
    because even our imaginary friends are too busy these days. Jokes aside, these

    they are still dreadful at this. Just a personal preference, but we wouldn’t try
    to save a buck when our sanity is on the line. Of course, this leads us to the
    fact that people are already using them for darker purposes like cheating, scams,
    and fake news to skew elections. At this point, the list has become rather large

- en: Or better yet, “What shouldn’t they do?” Well, as a technology there are certain
    restrictions and constraints, for example, LLMs are kind of slow. Of course, slow
    is a relative term, but responsive times are often measured in seconds not milliseconds.
    We’ll dive deeper into this in Chapter 3, but as an example, we probably won’t
    see them being used in autocomplete tasks anytime soon which require blazingly
    fast inference in order to be useful. After all, autocomplete needs to be able
    to predict the word or phrase faster than someone types. In a similar fashion,
    LLMs are large complex systems, we don’t need them for such a simple problem anyway.
    Hitting an autocomplete problem with an LLM isn’t just hitting the nail with a
    sledgehammer, it’s hitting it with a full on wrecking ball. And just like it’s
    more expensive to rent a wrecking ball than buy a hammer, an LLM will cost you
    more to operate. There are a lot of similar tasks where we should consider the
    complexity of the problem we are trying to solve.

  zh: 或者更好的是，“它们不应该做什么？”嗯，作为一种技术，有一些限制和约束，例如，LLM速度有点慢。当然，慢是一个相对的词，但响应时间通常是以秒为单位而不是毫秒。我们将在第三章中更深入地探讨这个问题，但举个例子，我们可能不会很快看到它们用于自动完成任务，因为那需要非常快的推理才能有用。毕竟，自动完成需要能够比某人的打字速度更快地预测单词或短语。类似地，LLM是大型复杂系统，我们不需要它们来解决这样一个简单的问题。用LLM解决自动完成问题不仅仅是用锤子打钉子，而是用整个拆迁球撞击它。就像租用一颗拆迁球比买一把锤子更贵一样，运行LLM会花费你更多。有很多类似的任务，我们应该考虑解决的问题的复杂性。
- en: There are also many complex problems that are often poorly solved with LLMs
    such as predicting the future. No, we don’t mean with mystic arts, but forecasting
    problems, acts like predicting the weather or when high tide will hit on the ocean
    shore. These are actually problems we’ve solved, but we don’t necessarily have
    good ways to communicate how these have been solved. They are expressed through
    combinations of math solutions like Fourier transforms and harmonic analysis or
    through black box ML models. There are many problems that fit into this category,
    like outlier prediction, calculus, or finding the end of the roll of tape.

- en: You also probably want to avoid using them for highly risky projects. LLMs aren’t
    infallible and make mistakes often. To increase creativity we often allow for
    a bit of randomness in LLMs which means you can ask an LLM the same question and
    get different answers. That’s risky. You can remove this randomness by doing what’s
    called turning down the temperature, but that might make it useless depending
    on your needs. For example, you might decide to use an LLM to categorize investment
    options as good or bad, but do you want it to then make actual investment decisions
    based on its output? Not without oversight, unless your goal is to create a meme

    While an LLM could do these things, it won’t protect you from heavy penalties
    in an IRS audit like hiring a certified CPA would. If you take bad medical advice

    immediately less costly to buy, as the most costly service widely used on the
    market currently is only $20 USD per month. Compared to an EC2 instance on AWS,
    just running that same model for inference (not even training) could run you up
    a bill for about $250k USD per year. This is where building has done its quickest
    innovation, however. If all you need is an LLM for a proof of concept, any of
    the projects mentioned in the Competitive Edge section will allow you to create
    a demo for only the cost of electricity to run on the computer you are demoing
    on, and spell out training easily enough to allow for significantly reduced costs
    to train a model on your own data, as low as $100 (yes, that’s the real number)
    for a model with 20 billion parameters. Another benefit is knowing that if you
    build your own, your cost will never go up, like it very much will when paying
    for a service.

  zh: 当我们解决与语言相关的问题时，我们发现制作原型很容易，而制作一个真正的产品则非常非常困难。语言中有太多微妙之处。许多人想知道为什么ChatGPT如此火爆？仅仅在五天内就获得了超过一百万的客户。我听到的大多数答案都无法满足专家，因为ChatGPT并不比GPT3或其他已经存在几年的LLMs更令人印象深刻。我听说OpenAI的山姆·奥尔特曼在一次采访中亲自说过，他们并没有想到ChatGPT会引起这么大的关注，他们认为这将随着GPT4的发布而到来。那么为什么它会如此火爆呢？在我们看来，其中的魔法在于它是第一个真正将LLMs投入生产的产品。将它从演示变成实际产品。任何人都可以与之互动并提出棘手的问题，只会被其回答的出色而惊讶。演示只需要工作一次，但产品必须每次都工作，即使成千上万的用户向朋友展示它时说：“看看这个！”这种魔法正是您可以希望从阅读本书中学到的。
- en: We’re excited about writing this book. We are excited about the possibilities
    of bringing this magic to you so you can bring it to the world. LLMs are at the
    intersection between so many fields such as linguistics, mathematics, computer
    science and more. While the more you know will help you, to be an expert isn’t
    required. Expertise in any of the individual parts only raises the skill ceiling,
    not the floor to get in. Consider an expert in physics or music theory, they won’t
    automatically have the skills for music production, but they will be more prepared
    to quickly learn. LLMs are a communication tool and communicating is a skill just
    about everyone needs.

  zh: 我们对撰写这本书感到兴奋。我们对将这种魔法带给您并让您将其带给世界的可能性感到兴奋。LLMs处于许多领域的交汇处，如语言学、数学、计算机科学等。虽然知识越多越有帮助，但并不需要成为专家。对任何一个单独领域的专业知识只会提高技能的上限，而不会提高入门门槛。考虑一位物理学或音乐理论专家，他们不会自动具备音乐制作的技能，但他们将更有准备快速学习。LLMs是一种沟通工具，几乎每个人都需要沟通技能。
- en: Like all other skills, your proximity and willingness to get involved are the
    two main blockers to knowledge, not a degree or ability to notate—these only shorten
    your journey towards being heard and understood. If you don’t have any experience
    in this area, it might be good to start by just developing an intuition around
    what an LLM is and needs by going and contributing to a project like OpenAssistant.
    If you’re a human, that’s exactly what they need. By volunteering, you can start
    understanding exactly what these models train on and why. If you fall anywhere
    from no knowledge up to being a professional machine learning engineer, we’ll
    be imparting the knowledge necessary to shorten your conversations along with
    your time to understanding considerably. If you’re not interested in learning
    the theoretical underpinnings of the subject, we’ve got plenty of hands-on examples
    and projects to get your hands dirty.

- en: We’ve all heard a story by now of LLM hallucinations, but LLMs don’t need to
    be erratic. Companies like Lakera are working daily to improve security, while
    others like LangChain are making it easier to provide models with pragmatic context
    which makes them more consistent and less likely to deviate. Techniques such as
    RLHF and Chain of Thought further allow our models to align themselves with negotiations
    we’ve already accepted as people and models should understand from the get-go,
    such as basic addition or the current date, both of which are conceptually arbitrary.
    We’ll help you increase your model stability from a linguistic perspective, so
    they’ll figure out not just what are the most likely outputs, but the most useful.

  zh: 我们现在都听过有关LLM幻觉的故事，但LLMs不需要是难以预测的。像Lakera这样的公司每天都在努力提高安全性，而像LangChain这样的公司则正在使模型更易于提供实用的上下文，从而使它们更一致，更不易偏离。诸如RLHF和Chain
    of Thought之类的技术进一步使我们的模型能够与我们已经接受的谈判保持一致，人们和模型从一开始就应该理解这些谈判，比如基本的加法或当前日期，这两者在概念上都是任意的。我们将帮助您从语言角度增强模型的稳定性，因此它们不仅能找出最有可能的输出，还能找出最有用的输出。
- en: 'Something to consider as you venture further down this path is not just the
    security of what goes into your model/code, but what comes out. LLMs can sometimes
    produce outdated, factually incorrect, or even copyrighted or licensed material,
    depending on what its training data contained. LLMs are unaware of any agreements
    people make about what is supposed to be a trade secret and what can be shared
    openly. That is, unless you tell it about those agreements during training or
    through careful prompting mechanisms during inference. Indeed, the challenges
    around prompt injection giving inaccurate information primarily arise due to two
    factors: firstly, users requesting information beyond the model''s understanding;
    and secondly, the model developers not fully predicting how users will interact
    with the models or the nature of their inquiries. If you had a resource that could
    help you get a head start on that second problem, it would be pretty close to
    invaluable, wouldn’t it?'

  zh: 在您进一步深入这条道路时，需要考虑的不仅是进入模型/代码的安全性，还有出来的内容。LLMs有时可能会生成过时的、事实不正确的，甚至是版权或许可的材料，这取决于其训练数据的内容。LLMs不知道人们对什么是商业秘密和什么可以公开共享所做的任何协议。也就是说，除非您在训练期间告诉它这些协议，或者在推理期间通过仔细的提示机制告诉它。事实上，围绕提示注入产生不准确信息的挑战主要是由两个因素引起的：首先，用户请求超出了模型的理解范围；其次，模型开发者未能完全预测用户将如何与模型互动或其询问的性质。如果您有一个资源可以帮助您提前解决第二个问题，那么它将非常接近无价，不是吗？
- en: Lastly, we don’t want to artificially or untruthfully inflate your sense of
    hope with LLMs. They are resource intensive to train and run. They are hard to
    understand, and they are harder to get working how you want. They are new and
    not well-understood. The good news is that these problems are being actively worked
    on, and we’ve put in a lot of work finding implementations that are concurrent
    with writing and actively lessen the burden on you to know everything about the
    entire deep learning architecture. From quantization to Kubernetes, we’ll help
    you figure out everything you need to know to do this now with what you have.
    Maybe we’ll inadvertently convince you that it’s too much, and you should just
    purchase from a vendor. Either way, we’ll help you every step of the way to help
    you get the results you need from this magical technology.

  zh: 最后，我们不想通过LLMs人为或不真实地增加你的希望感。它们需要大量资源来训练和运行。它们很难理解，而且很难按照你的意愿使其正常运行。它们是新的，且尚未被充分理解。好消息是，这些问题正在积极解决中，我们已经付出了大量工作，找到了与写作并行的实现方法，并积极减轻了你对整个深度学习架构了解的负担。从量化到Kubernetes，我们将帮助你弄清楚你现有的一切知识。也许我们会无意中让你相信这太难了，你应该只是从供应商那里购买。无论哪种方式，我们都将在每一步为你提供帮助，以帮助你从这种神奇的技术中获得你所需要的结果。
