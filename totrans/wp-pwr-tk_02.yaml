    of fishermen out there. I should go for that huge audience. Plus, down the road,

    keyword—everything from radar scanners to toadfishing. And some of these sites
    are mature and popular. There’s zero chance that your site will show up if someone
    searches for *fishing.* Most people will likely use additional keywords, such
    as *North Carolina, bass,* or even *Randleman Lake.* So our fisherman should vastly
    narrow his site’s topic by using keywords like this: *bass fishing in Greensboro’s
    Randleman Lake.*'

    for most of us, it’s almost always a good idea to make a plan for a site before
    starting to build it. If you have too many afterthoughts, instead of growing organically,
    the resulting site can feel cobbled together, incohesive, ragtag, even jarring.

    that goal as you construct the site. The result is likely going to look organized,

    That’s called a *personal* *blog* site (in that kind of site, you don’t have to
    find a niche—you’re it).
  prefs: []

    Such sites rarely attract a large audience. For one thing, they’re generally all
    over the place, unfocused, having no clear, single topic. A few people become
    *influencers—*they get lucky and build an audience. But unless you’re already
    a celebrity, with an existing fan base eager for the details about your comings
    and goings, your personal blog will most likely attract few followers outside
    your circle. And that’s fine if you’re not concerned about generating income or

    Lake bass fishing forum for visitors to interact and share their experiences.

    site navigation easier. Let your visitors get to the content they are interested
    in with as few clicks as possible. People sometimes want to return to a site’s
    home page, so it’s good to include a menu item named *Home* on the far left of
    the menu. And, it’s customary that clicking the site title or logo also takes
    you back to the home page as well. Websites normally display the site title on
    each page (and optionally a logo image as well). These are usually found in the
    top-left corner of the pages.

    for the Instant Pot*. So don’t use those words when naming your menu items (or
    page titles). Don’t repeat *Mexican Recipes for the Instant Pot*, or even just
    *Mexican Recipes*. Your visitors *know* they are looking at a site devoted to
    recipes for the Instant Pot, so simply name the menu items *Mexican* and *Thai*.
    The phrase *Time Tested Recipes for the Instant Pot* is a given. After all, your
    site title is displayed on every page as a top headline, so there’s no need to
    repeat it in the menu.

    search tool on every page.
  prefs: []

    search term, you do need to provide a good way for visitors to locate highly specific
    information. And a search tool serves that purpose. Most themes include a basic
    search field, but you might want to use a specialized search plugin that would
    offer additional options such as drilling down, auto-completion, and perhaps thumbnail
    previews.

    and comprehensive list of links to every topic and subtopic in the entire site.
    It’s also said that sitemaps can also improve your rank with Google and AI bots.
