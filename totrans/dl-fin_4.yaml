    jargon) or *oversold* (in technical analysis jargon), which is why you believe
    the price should go up to meet the value. Therefore, you are assuming that the

    and therefore suggests that any alpha trading must not result in above-average
    returns (*alpha trading* is the act of engaging in speculative operations to perform

    start thinking about buying when a price is close to support. This is in anticipation
    of a reaction to the upside since the balance of power should shift more to the
    demand (positive) side, where traders accept to pay a higher price as they expect
    an even higher price in the future (remember the price-to-value argument discussed
    earlier). The implication here is that most traders see a price that is lower
    than the value.

    with ascending channels, you need to be focusing more on buying whenever the market
    reverts to the support zone. That’s because you want the invisible hand of the
    bullish pressure to increase your probability of a winning trade. Similarly, in
    the case of a descending channel, focus more on short selling whenever the market
    reaches the upper limit. The full version of Zweig’s axiom goes as follows: “The
    trend is your friend, until the end when it bends.” This means that at any point
    in time, the market may change its regime, and any friendship with the trend gets
    terminated. In the end, charting analysis is subjective in nature and relies more
    on the experience of the trader or analyst.'

  zh: “趋势是你的朋友。”这句话是由马丁·兹威格创造的，意思是在上升通道中，您需要更多地关注每当市场回归到支撑区域时进行买入。这是因为您希望多头压力的隐形之手增加您获胜交易的概率。同样，在下降通道的情况下，更多地关注每当市场达到上限时进行卖空。兹威格的格言的完整版本如下：“趋势是你的朋友，直到它弯曲结束。”这意味着在任何时候，市场可能改变其制度，与趋势的任何友谊都将终止。最终，图表分析是主观的，更依赖于交易员或分析师的经验。
