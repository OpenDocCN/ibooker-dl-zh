    demand (positive) side, where traders accept to pay a higher price as they expect
    an even higher price in the future (remember the price-to-value argument discussed

    bullish pressure to increase your probability of a winning trade. Similarly, in
    the case of a descending channel, focus more on short selling whenever the market
    reaches the upper limit. The full version of Zweig’s axiom goes as follows: “The
    trend is your friend, until the end when it bends.” This means that at any point
    in time, the market may change its regime, and any friendship with the trend gets
    terminated. In the end, charting analysis is subjective in nature and relies more

    the neckline but fails to continue higher as the sellers use this level as re-entry
    to continue shorting. Therefore, the pull-back level is the theoretical optimal
    selling point after validating a double top.

    to most market participants so that its impact is bigger. Theoretically, the pattern’s
    psychological explanation is that with the second top or bottom, the market has
    failed to push the prices beyond the first peak and therefore is showing weakness,
    which might be exploited by the seller.

    debate about its utility and place relative to fundamental analysis. The important
    thing is to set expectations right and to remain within the means of logical thinking.

    and poor management. The need to make money as soon as possible to impress society
    pushes a trader to make emotional and bad decisions with regard to trades and

- en: Technical analysis looks good in the past. Everything looked obvious and easy
    to predict, even with very basic strategies; however, when you apply the latter,
    you find deceiving results due to the harsh reality that your brain is wired to
    trick you into believing the past was perfectly predictable.

    When you look at past patterns and believe that they should have been easy to
    spot, you are exhibiting *hindsight bias*. To remedy this problem, you have to
    back-test using unbiased algorithms. Only then can you know for sure if the pattern
    adds value or not. Many retail traders fall into the trap of taking a general
    and simplistic look at the past to determine the validity of their strategies,
    which then fail to perform.

- en: You’ve heard the saying “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it does often rhyme.”
    This saying is key to understanding how the markets function. When you apply technical
    analysis, you must not expect exact outcomes from past signals and patterns. Rather,
    you must use them as guidelines and probabilistic elements that suggest markets
    may have a similar reaction that can be correlated with past reactions.

- en: Trading is a numbers game, and you have to stack the odds in your favor. Humans
    sometimes do behave the same way when they are confronted with similar events.
    However, as different participants enter and leave the activity of buying and
    selling, with their motives changing all the time, you can be certain that the
    future reaction of the market after encountering a pattern similar to one in the
    past will not be exactly the same, although it might *rhyme* with the past, meaning
    it might have a correlated reaction on average.

    more than simple strategies, yet strategies must not be so sophisticated that
    you fall into the trap of *overfitting*, a common issue where traders perfectly
    predict the past and assume it will behave exactly the same in the future, thus
    resulting in huge paper gains in the past but huge real losses in the future.

    mathematically, graphically, or even psychologically (through patterns). This
    chapter has marked the end of the warm-up exercise before starting the real aim
    of the book, machine and deep learning applications for trading and forecasting
    purposes. The learning outcome of this chapter should be in the form of a deep
    understanding what technical analysis is and what are its limitations. Similarly,
    you should also have a deep understanding in the two main technical indicators
    I have presented: moving averages and the RSI as they form key features in the
