    Before applying language models to large data sets, it is crucial to compare models
    offered by different providers. That way, you get the optimal tradeoff between
    cost and quality for your specific scenario. The chapter discusses some of the
    most popular providers, their models, and the libraries they offer.

    It covers topics such as prompt engineering, the optimal tuning of model configuration
    parameters, and fine-tuning, a process by which a language model is specialized
    for one specific task. As shown in this chapter, using those methods can yield
    significant improvements in terms of quality and cost.

    for developing complex applications on top of language models: LangChain and LlamaIndex.
    Both can be useful for data analysis. In particular, the chapter shows how to
    use those frameworks to build agents, an approach that enables language models
    to solve complex data analysis tasks using a variety of computational tools.'
