    hand. You would start by analyzing the problem. What patterns of pixels tend to
    indicate the presence of a cat? What patterns of DNA tend to distinguish coding
    regions from noncoding ones? You would write computer code to recognize particular
    types of features, then try to identify combinations of features that reliably
    produce the result you want. This process is slow and labor-intensive, and depends
    heavily on the expertise of the person carrying it out.

    function by hand, you allow the computer to learn its own function based on data.
    You collect thousands or millions of images, each labeled to indicate whether
    it includes a cat. You present all of this training data to the computer, and
    let it search for a function that is consistently close to 1 for the images with
    cats and close to 0 for the ones without.

    you create a *model* that defines some large class of functions. The model includes
    *parameters*, variables that can take on any value. By choosing the values of
    the parameters, you select a particular function out of all the many functions
    in the class defined by the model. The computer’s job is to select values for
    the parameters. It tries to find values such that, when your training data is
    used as input, the output is as close as possible to the corresponding targets.

    a linear model (in one dimension, that means a straight line) simply cannot fit
    most real datasets. The problem becomes even worse when you move to very high-dimensional
    data. No linear combination of pixel values in an image will reliably identify
    whether the image contains a cat. The task requires a much more complicated nonlinear
    model. In fact, any model that solves that problem will necessarily be *very*
    complicated and *very* nonlinear. But how can we formulate it in a generic way?
    The space of all possible nonlinear functions is infinitely complex. How can we
    define a model such that, just by choosing values of parameters, we can create
    almost any nonlinear function we are ever likely to want?

    of gradient descent, we need to loop over every sample in the training set. That
    means the time required to train the model is proportional to the size of the
    training set! Suppose that you have one million samples in the training set, that
    computing the gradient of the loss for one sample requires one million operations,
    and that it takes one million steps to find a good model. (All of these numbers
    are fairly typical of real deep learning applications.) Training will then require
    *one quintillion* operations. That takes quite a long time, even on a fast computer.

    points to understand about it.
  id: totrans-72

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在讨论特定的正则化技术之前，有两个非常重要的要点需要了解。
- en: 'First, the best way to avoid overfitting is *almost always* to get more training
    data. The bigger your training set, the better it represents the “true” data distribution,
    and the less likely the learning algorithm is to overfit. Of course, that is sometimes
    impossible: maybe you simply have no way to get more data, or the data may be
    very expensive to collect. In that case, you just have to do the best you can
    with the data you have, and if overfitting is a problem, you will have to use
    regularization to avoid it. But more data will probably lead to a better result
    than regularization.'
  id: totrans-73
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 首先，避免过拟合的最佳方法 *几乎总是* 获得更多的训练数据。您的训练集越大，它越能更好地代表“真实”数据分布，学习算法过拟合的可能性就越小。当然，有时这是不可能的：也许您根本无法获得更多数据，或者收集数据可能非常昂贵。在这种情况下，您只能尽力利用手头的数据，如果过拟合是一个问题，您将不得不使用正则化来避免它。但更多的数据可能会比正则化产生更好的结果。
- en: Second, there is no universally “best” way to do regularization. It all depends
    on the problem. After all, the training algorithm doesn’t know that it’s overfitting.
    All it knows about is the training data. It doesn’t know how the true data distribution
    differs from the training data, so the best it can do is produce a model that
    works well on the training set. If that isn’t what you want, it’s up to you to
    tell it.
  id: totrans-74
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 其次，没有普遍“最佳”的正则化方法。这一切都取决于问题。毕竟，训练算法并不知道自己正在过拟合。它只知道训练数据。它不知道真实数据分布与训练数据的差异，因此它能做的最好就是生成一个在训练集上表现良好的模型。如果这不是您想要的，那就由您告诉它。
- en: 'That is the essence of any regularization method: biasing the training process
    to prefer certain types of models over others. You make assumptions about what
    properties a “good” model should have, and how it differs from an overfit one,
    and then you tell the training algorithm to prefer models with those properties.
    Of course, those assumptions are often implicit rather than explicit. It may not
    be obvious what assumptions you are making by choosing a particular regularization
    method. But they are always there.'
  id: totrans-75
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这就是任何正则化方法的本质：偏向训练过程，更喜欢某些类型的模型而不是其他类型。您对“好”模型应该具有哪些特性以及它与过拟合模型有何不同做出假设，然后告诉训练算法更喜欢具有这些特性的模型。当然，这些假设通常是隐含的而不是明确的。通过选择特定的正则化方法，您可能不清楚自己做出了什么假设。但它们总是存在的。
- en: One of the simplest regularization methods is just to train the model for fewer
    steps. Early in training, it tends to pick up on coarse properties of the training
    data that likely apply to the true distribution. The longer it runs, the more
    likely it is to start picking up on fine details of particular training samples.
    By limiting the number of training steps, you give it less opportunity to overfit.
    More formally, you are really assuming that “good” parameter values should not
    be too different from whatever values you start training from.
  id: totrans-76
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 最简单的正则化方法之一就是减少模型的训练步骤。在训练初期，模型倾向于捕捉到训练数据的粗略特性，这些特性可能适用于真实分布。它运行得越久，就越有可能开始捕捉特定训练样本的细节。通过限制训练步骤的数量，您减少了过拟合的机会。更正式地说，您实际上是假设“好”的参数值不应该与您开始训练时的值有太大的不同。
- en: Another method is to restrict the magnitude of the parameters in the model.
    For example, you might add a term to the loss function that is proportional to
    <math><msup><mrow><mo>|</mo><mi>θ</mi><mo>|</mo></mrow> <mn>2</mn></msup></math>
    , where <math><mi>θ</mi></math> is a vector containing all of the model’s parameters.
    By doing this, you are assuming that “good” parameter values should not be any
    larger than necessary. It reflects the fact that overfitting often (though not
    always) involves some parameters becoming very large.
  id: totrans-77
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 另一种方法是限制模型中参数的大小。例如，您可以向损失函数添加一个与 <math><msup><mrow><mo>|</mo><mi>θ</mi><mo>|</mo></mrow>
    <mn>2</mn></msup></math> 成比例的项，其中 <math><mi>θ</mi></math> 是包含模型所有参数的向量。通过这样做，您假设“好”的参数值不应该比必要的大。这反映了过拟合通常（虽然不总是）涉及一些参数变得非常大的事实。
- en: 'A very popular method of regularization is called *dropout*. It involves doing
    something that at first seems ridiculous, but actually works surprisingly well.
    For each hidden layer in the model, you randomly select a subset of elements in
    the output vector <math><msub><mi>h</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></math> and set them
    to 0\. On every step of gradient descent, you pick a different random subset of
    elements. This might seem like it would just break the model: how can you expect
    it to work when internal calculations keep randomly getting set to 0? The mathematical
    theory for why dropout works is a bit complicated. Very roughly speaking, by using
    dropout you are assuming that no individual calculation within the model should
    be too important. You should be able to randomly remove any individual calculation,
    and the rest of the model should continue to work without it. This forces it to
    learn redundant, highly distributed representations of data that make overfitting
    unlikely. If you are unsure of what regularization method to use, dropout is a
    good first thing to try.'

    The design of CNNs was originally inspired by the workings of the feline visual
    cortex. (Cats have played a central role in deep learning from the dawn of the
    field.) Research performed from the 1950s to the 1980s revealed that vision is
    processed through a series of layers. Each neuron in the first layer takes input
    from a small region of the visual field (its *receptive field*). Different neurons
    are specialized to detect particular local patterns or features, such as vertical
    or horizontal lines. Cells in the second layer take input from local clusters
    of cells in the first layer, combining their signals to detect more complicated
    patterns over a larger receptive field. Each layer can be viewed as a new representation
    of the original image, described in terms of larger and more abstract patterns
    than the ones in the previous layer.

- en: CNNs mirror this design, sending an input image through a series of layers.
    In that sense, they are just like MLPs, but the structure of each layer is very
    different. MLPs use *fully connected layers*. Every element of the output vector
    depends on every element of the input vector. CNNs use *convolutional layers*
    that take advantage of spatial locality. Each output element corresponds to a
    small region of the image, and only depends on the input values in that region.
    This enormously reduces the number of parameters defining each layer. In effect,
    it assumes that most elements of the weight matrix <math><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">M</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></math>
    are 0, since each output element only depends on a small number of input elements.

    the same for *every local region of the image*. If a layer uses one set of parameters
    to detect horizontal lines at one location in the image, it also uses exactly
    the same parameters to detect horizontal lines everywhere else in the image. This
    makes the number of parameters for the layer independent of the size of the image.
    All it has to learn is a single *convolutional kernel* that defines how output
    features are computed from any local region of the image. That local region is
    often very small, perhaps 5 by 5 pixels. In that case, the number of parameters
    to learn is only 25 times the number of output features for each region. This
    is tiny compared to the number in a fully connected layer, making CNNs much easier
    to train and much less susceptible to overfitting than MLPs.'

    Not so with an RNN. The model has its own internal state, composed of the outputs
    of all its layers from the most recent step. Each time you feed a new value into
    the model, the output depends not just on the input value but also on the internal
    state. Likewise, the internal state is altered by each new input value. This makes
