  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book introduces you to the fascinating intersection of biology and deep
    learning. It’s written for both biologists eager to acquire computational skills
    and computational practitioners curious about applying their expertise to biological
    problems. This fusion of disciplines is already transforming biotechnology and
    medicine—and is poised to become foundational across the life sciences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The material in this book is pitched to be introductory, guiding you from the
    basics to more intermediate concepts. We aim to balance practical code examples
    with clear explanations, making new terms and ideas accessible. Real-world Python
    code appears early and often, helping you develop hands-on intuition. While deep
    learning is a powerful tool, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution—we emphasize
    the importance of understanding your data and framing your problem thoughtfully
    before diving into modeling. We encourage you to start simple, build modular and
    debuggable code, and add complexity only when it serves a clear purpose.

- en: Although this book is designed for beginners, each chapter builds on the last
    to develop a practical, end-to-end workflow for applying machine learning to biological
    data. Our goal is to equip you with tools that are robust enough to solve real-world
    problems and flexible enough to adapt to your own research questions. In the final
    chapter, for example, we reproduce key results from a recent *Nature Methods*
    paper that uses deep learning to uncover spatial protein patterns in microscopy
    images.

    and model architectures come in and out of fashion. The core ideas you’ll learn—how
    to structure projects, prepare data, build and evaluate models, and connect predictions
    to biological questions—will remain useful regardless of the framework or trend.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for anyone interested in using deep learning to solve biological
    problems—whether you’re a biologist, a data scientist, or a software engineer.
    We have aimed to provide an accessible bridge between disciplines and a practical
    foundation for working in this emerging field. We’ve designed the book to be user-friendly
    and interdisciplinary, with the goal of supporting readers from a wide variety
    of backgrounds.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The short answer is that there just aren’t many educational resources for people
    who want to work at the intersection of biology and machine learning. Most materials
    either focus heavily on one field or assume deep prior knowledge in both. We set
    out to write the book we wished we had when we were getting started—something
    approachable, hands-on, and grounded in real biological problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While this book is far from perfect (please do send us your suggestions and
    extensions), we hope it offers a helpful and motivating starting point—and maybe
    even inspires some readers to pursue a career in this exciting, fast-moving field.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We assume a basic familiarity with Python and the core scientific Python libraries—namely,
    NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. You don’t need to be an expert programmer, but
    you should feel comfortable reading and writing basic Python code. If you’re new
    to Python, there are many excellent tutorials and courses available online to
    help you get started. We particularly recommend the [Codecademy Python online
    course](https://oreil.ly/oLar3), and the free book [*Automate the Boring Stuff
    with Python*](https://oreil.ly/uEGbU) by Al Sweigart.

    loss functions, training steps, overfitting, and feedforward neural networks will
    come up frequently. If these are unfamiliar, don’t worry—brief explanations are
    included throughout the book, and you can always pause to brush up using external
    resources as needed.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This book focuses primarily on the “small” side of biology: molecules, cells,
    and tissues. There are two main reasons for this. First, our backgrounds are in
    molecular and cellular biology, which naturally influenced the topics we chose.
    Second, most deep learning applications in biology so far have concentrated on
    this space, largely due to the availability of large-scale datasets and the quantitative
    nature of the field.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That said, the techniques and workflows in this book are broadly applicable,
    and we hope that readers interested in other biological areas—such as ecology,
    neuroscience, or zoology—will also find inspiration and useful tools here. We’re
    excited to see deep learning methods continue to spread across the life sciences.
