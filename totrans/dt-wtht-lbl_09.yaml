    case studies, and navigated the foundational challenges of unsupervised learning
    solutions. But machine learning, like any other discipline, art, or sport, has
    no finish line. It’s a constantly evolving field wherein constant upgradation
    is required, and to truly be a master, you must adapt and improve, innovate and
    learn, and push the boundaries of what you know.'

    unsupervised learning. We will cover much more advanced topics that separate good
    data scientists from great ones: deep learning, autoencoders, generative AI, and
    patterns that scale across large applications. We will also cover the end-to-end
    lifecycle of a machine learning project, including deployment and maintenance.'

    and paste. These advanced techniques are about developing a much more sophisticated
    system that can be used for datasets like text, images, and videos. It’s about
    making more bespoke solutions that are customizable as well as scalable. These
    solutions don’t just work today but will work tomorrow too.
