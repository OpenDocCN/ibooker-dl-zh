<p>The data, information, knowledge, wisdom (DIKW) pyramid and the use of generative AI have helped you to build a data story tailored to the audience. First, you have turned data into information by extracting interesting insights using different techniques, such as connections, coincidences, curiosity, and contradictions. You have built a basic chart representing the extracted insight using Altair and GitHub Copilot. Next, you have turned information into knowledge by adding context to your chart, which can be textual or visual. You have used ChatGPT to generate the textual context and DALL-E for the visual context. Finally, you have turned knowledge into wisdom, adding the next steps to your story. You have learned that there are different types of next steps, including awareness and campaigns, collaborative efforts, advocacy and policy, training and development, strategic actions, and engagement and communications. Each of them depends on the specific objective you want to achieve.</p>

<p>In chapter 11, you’ll learn popular strategies for publishing your data story using Streamlit, Tableau, Power BI, and Comet. You will use Streamlit as a standalone framework for building web applications. You will also learn how to integrate your data story into two popular tools for data storytelling: Tableau and Power BI. Finally, you’ll use Comet, an experimentation platform for machine learning that also offers a system for report building. Finally, you’ll see how to split a single-chart data story into multiple slides for a live presentation.</p>
