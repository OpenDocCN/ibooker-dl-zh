      <p class="subtitle">The first five chapters of the book<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="generative AI" data-secondary="business cases" id="xi_generativeAIbusinesscases6345" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="business cases" id="xi_businesscases6345" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="implementation of generative AI" data-secondary="business cases" id="xi_implementationofgenerativeAIbusinesscases6345" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> focused on technical aspects related to cloud native architectures for generative AI, advanced capabilities with Azure OpenAI and other Azure services, and the operationalization of generative AI in the enterprise, including topics such as LLMOps and responsible AI. In <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#implementing_cloud_native_generative_ai_with_azure" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Chapter 3</a>, we even explored detailed technical approaches that leverage different Azure resources, with recommendations depending on the project scope and type of company data. </p>
      <p class="subtitle">One of the main motivations for companies to adopt Azure OpenAI, and LLMs in general, is to generate significant advantages in the form of savings by automating language-based scenarios, or to create differentiation, to offer something better than their competitors, with the potential for increased revenue.</p>
      <p class="subtitle">In this chapter, we will focus on the business considerations of building a generative AI project with Azure OpenAI Service, including project planning and evaluation topics such as cost scenarios and estimations, ROI, roadmapping, etc. We will cover the key aspects that will allow any technical implementation to become a sustainable and feasible generative AI initiative.</p>

A bit less known than the <em class="hyperlink">postmortem</em> (in which we analyze a project after we have finished it), the <em class="hyperlink">premortem</em> is done before starting the project, by assuming that it has already failed, and then trying to identify the factors that caused the failure. This is a powerful tool for generative AI and any AI project, given the complexity and uncertainty of this type of implementation, because it can include any technical or business topic as a way to identify potential risks and to create a mitigation plan.</p>

        <p class="subtitle">One of the most challenging activities for complex AI projects is to plan activities in a granular way, and to elaborate detailed roadmaps that specify major categories of work, duration, and required technical and human resources.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">This section includes a nonexhaustive methodology that will enable you as an Azure OpenAI adopter to plan your new projects, step by step. To illustrate the examples beyond the theory in the following sections, we will refer to <a href="https://oreil.ly/dGQEr" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Azure DevOps</a> (the native Azure service for project planning and more) and some of its features.</p>

For that purpose, creating categories of work (or workstreams) will help create buckets to add different activities and user stories. Following is a recommended list of workstreams (independent of each other; the bullet points don’t represent a sequential approach) for generative AI projects with Azure OpenAI Service:</p>

This is not the typical data engineering and pipelining process from nongenerative AI, in which we need to work towards a consolidated data input that will be used to train a model. Instead, the dataset will include a diverse set of “pieces” such as documents, JSON/JSONL files, and generated embeddings. Topics such as data quality measurement and improvement are still very relevant and key for successful implementations.</p>

          </div></figure>
          <p class="subtitle">In this figure, we see the distribution of roles, with the number of people per role, their scope of activity, and the level of effort compared to a regular full-time involvement. This simple visual can be your best ally when trying to present the required roles and their level of effort (number of hours per week). However, you will need to calculate them depending on the project and your company’s context. An illustrative estimation:</p>
          <ul class="stafflist">
            <li class="calibre8">
              <p class="calibre24">A prompt engineer is a highly specialized role that could be required to work on a single project part time. Depending on the scope and level of required effort, we could imagine a range of 25% to 50% of their time for one project, which would mean working on several generative AI projects at the same time (concretely, between two and four).</p>
            </li>
            <li class="calibre8">
              <p class="calibre24">On-demand roles such as compliance and RAI experts could have a maximum number of hours assigned to projects, for reactive ad hoc dedication. It depends on the project, but the average could be 5% to 10% of their time, which would represent 4 to 8 hours per week on average. Obviously, their involvement will vary depending on the project stage.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="calibre8">
              <p class="calibre24">Other roles like architects, engineers, admins, etc. will have specific knowledge required at different stages of the project. Some of them will even have two or more functional roles (e.g., an architect can initially define architecture and requirements, then play the engineering role to implement the solution). The same applies for generative AI developers, who may work on code-related activities, but also may deploy Azure OpenAI models and integrate them to the tools via APIs. All of them can go between 20% and 100% dedication, depending on the project scope.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="subtitle">Regardless of the type and number of roles, it is important to initially plan the resource requirements, to know how many people will work, how many hours per week, and during which phases of the end-to-end project. This means the important thing is to have a plan, not to look for the perfect one. The ability to plan and estimate in an accurate way will obviously depend on increasing project experience in relation to generative AI with Azure OpenAI, so it is normal to make incorrect assumptions during the first few projects. Even with that, we will have the key building blocks to prepare an initial roadmap for a generative AI project. Let’s check the details in the next section<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_businesscasesestimatingdurationandeffortofresources619897" id="id871" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_resourcesestimatingdurationandeffortof619897" id="id872" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_humanresourcesbusinesscases614940" id="id873" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>.</p>

          <h2 class="calibre21">Creating a “Living” Roadmap</h2>
          <p class="subtitle">Let’s analyze what we should have up to now: a clear understanding of the potential use cases<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="business cases" data-secondary="living roadmap, creating" id="xi_businesscaseslivingroadmapcreating6219107" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="“living” roadmap, creating" data-primary-sortas="living" id="xi_livingroadmapcreating6219107" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> and implementation approaches, an initial definition of the architecture, a preliminary idea of the required resources at both the human and tooling levels, and an estimate of the availability of the different team members.</p>
          <p class="subtitle">These are all key elements to create a project’s “living” roadmap. Let’s start from the basics. A roadmap is a visual way to communicate a plan for achieving a goal or outcome, in this case the project implementation. It includes the major steps or milestones needed to reach it, and it includes the workstreams we have previously discussed as a way to organize all required tasks. </p>
          <p class="subtitle">The concept of a “living” asset refers to the ability to evolve it from its initial version. This is especially important for AI projects (including generative AI), as preliminary roadmaps tend to evolve during the implementation phase due to unknowns (e.g., how long we need to try and test different prompts) or unexpected events (e.g., limited access to cloud platforms, temporary leaves from team members). So you can consider the roadmap a canvas to plan and evolve your implementations in a visual, easy-to-read manner, an asset you can use with both technical and business/executive stakeholders to regularly discuss plans and progress. <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_3_visual_roadmap_template_for_ai_and_generative_ai_p" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Figure 6-3</a> is an example of a visual roadmap for a generative AI project, with an illustrative case for an imaginary pharma company.</p>

          </div></figure>
          <p class="subtitle">In this kind of one-pager roadmap, the important thing is not to go into hyper-granular details, but to define the “what” and “by when” of the workstreams and activities. Using sprints to structure blocks of work for a two- to four-week period is the way to get more tangible details of the sequence and duration of the tasks.</p>
          <p class="subtitle">From an Azure point of view, once you have defined a visual roadmap (in some regular format such as a PowerPoint slide), you can implement its details via the <a href="https://oreil.ly/NKWy8" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Boards feature</a> in Azure DevOps<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Azure DevOps" id="id874" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Boards feature, Azure DevOps" id="id875" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>.

This is critical for sustainable business cases, but also to guarantee there is enough budget for the cloud-related costs (the cost structure of Azure OpenAI is well optimized for massive use, but it is still linear and depends directly on the number of interactions with the system). The challenging part is to imagine how many users will actually leverage the solution, and how.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">For that purpose, the best option is to take<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="multilevel scenario drafting approach to usage scenario" id="id878" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> a <em class="hyperlink">multilevel scenario drafting approach</em>, in which we will calculate several factors for a chat-based application with a potential number of end users, step by step:</p>
        <dl class="stafflist">
          <dt class="calibre10">Number of expected (average) users </dt>
          <dd class="calibre11">
            <p class="subtitle">This is relatively difficult for any business-to-consumer (B2C) scenario in which we may have end users arriving dynamically, or even internal employees using internal generative AI applications. That said, the idea is to establish a maximum average number of users that we know will connect actively to the final solution.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="calibre10">Number of interactions per user, by day/week/month </dt>
          <dd class="calibre11">
            <p class="subtitle">Again, it is not easy to predict how many times a user will use the solution, but we need to define a maximum number. It can be based on the number of past interactions with existing solutions, or by allocating a maximum number of sessions by day, week, or month. This maximum number can serve as a session limit at the application level, to guarantee no one overuses the solution.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="calibre10">Max length of each interaction (in tokens)</dt>
          <dd class="calibre11">
            <p class="subtitle">This is relatively simple and it applies to both prompts and completions. We can limit at both the Azure OpenAI model (via “max length” settings but also by defining the length using the system message) and application level (by limiting the number of characters and words a user can write). If we handle the maximum length for both questions and answers, we can obtain an average length for each interaction (e.g., 250 tokens for a 50-token question with a 200-token answer).</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note" class="calibre15"><h6 class="calibre16">Note</h6>
          <p class="subtitle">The general rule is 1,000 tokens equal 750 words (for English text), but it really depends on the language and type of words.

        </div>
        <p class="subtitle">If we get these three elements, we can technically imagine the maximum cost allocated to this usage scenario, by creating a very simple formula:</p>
        <div data-type="equation" class="calibre47">
          <p class="subtitle">Number of expected users × number of interactions per user (for a specific period; for this, we’ll say by month)</p>
          <p class="subtitle">× max token length of each interaction</p>
          <p class="subtitle">= total cost (aka total number of tokens by month)</p>
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle">In this case, if we have the number of interactions by month, the total amount of tokens will correspond to the total usage of tokens in one single month. If we take that amount, let’s say 2,000 users × 30 interactions × 500 tokens max, we obtain a total of 30 million tokens. </p>
        <p class="subtitle">As you know, the <a href="https://oreil.ly/7Gmq6" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">regular pricing for Azure OpenAI</a> service is based on “bags” of 1,000 tokens. This means that we pay a fixed amount (depending on the pricing of each model, which tends to change and get lower over time), in this case 30,000,000 tokens / 1,000 tokens per bag = 30,000 bags. If we assume a unit price of $0.002 (illustrative amount for a model “X”), this means 30,000 × 0.002 = 60 USD of monthly cost for Azure OpenAI usage, which means 720 USD per year. Obviously, this amount will be higher for bigger scenarios, and it does not include:</p>
        <ul class="stafflist">
          <li class="calibre8">
            <p class="calibre24">Additional Azure OpenAI costs for embedding-based scenarios. This means if we leverage embeddings, in addition to the regular chat-type capabilities, we will use a different kind of model (e.g., Embeddings Large) with specific pricing by 1,000-token interaction.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="calibre8">
            <p class="calibre24">Other implementation pieces such as Web Apps, other AI services for document intelligence, cognitive search, vector storage, speech-to-text and text-to-speech, etc. These depend on the type of solution, and can be calculated as any other cloud service, by using the official <a href="https://oreil.ly/2SQ4C" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Azure calculator</a>.</p>

PTUs offer dedicated AI resources for a specific GPT model, with latency, performance, and cost advantages, especially important for production-level scenarios.
