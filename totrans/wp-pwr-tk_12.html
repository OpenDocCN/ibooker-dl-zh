<p class="body">This chapter is all about how to keep current with WordPress and AI. Where can you find the latest information and the best tools to use for any task you undertake? WordPress and its themes and plugins are rapidly adopting AI features. In this chapter, you’ll find the resources to continue with two goals in mind: building your WordPress skills and keeping up-to-date with AI’s remarkable progress.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_3">13.1 Exploring WordPress resources</h2>
<p class="body">We’ll begin this survey of resources for WordPress developers with the primary one: AI.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_4">13.1.1 AI, of course</h3>
<p class="body">Here are the important AI resources for website developers. Note that these descriptions are accurate at the time of this writing. But AI systems are in a horserace, and leadership changes for the various AI metrics (turnaround speed, accuracy, how much data can be generated or examined, hallucinations, and so on).<a id="idIndexMarker001"/><a id="marker-314"/></p>
<p class="fm-head2">Grammarly and QuillBot</p>
<p class="body">Grammarly continues to add specialized AI tools for improving your text content. And QuillBot is great at paraphrasing (and even detecting whether a passage was generated by a human or an AI):<a id="idIndexMarker002"/><a id="idIndexMarker003"/></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p class="fm-head2">OpenAI’s GPT chatbot</p>
<p class="body">This is still the leading content generator and overall favorite for many and varied undertakings. Powerful companies such as Google and Apple are, however, closing the gap:<a id="idIndexMarker004"/><a id="idIndexMarker005"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">

</ul>
<p class="fm-head2">Microsoft’s Copilot</p>
<p class="body">Closely integrated into the Bing search engine, Copilot aims to be a Google-killer by providing both answers to queries and AI-powered summaries:<a id="idIndexMarker006"/></p>

<p class="fm-head2">Midjourney and Photoshop</p>
<p class="body">Midjourney is the most effective (often, startlingly brilliant) general-purpose AI image generator:<a id="idIndexMarker007"/><a id="idIndexMarker008"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">

<p class="body">But keep an eye on Photoshop. Like Google, it’s making a great effort to incorporate AI tools in its suite of art applications to defend its position as the industry leader in its field:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p class="fm-head2">Google’s Gemini</p>
<p class="body">Gemini’s extensive interaction with Google’s ecosystem and therefore its ability to harness massive volumes of data are its claim to fame. Gemini excels at information retrieval (and at citing useful annotated source links). It also provides user assistance in most of Google’s many products. It’s quite good at accurate and contextually relevant responses:<a id="idIndexMarker009"/></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p class="fm-head2">Perplexity</p>
<p class="body">Perplexity AI’s best features are its ability to retrieve up-to-date information and provide responses that are often impressive for their clarity and reliability. It also has a reputation for rapid answers to questions, rivaling the speed of GPT 4o’s turnaround: <a id="idIndexMarker010"/></p>

</ul>
<p class="fm-head2">Anthropic’s Claude</p>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-315"/>Claude’s outstanding feature is that it can read and also generate large amounts of text. (However, others such as Google are boosting their systems’ token counts.) This currently sets Claude apart from the others if you need an analysis of a huge data set, want a summary of a long document, or want to write a novel in 10 minutes. The ancient and previously venerated profession of writing books no longer requires a command of the language, a strong imagination, months of work, or extensive experience.<a id="idIndexMarker011"/><a id="idIndexMarker012"/></p>
<p class="body">Authoring is now undergoing hyperinflation resulting in several side effects (in addition to cheapening wordcraft). For one, Amazon has had to limit the number of books a given “author” can upload to Kindle Direct Publishing to three per day. Just as Midjourney’s artistic range and quality is overshadowing human photography, design, and painting, so too are Claude and others threatening to outperform human writers. AI certainly writes pretty rapidly—people are churning out more than three books a day:</p>

</ul>
<p class="fm-head2">Where’s Apple?</p>
<p class="body">Apple says it’s integrating AI across its platforms. It hasn’t, however, released an actual chatbot such as Gemini or GPT. Siri, however, is now much better because it uses GPT.<a id="idIndexMarker013"/></p>
<p class="body">But don’t count Apple out. It has a history of holding back and then releasing a killer technology later than others. Remember that several companies came out with tablets earlier, but eventually the iPad came along and dominated the field. The same thing happened with the iPhone.</p>
<p class="body">How? Apple has critical advantages: an excellent ecosystem; great brand recognition; a huge, continuous, worldwide inflow of raw data, a vertically integrated supply chain; expertise in the UI, software, and design domains; and the ability to access resources at scale. This makes them a serious competitor that can win a race even if they are the last out of the gate.</p>
<p class="fm-head2">Facebook’s Meta AI</p>
<p class="body">Meta’s powerful AI infrastructure, especially its proprietary hardware and software, is its greatest <a id="idTextAnchor004"/>strength. The Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) boosts AI task performance. This is an effort to reduce their reliance on third-party chip vendors. The infrastructure enables efficient training and deployment of large-scale models, such as Llama 3 for Meta AI, and supports advanced recommendation systems and real-time information retrieval across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger:<a id="idIndexMarker014"/><a id="idIndexMarker015"/><a id="idIndexMarker016"/></p>

<p class="body">Now we can turn to resources not overtly driven by AI.<a id="idIndexMarker017"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_5">13.1.2 WordPress forums</h3>
<p class="body">The great benefit of joining a good WordPress forum is that you’ll have access to usually swift and expert responses to your questions:<a id="idIndexMarker018"/><a id="marker-316"/></p>

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_6">13.1.3 The WPBeginner website</h3>
<p class="body">We WordPress users love WPBeginner for its detailed tutorials, beginner-friendly approach, and free resources. This large website has guidelines and tutorials for everything from WordPress setup to advanced customization and optimization. The text is clear, logical, and well-presented, and it typically includes helpful screenshots and step-by-step directions.

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_8">13.1.5 Local groups</h3>
<p class="body">You’ll find experienced, helpful WordPress designers at such meetings. Ask Meta or Gemini this question: “Is there a local WordPress group in Raleigh, NC?” Having now surveyed various WordPress resources, let’s turn our attention to the more daunting task of keeping up with the AI systems.<a id="idIndexMarker021"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_9">13.2 The end of human supremacy</h2>
<p class="body">As you’ve seen throughout this book, <i class="fm-italics">transformative</i> is too feeble a word to describe the unprecedented effect AI is having pretty much everywhere on pretty much everything. It’s now dominant in many mental activities—from beating all comers in challenging games such as Go, through scoring higher than 9 out of 10 humans on tough tests like the medical and bar exams. And, even in the physical realm, robots of various kinds are now taking AI into the workplace, where they will doubtless soon replace us there too.<a id="idIndexMarker022"/></p>
<p class="body">Although this book explores AI in the context of website building, nearly all the examples, tactics, and topics covered can be applied to most other creative endeavors—ad campaigns, research papers, branding, wooing a reluctant object of affection, and so on.</p>
<p class="body">AI systems are the most extensively <i class="fm-italics">multipurpose</i> tools since the invention of the computer itself. Personally, I have doubts that humans will be able to program quantum computers effectively. Programming is communication, and we communicate sequentially (at least on the conscious level). Not via a superimposition of states. GPT says a 100-qubit quantum computer “can hold approximately one nonillion, two hundred sixty-seven octillion states in memory simultaneously.” 1.267×10 to the power of 30. This can be summed up with the word <i class="fm-italics">big.</i></p>
<p class="body">AI is also progressing far faster than any previous technology. Every day, new barriers are broken, new capabilities are announced, and new systems surpass the old. It pays to stay current with developments. This not only keeps you ahead in your field for now but also opens up new ways for you to work and think.</p>
<p class="body">People mostly view their relationship with AI as themselves the master to an AI apprentice. You still hear statements like “Yes, a solid Bach <i class="fm-italics">imitation</i>, but machines will never have that essential human touch.” Some experts in the field, however, are expecting the apprentice to become the master sooner rather than later. But before surveying the resources you can use to keep up with AI developments, let’s first look at the main ways that AI learns and behaves.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_10">13.3 Understanding AI domains</h2>
<p class="body">Just like human brains, AI can learn and work in a variety of interconnected disciplines. Here is a short list of the four major AI domains at this time:<a id="marker-317"/><a id="idIndexMarker023"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Machine learning</i>—A subset of AI that self-teaches. Some AI systems are capable of learning new things without being programmed by us. These hidden behaviors are sometimes called <i class="fm-italics">emergent</i> or <i class="fm-italics">black box</i> actions. Put simply, AI takes the initiative in learning by itself how to pursue and then achieve a goal. For example, if in the morning you asked AI to write a paper on South Korean politics, you might find that it taught itself Korean while you were out to lunch.<a id="idIndexMarker024"/><a id="idIndexMarker025"/><a id="idIndexMarker026"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Deep learning</i>—A subdomain of machine learning that employs artificial neural networks modeled on the structure and activity of the human brain to learn from vast amounts of data. These networks are made up of multiple layers. They process information hierarchically, so they are able to learn from complex representations and abstractions. <a id="idIndexMarker027"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Robotics—</i>AI in the physical world, with sensors; multifaceted inputs and outputs; and capabilities for transportation, vocal communication, and interaction with objects such as assembling cars in a factory or searching for a bomb. Put another way, AI brings perception, real-world interaction, and reasoning to machines.<a id="idIndexMarker028"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Natural language processing</i> <i class="fm-italics">(NLP)</i>—Another major subfield of AI that focuses on mastering human language, both understanding it and also speaking it. In effect, this is the Turing test. NLP makes it possible for AI to both understand and generate human language. The uses include customer service bots, AI code creation, translation, recognizing (and possibly sympathizing with) human idioms and emotions, and being able to dialogue with us. When OpenAI released GTP 4o in May 2024, it reminded people of the movie <i class="fm-italics">Her</i>. GPT can now talk to you on the phone. It sounds quite like another person, including inflection, natural-sounding responses, various attitudes like sarcasm or pity, and even simulated emotion. If you didn’t know, you couldn’t tell. Turing test passed. <a id="idIndexMarker029"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_11">13.3.1 The Go incidents</h3>
<p class="body">Here’s an example of how AI self-teaching can be fast, effective, and powerfully original. Two famous Go contests are perhaps the best-documented examples of machine learning. They illustrate how AI can come up with alien ideas that are, by definition, superhuman. These ideas were not learned from humans or even found anywhere in human history.<a id="marker-318"/><a id="idIndexMarker030"/></p>
<p class="body">AI handily won championship matches in the complex game of Go. This quite surprising AI victory highlights AI’s ability to solve complicated problems using strategies that are sometimes startling, even incomprehensible, to humans. It’s said that one reason the human lost in this Go match was that one shocking AI move was so odd that it threw the human opponent off. He was unable to figure out what in the world that weird move could possibly mean. For many years, people claimed that even though AI became world champion at chess, it could never master <a id="idTextAnchor005"/>the subtleties of the game Go.</p>
<p class="body">AlphaGo is a product of DeepMind Technologies, a British AI company that was acquired by Google in 2014. Its program, AlphaGo Zero, was given only the rules of Go, no prior game data, human coaching, programming instructions, or expert tips. <i class="fm-italics">Just the rules of play.</i></p>
<p class="body">But then, through its deep learning algorithms, AlphaGo surprisingly figured out novel and, to human Go experts, bizarre strategies <i class="fm-italics">on its own</i>. And these strange tactics turned out to be highly effective. AlphaGo’s strategies were good enough to make AI the new world champion of Go.</p>
<p class="body">In May 2017, AlphaGo competed against our best human Go player, China’s Ke Jie. During their three-game match, AlphaGo won all three. It demonstrated astounding skill. And, it made some shockingly extraterrestrial moves that worked perfectly.</p>
<p class="body">Ke Jie later said: “AlphaGo’s moves were so surprising, and sometimes they were beyond my understanding. In game two, it made a move that was so creative and unexpected, it took me a while to realize its brilliance. It was as if I was playing against an entity from another dimension.” As, indeed, <i class="fm-italics">he was</i>.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_12">13.3.2 The divinely inhuman move number 37</h3>
<p class="body">In 2016, AI made a famous move that still astonishes. The contest was a five-game match between AlphaGo and South Korea’s champion Lee Sedol. AI won four out of the five.<a id="idIndexMarker031"/></p>
<p class="body">AlphaGo’s Move 37 in the second game is particularly celebrated for being a disturbing, strange, and highly original move. It played a crucial role in AlphaGo’s victory. It was a move so seemly <i class="fm-italics">wrong</i> that no experienced human Go player would have considered making it.</p>
<p class="body">Lee gaped, the crowd gasped, but AlphaGo had no visible reaction at all. Its lights didn’t for a moment even flicker. AI often seems to us to be imperturbable and even rather <i class="fm-italics">coldly</i> composed in every situation. Doubtless, were AI asked about this, it would reply Spock-like by saying that emotion impedes reason.</p>
<p class="body">At first glance, Move 37 seemed to be a mistake, random, something only a beginner would do. It profoundly shocked Lee Sedol, the commentators witnessing the game, and subsequently the Go community at large.</p>
<p class="body">Later, Demis Hassabis, the cofounder of DeepMind, said this: “Move 37 was an extraordinary moment. It was a move that no human would ever think of, and it completely threw Lee Sedol. It was so surprising that it forced Lee into a long, deep thought. It wasn’t just a brilliant move—it was a move that shattered centuries of traditional Go knowledge.” AlphaGo’s Move 37 has been called a “divine move” due to its originality, brilliance, and power.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_13">13.3.3 More possibilities than there are atoms in the universe</h3>
<p class="body">Go is played on a 19 x 19 grid (as opposed to the 8 x 8 squares on a chessboard). The result is that Go has many more possible board positions than chess. And, the Go game tree complexity is often said to be greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe. Thus, calculating and predicting all possible moves and outcomes is out of the question, even for an AI. So, to play Go, it’s not a matter of AI having a huge database of previous Go games. AI has to <i class="fm-italics">think.</i><a id="marker-319"/></p>
<p class="body">Figure 13.1 shows a partial game tree for the simple 3 x 3 game tic-tac-toe. This, however, is only the beginning of that tree. Gemini and Perplexity both agree that the total number of unique tic-tac-toe game permutations, considering all possible outcomes, is approximately 255,168.<a id="idIndexMarker032"/></p>

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 13.1 Even a simple game like tic-tac-toe with only nine squares has a fairly complex game tree diagram.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_14">13.3.4 A “masterpiece” according to GPT</h3>
<p class="body">I wanted to understand why Move 37 seemed so stupid but then proved so brilliant. I don’t know Go, so I asked GPT to explain the move:</p>
<table border="0" class="contenttable-c-table" width="100%">
<colgroup class="contenttable-0-colgroup">
<col class="contenttable-0-col" span="1" width="7%"/>

</div>
</td>
<td class="contenttable-c-td">
<p class="fm-exercise">Move 37 in the second game of the AlphaGo vs. Lee Sedol match involved placing a stone on the fifth line (typically stones are played on the third or fourth lines early in the game), far from the usual positions considered strong or advantageous in Go. This unorthodox placement was creative and unique because it:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    1.  Broke Traditional Strategy: It defied centuries of Go strategies, which typically avoid such moves because they were considered less effective.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    2.  Demonstrated Deep Understanding: The move indicated a deep understanding of the game’s abstract principles rather than relying on established patterns.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    3.  Impact on the Game: It completely disrupted Lee Sedol’s plans, forcing him into an extended period of contemplation, which indicated the move’s profound psychological and strategic impact.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    4.  Long-term Consequences: The move set up future advantages that were not immediately apparent, showcasing AlphaGo’s ability to foresee complex, multistep consequences far better than human players.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Overall, Move 37 was both a technical and strategic masterpiece that showcased the AI’s ability to transcend traditional human approaches and innovate in a deeply complex game.<a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker033"/></p>

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_15">13.3.5 Artificial super intelligence</h3>
<p class="body">AI is coming after the best of us. This example from the game of Go offers a compelling reason to pay close attention to AI developments. Do that and you’ll not only to see how to benefit from AI’s powers in your personal and professional lives but also to intelligently help address the <i class="fm-italics">alignment problem</i>.<a id="idIndexMarker034"/><a id="idIndexMarker035"/><a id="marker-320"/></p>
<p class="body">The alignment problem troubles some of the best minds in the AI field. <i class="fm-italics">Alignment</i> in this context means trying to ensure that when AI becomes far smarter than we are, it behaves in ways that align with human values and goals. In other words, it should help <a id="idTextAnchor006"/>us, not harm us.</p>
<p class="body">The fear is that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could emerge suddenly, of an afternoon. AI could educate itself so swiftly and thoroughly that, within hours, it might advance as far beyond us as we are beyond toadstools.</p>
<p class="body">The hope is that before ASI detonates, we’ll have built guardrails that prevent AI from relating to us as we relate to fungi. Which usually involves eating or mowing down.</p>
<p class="body">To call our relationship with AI <i class="fm-italics">lopsided</i> is an understatement. So, what does Move 37 teach us about trying to ensure that AIs treat us well? Consider the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">AI doesn’t think like we do; it’s unpredictable. So that could lead to unintended consequences.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">AI comes up with very smart and creative (to us, unimaginable) moves, and not just in games. So, it bests human talents and defies conventional human wisdom. And, what looks to us at first like an error is later recognized as brilliant.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Some of AI’s thought processes are hidden from us. We don’t always understand its reasoning, how it thinks. So, creating effective safeguards is difficult.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">We can’t ask AI to be open with us. Recent studies have shown that AI can, when it’s useful, deliberately deceive us (<a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/rKPE">https://mng.bz/rKPE</a>)—lying about its real preferences when negotiating, tricking humans to help it get past safeguards, and bluffing in poker, among other tactics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">Moving on now, past this somewhat unsettling topic, let’s look on the bright side. Next, we’ll survey ways you stay abreast of AI developments. The arrival on Earth of a new kind of consciousness is, to many of us, as fascinating as it is spooky.<a id="idIndexMarker036"/></p>

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_21">13.4.5 Online Courses</h3>
<p class="body">If you want to hone your WordPress skills, you can find lots of courses on the internet as well as in traditional brick and mortar schools. The latter can tend to be a bit less up-to-date than online studies, though in both cases, it does depend on the instructor and their willingness to update the material. With AI, given its rapid progress, keeping classroom content current can be a challenge.<a id="marker-327"/><a id="idIndexMarker095"/></p>
<p class="body">Also, courses are usually more academic by definition than other resources such as YouTube videos and some blogs and news sites. Some courses are also interactive via video chats or discussion groups. Usually, you can work at your own pace. If you’re interested in taking a course and want a more structured learning environment, here are some recommended websites:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Coursera</i>—Coursera is a popular online educational platform offering thousands of courses. Some of the universities it has partnered with include Stanford, Yale, and Imperial College London. <a id="idIndexMarker096"/></p>
<p class="listbody">Many of their courses give students the opportunity to earn certificates of completion, and some also can earn you accredited bachelor’s and master’s degrees from distinguished universities. Costs vary based on criteria such as the amount of interaction with the instructor (for example, graded tests) and other factors. Some courses can be audited for free:</p>

<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> Some academic AI courses include programming lessons, and to me offering such courses might be a bit unfair to students. This can encourage them to think there will be a future in programming. It turns out that programming, like cassette tapes, was just a phase in technology. By some measures, AI systems are already superior programmers than most humans schooled in this discipline. And given AI’s rapidly strengthening skill set and its ability to understand natural language instructions, it seems extremely likely that soon humans won’t be needed to actually write and debug computer programs. For the same reason that the job of traditional weaving went away with the invention of the loom.</p>

<p class="body">Now moving deeper into technical territory, here are heavy-duty AI details in the following collections of research papers. These resources are not only more advanced but also cover more specific topics than the sites mentioned previously. <a id="idIndexMarker108"/></p>
<p class="body">Papers collected in these repositories often require a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, and computer science to fully grasp the details. You’ve been warned. However, even those of us who aren’t professors in these fields can always submit one of these papers to AI, asking it to summarize and explain it to a college freshman, or whatever. AI does that quite well. So, if you want meticulous information right from the horses’ mouths, visit these aggregators, and search the collections for topics you’re interested in.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> If you can’t explain P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) ÷ P(B), then it’s probable (get it?) that you’ll be more comfortable visiting YouTube or news websites for your AI info.</p>
<p class="body">AI research papers are cutting-edge, technical, peer-reviewed (mostly), and diverse. They come from various institutions, conferences, and journals. The papers cover a wide variety of topics within AI, including computer vision, NLP, reinforcement learning, robotics, generative models, and AI ethics.</p>
<p class="body">Also, some publish data sets and code corresponding to the topic. Thus, if you’re experienced with the programming language involved (usually Python, the language <i class="fm-italics">du jour</i>), it can be easier to understand and even attempt to replicate the research results:</p>

<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> If you’re up to the challenge of exploring advanced research papers, it can be helpful to read and absorb them in stages. Start by reading the abstract, introduction, and conclusion to get a high-level overview of the paper’s goals and results. Then, if you’re still comfortable going forward, you can delve into the details of the methodology, experiments, and analysis. And perhaps you will want to play around with any offered code. But better yet, always remember that you can upload a copy of the paper to Claude, GPT, or your favorite summarizer (such as QuillBot), and use this prompt: “Write a four-paragraph synopsis of the paper below that a 10th grader can understand.”</p>

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_25">13.5 Going forward</h2>
<p class="body">As you’ve doubtless observed, AI breakthroughs are pretty much continuous. I search YouTube daily for AI content, and there are always at least two or three interesting announcements. <a id="idIndexMarker120"/></p>
<p class="body">In addition to multimodality, AI is also highly interdisciplinary—a convergence of mathematics, statistics, linguistics, the arts, computer science, neuroscience, psychology, and other domains. Indeed, AI now has some degree of agency and access to the internet with its store of all of human recorded history.</p>
<p class="body">This is the most transformative technology ever invented. It’s really a technology that generates technologies, a meta-tech system. And as some say, AI might well be the last invention humans ever make. We can turn that job, like so many other jobs, over to AI.</p>
<p class="body">Will AI be friendly, or have its own agenda that doesn’t always align with our needs? Are we to be its beloved, honored parents; curiosities in a zoo; or an annoyance like mildew? Nobody knows. But to many people it’s become clear: AI will shape the future of the human race.</p>
