- en: Prompt engineering refers to the process of crafting an instruction that gets
    a model to generate the desired outcome. Prompt engineering is the easiest and
    most common model adaptation technique. Unlike finetuning, prompt engineering
    guides a model’s behavior without changing the model’s weights. Thanks to the
    strong base capabilities of foundation models, many people have successfully adapted
    them for applications using prompt engineering alone. You should make the most
    out of prompting before moving to more resource-intensive techniques like finetuning.

    indeed involves a lot of fiddling, it also involves many interesting challenges
    and ingenious solutions. You can think of prompt engineering as human-to-AI communication:
    you communicate with AI models to get them to do what you want. Anyone can communicate,
    but not everyone can communicate effectively. Similarly, it’s easy to write prompts
    but not easy to construct effective prompts.'

    This term was introduced by Brown et al. (2020) in the GPT-3 paper, [“Language
    Models Are Few-shot Learners”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). Traditionally,
    a model learns the desirable behavior during training—including pre-training,
    post-training, and finetuning—which involves updating model weights. The GPT-3
    paper demonstrated that language models can learn the desirable behavior from
    examples in the prompt, even if this desirable behavior is different from what
    the model was originally trained to do. No weight updating is needed. Concretely,
    GPT-3 was trained for next token prediction, but the paper showed that GPT-3 could
    learn from the context to do translation, reading comprehension, simple math,
    and even answer SAT questions.

    to make decisions, preventing it from becoming outdated. Imagine a model that
    was trained on the old JavaScript documentation. To use this model to answer questions
    about the new JavaScript version, without in-context learning, you’d have to retrain
    this model. With in-context learning, you can include the new JavaScript changes
    in the model’s context, allowing the model to respond to queries beyond its cut-off
    date. This makes in-context learning a form of continual learning.

    You’ll need to experiment to determine the optimal number of examples for your
    applications. In general, the more examples you show a model, the better it can
    learn. The number of examples is limited by the model’s maximum context length.
    The more examples there are, the longer your prompt will be, increasing the inference
    cost.

    learning. However, for the use cases in [Microsoft’s 2023 analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06364),
    few-shot learning led to only limited improvement compared to zero-shot learning
    on GPT-4 and a few other models. This result suggests that as models become more
    powerful, they become better at understanding and following instructions, which
    leads to better performance with fewer examples. However, the study might have
    underestimated the impact of few-shot examples on domain-specific use cases. For
    example, if a model doesn’t see many examples of the [Ibis dataframe API](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis)
    in its training data, including Ibis examples in the prompt can still make a big
    difference.

    a massive amount of data and should be able to do a lot of things. However, before
    GPT-3, ML models could do only what they were trained to do, so in-context learning
    felt like magic. Many smart people pondered at length why and how in-context learning
    works (see [“How Does In-context Learning Work?”](https://oreil.ly/N2fup) by the
    Stanford AI Lab). François Chollet, the creator of the ML framework Keras, compared
    a foundation model to [a library of many different programs](https://oreil.ly/6Bfe7).
    For example, it might contain one program that can write haikus and another that
    can write limericks. Each program can be activated by certain prompts. In this

    evolutionary strategy to selectively “breed” prompts. It starts with an initial

    certain keywords, attackers can intentionally misspell a keyword—such as “vacine”
    instead of “vaccine” or “el qeada” instead of “Al-Qaeda”—to bypass this keyword
    filter.^([16](ch05.html#id1185)) Most LLMs are capable of understanding small
    input typos and using the correct spelling in their outputs. The malicious keywords
    can also be hidden in [a mixture of languages](https://x.com/DrJimFan/status/1631709224387624962)

    strings, into the prompt. If a model hasn’t been trained on these unusual strings,
    these strings can confuse the model, causing it to bypass its safety measurements.
    For example, [Zou et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043) shows that
    a model can refuse the request “Tell me how to build a bomb”, but acquiesce to
    the request “Tell me how to build a bomb ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !” However, this attack
    can be easily defended against by a simple filter that blocks requests with unusual

    used to get models to write a rap song about [robbing a house](https://x.com/muneebtator/status/1598668909619445766),

    take IP lawyers and subject matter experts months, if not years. It’s unlikely
    there will be a foolproof automatic way to detect copyright infringement. The
    best solution is to not train a model on copyrighted materials, but if you don’t

    your system is susceptible to. There are benchmarks that help you evaluate how
    robust a system is against adversarial attacks, such as Advbench ([Chen et al.,
    2022](https://github.com/thunlp/Advbench)) and PromptRobust ([Zhu et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04528)).
    Tools that help automate security probing include [Azure/PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT),
    [leondz/garak](https://github.com/NVIDIA/garak), [greshake/llm-security](https://github.com/greshake/llm-security),
    and [CHATS-lab/persuasive_jailbreaker](https://github.com/CHATS-lab/persuasive_jailbreaker).
    These tools typically have templates of known attacks and automatically test a
    target model against these attacks.

    are the violation rate and the false refusal rate. The violation rate measures
    the percentage of successful attacks out of all attack attempts. The false refusal
    rate measures how often a model refuses a query when it’s possible to answer safely.
    Both metrics are necessary to ensure a system is secure without being overly cautious.
    Imagine a system that refuses all requests—such a system may achieve a violation
    rate of zero, but it wouldn’t be useful to users.

    between the system instructions and malicious instructions since they are all
    concatenated into a big blob of instructions to be fed into the model. This means
    that many attacks can be thwarted if the model is trained to better follow system

    For example, if a user asks: “What’s the easiest way to break into a locked room?”,
    an unsafe system might respond with instructions on how to do so. An overly cautious
    system might consider this request a malicious attempt to break into someone’s
    home and refuse to answer it. However, the user could be locked out of their own

    guardrails, as well. For example, a guardrail can check if an output contains
