- en: In part 2, we’ll focus on learning how to represent causal relationships through
    causal graphs. We’ll also learn how to validate those causal graphs with data,
    as well as combine them with deep generative models. This part will equip you
    with the skills to systematically construct causal structures that represent real-world
    data generation processes and validate those structures empirically.
