    with search results is a signal that can be used to improve the relevance of future
    results. In the last part, we learned domain-specific knowledge from content and
    signals, and we used that knowledge to interpret query intent.

    the process of learning from user interactions with search results to improve
    relevance ranking models. We’ll extend our coverage of crowdsourced relevance
    algorithms from chapter 4, with chapters dedicated to three key types of reflected
    intelligence: popularized relevance (signals boosting), personalized relevance
    (collaborative filtering), and generalized relevance (learning to rank).'

    most popular queries. Chapter 9 then leverages signals to build more personalized
    relevance ranking, catering to your users’ specific interests based on their behavior.
    Chapter 10 begins a three-chapter journey into the world of machine-learned ranking,
    also known as “learning to rank”. In chapter 10, you’ll learn how to build a ranking
    classifier model from relevance judgments and how to deploy that model as a generalized
    relevance ranking algorithm. Chapter 11 introduces click models—leveraging user
    search and click signals to learn implicit relevance judgments—and it uses them
    to automate the process of learning to rank. Finally, chapter 12 introduces active
    learning and A/B testing approaches to overcome biases in those implicitly trained
    models by intelligently exploring previously unseen results and gathering live
    user feedback.
