   <p>Complex chatbots cause pain for builders and users alike. A complex workflow is difficult for builders to maintain and for users to navigate. Complexity reduces the chances of users completing workflows successfully, defeating the value proposition of AI technology.</p>

   <p>Nobody sets out to build a complex solution. Everyone wants something simple. But as new features are added and new wrinkles are considered, suddenly complexity may appear out of nowhere! This part of the book shows how to tame complexity.</p>

   <p>Chapter 8 presents several example dialogue flows and shows how you can remove complexity from them by making processes easier for users to complete. Chapter 9 reduces complexity by using all the context available to a process, personalizing process flows and adapting them for their delivery channels. Chapter 10 uses LLMs to reduce complexity in chatbots at both build time and run time.</p>
