<p class="body">A WordPress <i class="fm-italics">plugin</i> is like an <i class="fm-italics">extension</i> in Chrome, Edge, or Safari (Firefox calls them <i class="fm-italics">add-ons</i>). Plugins are typically small programs that can be installed in WordPress to add functionality. Examples include spam blockers, e-commerce managers, apps that help improve the site’s rank in Google or AI searches, contact form builders, security systems, and many others.<a id="idIndexMarker000"/><a id="idIndexMarker001"/><a id="idIndexMarker002"/></p>
<p class="body">You can find more than 50,000 plugins in the WordPress plugin directory (<a class="url" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/</a>). And thousands more plugins are available from third-party websites.</p>
<p class="body">It can be daunting for site owners to find just the right plugins to improve their websites. That’s where this chapter comes in. Here, you’ll find</p>

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_3">5.1 Installing the essential plugins</h2>
<p class="body">Clearly, different sites need different plugins, but there are a few that most site builders agree are essential. Here’s the list of plugins that I recommend you consider adding to your site, whatever kind it is:<a id="idIndexMarker003"/><a id="marker-113"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">UpdraftPlus</i>—First things first: install security plugins right away. UpdraftPlus is a comprehensive backup-and-restore system allowing you to perform complete manual or scheduled backups of your site. You can save your backups in various storage options such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and currently 10 other locations. This plugin is highly rated and popular because it’s easy to use, has extensive features, and is reliable. Recall that quality hosting services do their own daily backups, but redundancy in this context is worthwhile. It comes in both free and paid versions, and for many sites, the free version works quite well. <a id="idIndexMarker004"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Wordfence</i>—Adding this widely respected security program is another layer of protection for your site. But should an invader somehow get past Wordfence, you can still recreate your site by restoring a recent UpdraftPlus backup. You installed Wordfence along with UpdraftPlus in an earlier chapter. It has a comprehensive suite of protection features: a firewall; real-time monitoring with optional alerts; and a malware scanner that checks your site’s core files, themes, plugins, and other installed components for backdoors, spam, malicious redirects, code injections, and more. Finally, it monitors the integrity of your site’s files, ensuring they remain secure and unaltered. It’s freemium, coming in both free and premium versions.<a id="idIndexMarker005"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="fm-calloute"><span class="fm-callout-head">warning</span> Estimates vary, but it’s said there are more than a half million new pieces of malware on the internet per day. Over a decade ago, new malware started outnumbering normal, benign software. And the ratio has been widening since. There are various malware species: worms, trojan horses, viruses, spyware, ransomware, rootkits, and some that haven’t been categorized or that we don’t know about yet. But they all have one thing in common: they exploit computers and websites without the owners’ consent. And you surely don’t want your site to become a victim.</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Akismet</i>—Here’s a third security-related plugin, and its job is to block spam. That’s particularly important for sites that include a blog page that allows visitors to post messages. When you permit messages to be sent to your site, that’s a doorway for spam, just as your email account can suffer from spam. Another spam entrance is a contact form—a form your visitors fill out and submit to your site’s email address. Akismet employs AI tools and checks potential spam against its global database of known spam to greatly reduce these unwanted messages. Akismet is free for personal use, but commercial use requires payment.<a id="marker-114"/><a id="idIndexMarker006"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Easy Google Fonts by Titanium Themes</i>—Your theme determines which typefaces are available to you, and often there are only a few. However, Easy Google Fonts adds more than 1,400 typefaces. So, if you want to use the popular Verdana font for your body text, for example, you might want to add this plugin to your collection. (The Twenty Sixteen theme we use in this book’s practice site has only 17 fonts, but Verdana <i class="fm-italics">is</i> one of them.) This plugin also offers additional options and features in its Settings &gt; Easy Google Fonts screen.<a id="idIndexMarker007"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="fm-calloute"><span class="fm-callout-head">warning</span> Worthwhile as it is, there are some privacy concerns related to the Easy Google Fonts plugin. You might want to take a look <a id="idTextAnchor003"/>at this: <a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/mRn8">https://mng.bz/mRn8</a>. Also, it’s not being kept up-to-date. But many people still use it without problems. That said, if you prefer, you can use the Fonts Plugin or Google Fonts Typography instead.</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">SeedProd</i>—You installed this plugin in an earlier chapter. One of its features replaces your pages with Coming Soon pages. While you’re still building the site, you don’t want visitors to be judging it while unfinished. But SeedProd has quite a few other features you might want to explore. There’s much more to SeedProd (particularly in its pro version) than just Under Construction page substitutes.<a id="idIndexMarker008"/></p>
<p class="list">One of its most important features is a powerful drag-and-drop page builder. Page builder plugins assist you in layout and other elements of a page when you’re creating or modifying it. Three highly recommended page builders are Elementor, Divi, and SeedProd, with some reviewers listing SeedProd as the best. SeedProd offers the following:<a id="idIndexMarker009"/><a id="idIndexMarker010"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body-dialogb">   <span class="cambria">o</span>   Quite a few well-designed home page templates (not just the Coming Soon selections, but real home page designs)<a id="idIndexMarker011"/></p>

<p class="body-dialogb">   <span class="cambria">o</span>   Search engine optimization (SEO) and analytics settings<a id="idIndexMarker012"/></p>
<p class="fm-calloute"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> SEO attempts to improve your site’s ranking in search engines or AI. Analytics gather data about how visitors deal with your site—how long they stay on a page, which pages are viewed, and other information that can help you improve your site. Both SEO and analytics are covered in later chapters.<a id="idIndexMarker013"/></p>
<p class="body-dialogb">   <span class="cambria">o</span>   WooCommerce integration (a popular e-commerce plugin)<a id="idIndexMarker014"/></p>

<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Google XML Sitemaps</i>—This plugin is a must for SEO and AIO. Google XML Sitemaps is free, easy to use, and effective. Plus, for optimizing your position in Google searches, who better to assist you than Google itself? The plugin is lightweight too. It won’t slow down your site or take up a lot of space, but it does help Google and other search engines such as Bing understand how your site is structured and, as a result, judge it more accurately. The plugin is very simple, does its mapping job, and usually doesn’t requir<a id="idTextAnchor005"/>e any support. <a id="idIndexMarker015"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">All in One SEO (AIOSEO)</i>—This WordPress plugin offers a wide range of website optimization features that can improve your site’s search rank. Some of its benefits and features include the following:<a id="marker-115"/><a id="idIndexMarker016"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body-dialogb">   <span class="cambria">o</span>   Built-in support for WordPress schema markup. This can help you attract more visitors.

<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">MonsterInsights</i>—This very popular WordPress plugin makes it easy to connect your website to Google Analytics (one of the best plugins to provide you with data that can help you improve your site’s SEO rank and also grow your audience). Benefits include the following:<a id="idIndexMarker017"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body-dialogb">   <span class="cambria">o</span>   Advanced tracking that lets you understand your audience better. For example, this tool provides data that can help you get more insights into your website performance and visitor behaviors, so you can make data-driven decisions to grow your audience or business.</p>
<p class="body-dialogb">   <span class="cambria">o</span>   Simplifies finding and viewing data reports.</p>
<p class="body-dialogb">   <span class="cambria">o</span>   Helps you grow your email list and improve sales.</p>
<p class="body-dialogb">   <span class="cambria">o</span>   Lists the keywords that send you the most traffic.</p>

<p class="body-dialogb">   <span class="cambria">o</span>   Tracks form conversions so you can see which forms on your site are performing best and optimize the others for better results.</p>
<p class="body-ind">By using this information, you can make informed decisions about improving your website’s content and marketing strategies to increase engagement, traffic, and sales. MonsterInsights displays its easy-to-understand reports right in your WordPress admin area (Dashboard).</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Jetpack</i>—This popular WordPress plugin offers a set of quality tools and features for security, performance, marketing, and design. It’s actually a collection of many plugins (that Jetpack calls <i class="fm-italics">modules</i>). Some of the most useful modules are Carousel (animate a set of images), Contact Form (have visitors send you information about themselves, particularly their email address), Tiled Galleries (a collection of several images in various layouts), and Widget Visibility (gives you control over sidebar content—more on <a id="idTextAnchor007"/>sidebars shortly).<a id="idIndexMarker018"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">

</ul>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_4">5.1.1 Advanced Editor Tools</h3>
<p class="body">You should add the Advanced Editor Tools plugin because it expands the features of the classic editor. Figure 5.1 shows you the default toolbar in the Edit Page screen.<a id="idIndexMarker020"/><a id="idIndexMarker021"/><a id="marker-116"/></p>

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_5">5.1.2 WP R<a id="idTextAnchor008"/>ocket</h3>
<p class="body">Many consider WP Rocket to be the best all-around, full-service performance plugin. Its primary function is to maximize site performance (such as speeding up page display) using various optimizations. Among other strategies, WP Rocket offers efficient <i class="fm-italics">caching</i>. That said, you might want to check with your hosting service. Some hosts don’t want you to add caching plugins to your site because they perform caching on their end. Also, if you run into an unexplained bug on your site, try disabling your caching plugin to see if the bug goes away. Caching plugins are one of the main causes of plugin conflicts.<a id="idIndexMarker022"/><a id="idIndexMarker023"/><a id="idIndexMarker024"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Definition</span> <i class="fm-italics">Caching</i> means storing whole pages, so the browser doesn’t have to redraw a page the next time it’s viewed. If cached, a page can just be slapped into the visitor’s browser window, no processing required. In addition to the text or media, a web page includes hidden HTML and CSS codes that describe things such as layout, headline sizes, font color, and so on. Without caching, each page—even if nothing has been<a id="idTextAnchor009"/> changed in it—must be re-rendered before it’s displayed.<a id="marker-119"/><a id="idIndexMarker025"/></p>
<p class="body">In addition to caching web pages, WP Rocket also employs other types of caching. It offers cache <i class="fm-italics">preloading</i> (anticipating, then rendering in advance, what page you’re most likely to view next). It also compresses. One type of compression is called <i class="fm-italics">code minification</i>—it removes unneeded characters (such as programmer comments and whitespace). For one example, instead of storing five blank lines, it stores only three characters <code class="fm-code-in-text">5bl</code> (this <i class="fm-italics">describes</i> the number of blank lines rather than actually storing a mirror image of all the characters in all the lines). This tactic makes code files smaller, so they load more quickly and require less bandwidth to transmit. <a id="idIndexMarker026"/><a id="idIndexMarker027"/></p>
<p class="body">Similarly, WP Rocket <i class="fm-italics">concatenates</i> your site’s page files—combining multiple code files into a single file. If not concatenated, to render a page, the browser must make multiple individual requests to your site’s database (stored on your hosting service’s drives)—one request for each file of the several that make up the page. If the files are merged, only one request is needed, and the result is faster load times and improved overall site performance. It’s similar to the difference between researching via Google and asking GPT a question. Google gives you a list of several results that you then must look at individually and sometimes merge into a final answer. GPT does that for you: displaying a single, finished answer to your question.<a id="idIndexMarker028"/></p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">
<p class="fm-sidebar-title">AI plugins and tools</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">As with every other mental tool, AI is now being included in WordPress plugins. Some of these plugins you can ignore. They provide no added value because you can just as easily visit an AI system’s website directly to get the same results. For example, there’s no need to install an AI plugin to help you choose your site’s title. Just submit a prompt for a list of titles for your site’s topic to an AI assistant website such as Claude (<a class="url" href="https://claude.ai">https://claude.ai</a>). (And while you’re at it, ask Claude to ensure that none of the titles it suggests are already in use.)</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Other AI plugins, however, can add useful functionality and should be installed if your site would benefit. For example, responding to user queries can be tedious or impossibly time-consuming. So, why not add a chatbot to your site and let it deal with customer service questions?</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Or, you can also quickly modify chatbot plugins to offer specialized AI-powered tools for your audience. For example, give them a recipe finder. They enter some ingredients, click Mexican Recipes, and a list appears. GPT is doing this searching for you behind the scenes.</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">The AI Engine chatbot is quite popular as it offers content generation, images, forms, and much more. It also includes multiple AI systems. Or, take a look at this one: Tidio – Live Chat &amp; AI Chatbots. Both can be installed in your site’s Plugins &gt; Add New screen. You can f<a id="idTextAnchor010"/>ind other AI plugins here: <a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/5O97">https://mng.bz/5O97</a>.</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">If you’re using the Gutenberg block editor, click Jetpack in your dashboard, and then locate and try Jetpack AI in the Manage Your Jetpack Products screen.</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Websites that include blogs are crying out for a plugin that submits incoming messages to AI for vetting—ensuring that only appropriate, mannerly messages are posted on your site. At the time of this writing, nobody has created one yet.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">These plugins provide essential services and are the best of breed. Of course there are always exceptions. If you’re running a personal blog for family and friends, you clearly don’t need to gather data via MonsterInsights or attempt to climb high in Google or AI search rankings using AIOSEO.</p>
<p class="body">That said, your site will likely need some specialized plugins to assist with tasks needed by your site’s particular purpose. To help you make the best choices, we’ll next consider three things you should look for when picking the best plugins.<a id="idIndexMarker029"/><a id="idIndexMarker030"/><a id="marker-120"/><a id="idIndexMarker031"/></p>

<p class="body-ind">Also, see if a plugin is compatible with the current version of WordPress. WordPress is updated very frequently, often for security reasons. You’d be surprised how many plugins and themes are abandoned by their developers and thus no longer kept compatible. This can pose a security risk to your site.</p>
<p class="fm-calloute"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> There are exceptions to that keeping-updated rule. Some out-of-date plugins are so useful that they can still be worth trusting.

For one thing lots of people are still actively using them. Advanced Editor Tools has millions of active installations, and Easy Google Fonts has 200,000. So even if they suffered a security breach, it’s unlikely that you would be among the first victims. Further, your Wordfence or other security would respond rapidly to block the threat. And finally, you’ve got site backups if the worst happens. On the other hand, an abandoned plugin with 3,000 installations is pretty risky. In that case, find an alternative.<a id="marker-121"/></p>

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_7">5.3 Turn on auto-updating</h2>
<p class="body">Plugins are often updated to improve security, fix bugs, or add features. Plugins active on your site should be updated as soon as an update is made available.

<p class="body-dialog">   5.  You need to update WordPress itself by going to your Dashboard &gt; Updates screen. If there’s a new version available, a banner announcing it appears at the top of the screen with a link you can click to update.</p>
<p class="fm-calloute"><span class="fm-callout-head">Warning</span> Before updating WordPress, it’s always good practice to manually force a backup of the site, just in case anything goes wrong during the update process. If you’re using UpdraftPlus, go to the Settings &gt; UpdraftPlus Backups screen, click the Backup/Restore button, and then click the Backup Now button.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_8">5.4 Avoid adding too many plugins</h2>
<p class="body">While plugins can be very effective and add excellent features to your site, using too many can lead to a variety of problems, including security breaches, bugs, crashes, and slower performance. To avoid these problems, it’s recommended that you only install the plugins you really need. <a id="idIndexMarker036"/><a id="marker-124"/></p>
<p class="body">There is no set rule about the ideal number of plugins. You do want to ensure that you add the functionality that’s necessary for the smooth running of the site, and for the best experience for your site’s visitors. But note that plugin conflicts are a common source of bugs. And the more plugins you use, the more you increase the likelihood of these conflicts.</p>
<p class="body">Plugins can also cause security problems. WordPress allows you to install plugins without activating them. But unless you have a plugin that you frequently turn on and off, you should delete any that aren’t activated. Even though a plugin isn’t being used, it’s still a chunk of code in your site’s database. And programming code can be an entrance for malware, especially if it’s not being updated. (WordPress notifies you if an update is available, even for inactive plugins. And the auto-update feature works with both active and inactive plugins as well.)</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> The difference between <i class="fm-italics">installed</i> and <i class="fm-italics">active</i> can be confusing. Think of a lamp. Installed means it’s plugged in. Active means it’s turned on.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_9">5.5 Preventing plugin conflicts</h2>
<p class="body">When you have something weird happening in your backend—a bug, an oddity—check for plugin conflicts first. WordPress bugs are caused by a variety of sources: theme incompatibility with the core WordPress functionality, hosting service database problems, and other bugs can cause WordPress to misbehave. But <i class="fm-italics">most often</i>, the likely cause of a bug is a conflict between incompatible plugins.<a id="idIndexMarker037"/><a id="idIndexMarker038"/><a id="marker-125"/></p>
<p class="body">Why do plugins cause bugs? Given that there are an estimated 60,000 plus available, clearly no plugin developer can check to see if their plugin is compatible with every other plugin. If something strange and inexplicable <i class="fm-italics">is</i> happening in your WordPress site, your first move should be to follow these steps to see if a plugin is causing the problem:</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   1.  Back up your site, and then activate your Coming Soon plugin to block visitors from accessing the site. If the problem can’t be quickly solved, then work on a copy of your site (called staging) rather than block your audience. Your hosting service might have a staging utility, or you can use the popular BlogVault plugin BlogVault WordPress Backup Plugin (<a class="url" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/blogvault-real-time-backup/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/blogvault-real-time-backup/</a>).<a id="idIndexMarker039"/></p>
<p class="body-dialog">   2.  Go to your Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins screen.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   3.  Click the Plugin checkbox to select all the plugins at once, as shown in figure 5.9.</p>

<p class="body-dialog">   4.  Choose Deactivate from the Bulk Actions list, and then click the Apply button shown in figure 5.10.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figuree"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="443" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH05_F10_Mansfield.png" width="741"/></p>
<p class="figurecaptione">Figure 5.10 Deactivating all of your plugins</p>
</div>
<p class="body">Now you’ve turned all your plugins off. So, return to the bug and see if it’s now fixed. If so, <i class="fm-italics">one</i> of your plugins is the culprit. To find out which one, reactivate them one by one. And each time you activate a plugin, return to the bug. When the bug reappears, the plugin you just activated is the culprit. Uninstall it, and then find an alternative that does the same job.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> Ano<a id="idTextAnchor011"/>ther tactic is to use the free <i class="fm-italics">Health Check &amp; Troubleshooting</i> plugin to test your plugins. It’s created by members of the WordPress open source community to work with the built-in Tools &gt; Site Health feature. Search for, install, and activate that plugin in your Plugins &gt; Add New screen.<a id="marker-126"/><a id="idIndexMarker040"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_10">5.6 Adding Jetpack to your site</h2>
<p class="body">In 2005, WordPress split into two platforms, the paid version (WordPress.<i class="fm-italics">com</i>) and the free open source version I recommend and use in this book’s examples (WordPress.<i class="fm-italics">org</i>). The open source .org version of WordPress however does require that you use create and maintain it on a paid hosting service. (Choose SiteGround, Bluehost, or DreamHost, as recommended by WordPress itself.)<a id="idIndexMarker041"/><a id="idIndexMarker042"/><a id="idIndexMarker043"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Note</span> These “com” and “org” names are used only to identify the two versions of WordPress and have nothing to do with domain extensions (such as .com, .net, and so on) that appear at the end of internet addresses.</p>
<p class="body">WordPress.com includes <i class="fm-italics">Jetpack</i>, a collection of fairly lightweight plugins (called modules as mentioned earlier), and some of them are quite useful. These modules are lightweight because, compared to many other plugins, they don’t offer lots of additional features. But they do get simple jobs done. For example, the Jetpack Form module displays a bare-bones form that a visitor fills out to subscribe to your site, apply for access to your blog, or access other kinds of features. Among other things, a contact form helps you build a list of email addresses from your aud<a id="idTextAnchor012"/>ience.</p>
<p class="body">By contrast, a plugin named Contact Form 7 is a full-featured alternative to the pretty basic Jetpack Form module. But if all you want to do is simply harvest email addresses, the Jetpack plugin works fine. The visitor fills in their information, clicks a Submit button, and the form is emailed to you.</p>
<p class="body">Requiring an email address before a visitor can post messages to your blog is one way of cutting down on spam or other inappropriate messages. To turn on this requirement, go to your Settings &gt; Discussion screen, and check Comment Author Must Fill Out Name and Email.</p>
<p class="body">There is a small drawback to using Jetpack though. Before you can activate it, you have to set up a free account on WordPress.com so you can <i class="fm-italics">link</i> your WordPress.org site to that free account. Only then can you install the Jetpack plugin itself on your .org site.</p>
<p class="body">This free .com account’s site need not be populated with content or otherwise managed. You can just let it sit there and never return to it once you link to it. The WordPress.com system ignores it too, even if it remains inert. Your reward for setting up that free account is the 46 modules you add to your site with Jetpack. (Some Jetpack modules are activated by default; others require that you activate them by hand.)</p>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-127"/>The process of signing up with WordPress.com varies. Your goal is to sign up for the free version. Go to <a class="url" href="https://wordpress.com">https://wordpress.com</a> and click the Get Started button (or whatever name they’ve changed it to). If you already have a .com account, you can skip the process of setting up a new account (so skip down to the next paragraph). During the setup process, you need to pay attention to making the correct choices to establish your <i class="fm-italics">free</i> account—ensure that you choose the correct word <i class="fm-italics">free</i> because sometimes that term is hidden (so scroll down) or several options are displayed using terms like “free to set up” but only one—the truly free one—is unmodified by other words.</p>
<p class="body">After you have your .com account set up, go to your .org site’s backend, and visit your Plugins &gt; Add New screen. Search for, install, and activate Jetpack. Follow Jetpack’s instructions to complete the activation.</p>
<p class="body">Jetpack adds itself to your Admin menu on the left side in your backend. Now, view the Jetpack modules by clicking Jetpack &gt; Dashboard (this is a <i class="fm-italics">second</i> dashboard in your admin menu, as shown in figure 5.11).</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 5.11 Click the Jetpack Dashboard as shown here.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">Now, scroll all the way down to the bottom of Jetpack’s Dashboard screen and click Modules, illustrated here in figure 5.12.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="199" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH05_F12_Mansfield.png" width="800"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 5.12 Buried in the bottom of Jetpack’s dashboard screen is the link to the modules.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">You can look around and see that a handful of the modules are active by default (they are displayed in boldface). If any of Jetpack’s default modules duplicate plugins that you already have and prefer to use, deactivate those modules. Also, you might want to click Popular on the right side. This gives you an idea of what most people are using. Interestingly, not all the modules activated by default when you installed Jetpack are among the most popular ones.</p>
<p class="body">I suggest you consider two modules that exhibit images: <i class="fm-italics">Carousel</i> is a rotating slideshow, and <i class="fm-italics">Tiled Galleries</i> displays several images grouped into various arrangements. Also take a look at these modules: Extra Sidebar Widgets, Widget Visibility, Jetpack Sharing, and Jetpack Social (found in the Jetpack &gt; Social screen). <a id="idIndexMarker044"/><a id="idIndexMarker045"/><a id="idIndexMarker046"/><a id="marker-128"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> The Jetpack Social module differs from the Jetpack Sharing module, though they both involve social media connections. Jetpack Social allows you to automatically share your posts and products to <i class="fm-italics">your</i> social media channels, and it includes scheduling and recycling options. It also has paid plans that offer more features such as video sharing, image generation, and engagement optimization. The Jetpack Sharing module, on the other hand, lets you add sharing buttons to your blog posts for your visitors to use. This gives them a way to easily share your site’s content on <i class="fm-italics">their</i> social media accounts by, for example, clicking a Faceb<a id="idTextAnchor013"/>ook button you added to blog posts.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_11">5.7 Dealing with the EU cookie law</h2>
<p class="body">The<a id="idTextAnchor014"/> European Union cookie law (aka the EU ePrivacy Directive or the Cookie Directive) was introduced in 2011. Its main purpose is to protect the privacy of internet users by requiring website owners to get consent from their visitors before storing cookies on the visitors’ devices. <i class="fm-italics">Cookies</i> are small text files saved on a user’s computer and can be used to track their activity on a website, personalize their experience, and collect data for advertising or other purposes. In practice, the enforcement of the EU Cookie Law varies between EU member countries because each country has included the directive differently in its national law. <a id="idIndexMarker047"/><a id="idIndexMarker048"/><a id="idIndexMarker049"/></p>
<p class="body"><a id="idTextAnchor015"/>In 2018, the EU updated the law with a General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It strengthened the rules for obtaining consent from site visitors and increased the penalties for noncompliance. Currently, EU lawmakers are cooking up a third update to make further changes to the existing directive. They’re lawmakers. It’s their thing.<a id="idIndexMarker050"/></p>
<p class="body">Some countries, such as Canada and Australia, have similar laws in place. In the United States, there is currently no federal cookie law, but tireless lawmakers in some states have passed their own laws.</p>
<p class="body">How should you deal with this? If you’re running a personal blog, intended for local consumption only, or if your site is just for your students, friends, or relatives, you likely don’t need to store cookies anyway. But if your site does use cookies, it would be polite to let your visitors know what information you’re storing and how it’s being used. Some people care.</p>
<p class="body">Some themes—Avada for instance—include a cookie law feature that you can enable. But t<a id="idTextAnchor016"/>here are also plugins. Here are three:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_12">5.8 Ensuring accessibility</h2>
<p class="body">The CDC says one in four Americans experiences some type of disability. It’s wrong to assume that website-related disability refers only to people challenged by full blindness. Other conditions that may challenge your visitors include partial vision, auditory problems, color blindness, cognitive challenges, and neurological or sensory problems. For example, people with cognitive impairments such as dementia, autism, or traumatic brain injury may have trouble dealing with layout, design, and navigability. And a crowded layout or small buttons and links can cause difficulties for people with limited use of their hands.<a id="idIndexMarker051"/><a id="idIndexMarker052"/><a id="marker-129"/></p>
<p class="body">So, a large portion of your audience likely will appreciate you taking their needs into account. And there’s nothing to prevent you from ensuring that your site is accessible to <i class="fm-italics">all</i> visitors. Here are some things to check or put in place:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Does your typeface color strongly contrast against the background for ease of readability? Visit the WebAIM site for a useful Contrast Checker test: <a class="url" href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</a>.</p>

<p class="list">When you embed a YouTube video, add captions to it for the hearing impaired. (When adding video to your site, it’s best to upload the video to YouTube and then <i class="fm-italics">embed</i> the video in one of your site’s pages. This technique is explained in an upcoming chapter.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">
<p class="fm-sidebar-title">How to add captions to an embedded video</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">You have to create an embed ID code. Here’s what one looks like:<a id="marker-130"/><a id="idIndexMarker053"/><a id="idIndexMarker054"/></p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube

frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</pre>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">You need to get an embed ID. So, first find in YouTube the video you want to embed into your site. Run the video and click the Share option. Click Embed, and then click Copy. This ID is illustrated in the following figure.</p>
<p class="sidebarafigures"><img alt="" class="calibre2" height="457" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH05_F12_UN01_Mansfield.png" width="550"/></p>
<p class="sidebaracaptions">In this example, you click the &lt;&gt; Embed icon, and then you’ll be shown the code you can copy.</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Then, in the Edit Page screen where you want to embed the video, click the Text tab in the upper-right corner of the text box, and paste the following code:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube
.com/embed/VIDEOIDGOESHERE?cc_load_policy=1"
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</pre>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">But replace <code class="fm-code-in-text">VIDEOIDGOESHERE</code> with <code class="fm-code-in-text">x3mXMIgvyJU</code> (or whatever video ID you’re using).</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Click the Publish or Update button to save the page. Then you can look at the page from the frontend as a visitor would see it. And you can see that captions have been added to your embedded video.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">Because it’s not easy to automate site accessibility, you’ll find only a few plugins that attempt the job. And some of these plugins have even raised legal problems (not fixing all the problems or inadequate compliance, thereby potentially exposing you to legal challenges). So, manually ensuring accessibility is recommended. For one thing, you can tweak your site by hand fairly quickly to fix any bad typography problems. And remember to fill in the Alt Text field when adding images to your pages.</p>
<p class="body">One helpful tool for making your site available to all is an accessibility checker. Here are three for you to consider:</p>

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_13">5.9 Adding a sidebar</h2>
<p class="body"><i class="fm-italics">Widgets</i> are similar to plugins, but are usually smaller and offer more limited functionality. Widgets are placed into a site’s <i class="fm-italics">sidebar</i>, which is a usually narrow strip of content containing one or more widgets (such as a small text box displaying a store address, hours, and phone number).<a id="idIndexMarker060"/><a id="idIndexMarker061"/><a id="marker-131"/></p>
<p class="body">A sidebar is an important element of many sites. Like the menu, a sidebar appears on each page unless you turn it off for certain pages, usually because it would be redundant. You can use the Widget Visibility module in Jetpack to select which pages will display which widgets.</p>
<p class="body">On a sidebar, you put content that deserves to be visible most everywhere within your site. A sidebar can contain various kinds of content. Figure 5.13 illustrates a restaurant website’s home page, with featured menu items on a right-side sidebar.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="678" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH05_F13_Mansfield.png" width="800"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 5.13 A sidebar can contain specialized content, such as this restaurant’s currently featured menu items.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">A sidebar often contains subsidiary content stacked in a narrow, usually vertical, column. A sidebar takes up perhaps only a fifth the width of the primary content. Its narrowness is why it contains widgets with their more limited functionality when compared to plugins.</p>
<p class="body">So, it’s a thin strip of real estate on which site designers can display a clickable map that expands to display your store location, a clickable events calendar, or perhaps a couple of sample blog posts or testimonials.</p>
<p class="body">Your theme determines how many types and locations of sidebars are available. Look in your Appearance &gt; Widgets screen. They can be on the left, right, or below the main content. Also, in some cases, a sidebar displays the site menu.</p>
<p class="body">Let’s try adding a widget to a sidebar using WordPress’s Twenty Sixteen theme. Follow these steps:</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   1.  Go to your Plugins &gt; Add New screen and search for the <code class="fm-code-in-text">Classic Widgets</code> plugin (the one with 2 million installations). Install and activate it. Without this plugin, you have to use the Gutenberg version of the sidebar management system.<a id="idIndexMarker062"/><a id="marker-132"/></p>
<p class="body-dialog">   2.  Go to the Appearance &gt; Widgets screen. Displayed there is a list of default widgets and some Jetpack widgets as well, as shown in figure 5.14.</p>

<p class="fm-sidebar-title">Understanding website languages</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">The language of HTML primarily focuses on design (describing how the web page looks—mostly in terms of its structure, its layout). And the CSS language works with HTML, refining the HTML design (but also including special effects such as transitions and animation). JavaScript is a language that describes <i class="fm-italics">behavior</i>. For example, you use <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;script&gt;</code> to tell the browser what steps to take when a button is clicked. JavaScript (like HTML) usually runs in the browser, so it can do things without needing to refresh the page. Like displaying an extra block of text. As you saw in the previous example code, you can insert JavaScript code within HTML using the <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. <a id="idIndexMarker068"/><a id="idIndexMarker069"/><a id="idIndexMarker070"/><a id="marker-137"/><a id="idIndexMarker071"/></p>

<p class="body">But let’s get back to programming. So, if you wanted to learn to program (in pretty much any computer language), you could learn from AI, which is a very considerate and quite talented tutor. You could ask it to quiz you, give you assignments, even (currently with Claude) create a 70,000-word course on CSS, complete with reviews, multiple-choice tests, and 12 lessons.</p>
<p class="body">However, I would discourage you from studying programming, for the same reasons that I would try to dissuade you from enrolling in horse-drawn carriage-making classes. AI is already better at programming than most of us.</p>
