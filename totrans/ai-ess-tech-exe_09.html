<h1><span class="label">Chapter 9. </span>Build or Buy?</h1>

<p>This age-old question applies just as much to AI as it does to
traditional tech: <em>Should we build it, or should we buy it?</em></p>
<p>The decision hinges on whether the capability is part of your core
skills or future products. If it is, build it. If not, buy it. When
you’ve decided that buying is the right choice, finding the right tool
is your next step.</p>

<h1>Finding AI Tools</h1>
<p>Recently, we were working with a client who wanted to create
automated data analysis to speed up debugging. Because this was only
going to be used by the team instead of customers, we suggested they
look at AI-powered data analysis tools like <a href="https://hex.tech">Hex</a> and <a href="https://julius.ai">Julius</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, data analysis is just one area of emerging AI tools for
your business. To help you discover more, Greg developed the aptly-named
<a href="https://www.gregslist.ai">Greg’s List</a>, which you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig0901">Figure 9-1</a>.</p>

<p>This curated site has a list of AI tools for a wide variety of areas
including HR, legal, and finance—just to name a few. There are many
tools out there that will benefit your business, but don’t forget about
looking into tools that will help you personally.</p>

<h1>The Importance of Daily AI Use</h1>
<p>As an executive, it’s vital that you integrate AI into your daily
workflow. Regular use helps you grasp AI’s real-world benefits and
limitations, in turn informing your strategic decisions for applying it
in your business. It’s also a great way to inspire ideas for adding new
AI features to your products. You’ve hopefully been using ChatGPT and
Claude already, but here are a few other AI tools that we’ve found
particularly useful:</p>

meeting transcription and summarization</dd>
<dt><a href="https://hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway Editor Plus</a></dt><dd>A writing
assistant we use for more effective business <span class="keep-together">communications</span></dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.descript.com">Descript</a></dt><dd>Makes video
editing as simple as editing text</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.cursor.com">Cursor</a></dt><dd>Versatile developer
tool with surprising benefits for non-technical users</dd>
</dl>
<p>As an action step, choose one tool to integrate into your daily
workflow this week. Set a goal to use AI in at least five different ways
each day. This could be drafting emails, taking notes, or even personal
tasks like meal planning.</p>
<p>Share your experiences with your team, and encourage a culture of AI
adoption and experimentation.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>If a capability isn’t part of your core skills or future products,
consider buying it instead of building it. You don’t need to become a
tech expert, but by identifying opportunities for tools to save you time
and improve your workflows, you’ll be better positioned to lead your
organization in the AI space.</p>
