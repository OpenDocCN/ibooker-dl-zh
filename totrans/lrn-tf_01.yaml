- en: From large corporations to budding startups, engineers and data scientists are
    collecting huge amounts of data and using machine learning algorithms to answer
    complex questions and build intelligent systems. Wherever one looks in this landscape,
    the class of algorithms associated with deep learning have recently seen great
    success, often leaving traditional methods in the dust. Deep learning is used
    today to understand the content of images, natural language, and speech, in systems
    ranging from mobile apps to autonomous vehicles. Developments in this field are
    taking place at breakneck speed, with deep learning being extended to other domains
    and types of data, like complex chemical and genetic structures for drug discovery
    and high-dimensional medical records in public healthcare.

- en: Deep learning methods—which also go by the name of deep neural networks—were
    originally roughly inspired by the human brain’s vast network of interconnected
    neurons. In deep learning, we feed millions of data instances into a network of
    neurons, teaching them to recognize patterns from raw inputs. The deep neural
    networks take raw inputs (such as pixel values in an image) and transform them
    into useful representations, extracting higher-level features (such as shapes
    and edges in images) that capture complex concepts by combining smaller and smaller
    pieces of information to solve challenging tasks such as image classification ([Figure 1-1](#image_classification_with_deep_neural_nets)).
    The networks automatically learn to build abstract representations by adapting
    and correcting themselves, fitting patterns observed in the data. The ability
    to automatically construct data representations is a key advantage of deep neural
    nets over conventional machine learning, which typically requires domain expertise
    and manual feature engineering before any “learning” can occur.

    fundamental task in computer vision is image classification—building algorithms
    and systems that receive images as input, and return a set of categories that
    best describe them. Researchers, data scientists, and engineers have designed
    advanced deep neural networks that obtain highly accurate results in understanding
    visual content. These deep networks are typically trained on large amounts of
    image data, taking much time, resources, and effort. However, in a growing trend,
    researchers are publicly releasing pre-trained models—deep neural nets that are
    already trained and that users can download and apply to their data ([Figure 1-2](#adv_computer_vision)).

    tensors are just multidimensional arrays, an extension of two-dimensional tables
    (matrices) to data with higher dimensionality. Just as a black-and-white (grayscale)
    images are represented as “tables” of pixel values, RGB images are represented
    as tensors (three-dimensional arrays), with each pixel having three values corresponding
    to red, green, and blue components.

    Broadly speaking, in this graph, nodes represent operations (such as addition
    or multiplication), and edges represent data (tensors) flowing around the system.
    In the next chapters, we will dive deeper into these concepts and learn to understand
    them with many examples.

    graphs to be executed across a wide variety of environments and hardware platforms.
    With essentially identical code, the same TensorFlow neural net could, for instance,
    be trained in the cloud, distributed over a cluster of many machines or on a single
    laptop. It can be deployed for serving predictions on a dedicated server or on
    mobile device platforms such as Android or iOS, or Raspberry Pi single-board computers.
    TensorFlow is also compatible, of course, with Linux, macOS, and Windows operating
    systems.

- en: Aside from its portability, another key aspect of TensorFlow is its flexibility,
    allowing researchers and data scientists to express models with relative ease.
    It is sometimes revealing to think of modern deep learning research and practice
    as playing with “LEGO-like” bricks, replacing blocks of the network with others
    and seeing what happens, and at times designing new blocks. As we shall see throughout
    this book, TensorFlow provides helpful tools to use these modular blocks, combined
    with a flexible API that enables the writing of new ones. In deep learning, networks
    are trained with a feedback process called backpropagation based on gradient descent
    optimization. TensorFlow flexibly supports many optimization algorithms, all with
    automatic differentiation—the user does not need to specify any gradients in advance,
    since TensorFlow derives them automatically based on the computation graph and
    loss function provided by the user. To monitor, debug, and visualize the training
    process, and to streamline experiments, TensorFlow comes with TensorBoard ([Figure 1-6](#fig0106)),
    a simple visualization tool that runs in the browser, which we will use throughout
    this book.

- en: Key enablers of TensorFlow’s flexibility for data scientists and researchers
    are high-level abstraction libraries. In state-of-the-art deep neural nets for
    computer vision or NLU, writing TensorFlow code can take a toll—it can become
    a complex, lengthy, and cumbersome endeavor. Abstraction libraries such as Keras
    and TF-Slim offer simplified high-level access to the “LEGO bricks” in the lower-level
    library, helping to streamline the construction of the dataflow graphs, training
    them, and running inference. Another key enabler for data scientists and engineers
    is the pretrained models that come with TF-Slim and TensorFlow. These models were
    trained on massive amounts of data with great computational resources, which are
    often hard to come by and in any case require much effort to acquire and set up.
    Using Keras or TF-Slim, for example, with just a few lines of code it is possible
    to use these advanced models for inference on incoming data, and also to fine-tune
    the models to adapt to new data.

    It has natural support for distributed training—indeed, it is used at Google and
    other large industry players to train massive networks on huge amounts of data,
    over clusters of many machines. In local implementations, training on multiple
    hardware devices requires few changes to code used for single devices. Code also
    remains relatively unchanged when going from local to distributed, which makes
    using TensorFlow in the cloud, on Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud, particularly
    attractive. Additionally, as we will see further along in this book, TensorFlow
    comes with many more features aimed at boosting scalability. These include support
    for asynchronous computation with threading and queues, efficient I/O and data
