    comprising the language model vocabulary don’t entirely look like English language
    words that appear in a dictionary. These word-like units are called “types,” and
    the instantiation of a type (when it appears in a sequence of text) is called
    a token.

    except in older NLP textbooks. The term “token” is broadly used to refer to both
    the vocabulary units and when they appear in a text sequence. We will henceforth
    use the word “token” to describe both concepts, even though I personally am not
    the biggest fan of this usage.

    tokens are all single-character tokens, such as special characters, digits, capital
    letters, small letters, and accented characters. Longer words appear later on
    in the vocabulary. A lot of tokens correspond to just a part of a word, called
    a *subword*, like “impl,” “inated,” and so on.

    on such a huge body of text such that most tokens are seen by the model enough
    times to learn distinctive representations for them. For instance, there is a
    definite semantic difference between “web” and “Web,” and it is good to have separate
    tokens for them.

    It is impractical to give every number its own token, especially if you want to
    limit your vocabulary size to say, just 50,000\. Later in this chapter, we will
    discuss how vocabulary sizes are determined. Popular names and places get their
    own token. There is a token representing Boston, Toronto, and Amsterdam, but none
    representing Mesa or Chennai. There is a token representing Ahmed and Donald,

    “understandable”), multiple words can be combined into a single word, and so on.

    vocabulary. All OOV tokens share the same embedding (and encode the same meaning),

- en: To solve the OOV problem, one possible solution could be to represent tokens
    in terms of characters instead of words. Each character has its own embedding,
    and as long as all valid characters are included in the vocabulary, there will
    never be a chance of encountering an OOV token. However, there are many downsides
    to this. The number of tokens needed to represent the average sentence becomes
    much larger. For example, the sentence, “The number of tokens needed to represent
    the average sentence becomes much larger,” contains 13 tokens when you treat each
    word as a token, but 81 tokens when you treat each character as a token. This
    reduces the amount of content you can represent within a fixed sequence length,
    which makes both model training and inference slower, as we will show further
    in [Chapter 4](ch04.html#chapter_transformer-architecture). Models support a limited
    sequence length, so this also reduces the amount of content you can fit in a single
    prompt. Later in this chapter, we will discuss models like CANINE, ByT5, and Charformer
    that attempt to use character-based tokens.

    field hasn’t come to a consensus yet) is using subwords. Subwords are the predominant
    mode of representing vocabulary units in the language model space today. The GPT-NeoX
    vocabulary we explored earlier uses subword tokens. [Figure 3-1](#subword-tokens)
    shows the OpenAI tokenizer playground that demonstrates how words are split into
    their constituent subwords by OpenAI models.

    typos. But at least the OOV problem has been dealt with by breaking the words
    into subwords. The vocabulary also doesn’t seem to have an entry for the word
    “corduroy,” thus confirming its poor sense of fashion. Meanwhile, note that there
    is a distinct token for three contiguous exclamation points, which is different
    from the token that represents a single exclamation point. Semantically, they
    do convey slightly different meanings.    ###### Note    Very large models trained
    on a massive body of text are more robust to misspellings. A lot of misspellings
    already occur in the training set. For example, even the rare misspelling “Insuffienct”
    occurs 14 times in the C4 pre-training dataset. The more common misspelling “insufficent”
    occurs over 1,100 times. Larger models can also infer the misspelled word from
    its context. Smaller models like BERT are quite sensitive to misspellings.    If
    you are using models from OpenAI, you can explore their tokenization scheme using
    the [tiktoken library](https://oreil.ly/2QByi) (no relation to the social media

    pipeline](assets/dllm_0303.png)  ###### Figure 3-3\. Hugging Face tokenizers pipeline    If
    you are using the `tokenizers` library from Hugging Face, your input text is run
    through a [multistage tokenization pipeline](https://oreil.ly/CcOKV). This pipeline
    is composed of four components:    *   Normalization           *   Pre-tokenization           *   Tokenization           *   Postprocessing              Note
    that different models will execute different steps within these four components.    ##
    Normalization    Different types of normalization applied include:    *   Converting
    text to lowercase (if you are using an uncased model)           *   Stripping
    off accents from characters, like from the word Peña           *   Unicode normalization              Let’s
    see what kind of normalization is applied on the uncased version of BERT:    [PRE18]py    The
    output is:    [PRE19]py    As we can see, the accents have been removed and the
    text has been converted to lowercase.    There isn’t much normalization done in
    tokenizers for more recent models.    ## Pre-Tokenization    Before we run the
    tokenizer on the text, we can optionally perform a pre-tokenization step. As mentioned
    earlier, most tokenizers today employ subword tokenization. A common step is to
    first perform word tokenization and then feed the output of it to the subword
    tokenization algorithm. This step is called pre-tokenization.    Pre-tokenization
    is a relatively easy step in English compared to many other languages, since you
    can start with a very strong baseline just by splitting text on whitespace. There
    are outlier decisions to be made, such as how to deal with punctuation, multiple
    spaces, numbers, etc. In Hugging Face the regular expression:    [PRE20]py    is
    used to split on whitespace.    Let’s run the pre-tokenization step of the T5
