  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many consider WP Rocket to be the best all-around, full-service performance
    plugin. Its primary function is to maximize site performance (such as speeding
    up page display) using various optimizations. Among other strategies, WP Rocket
    offers efficient *caching*. That said, you might want to check with your hosting
    service. Some hosts don’t want you to add caching plugins to your site because
    they perform caching on their end. Also, if you run into an unexplained bug on
    your site, try disabling your caching plugin to see if the bug goes away. Caching
    plugins are one of the main causes of plugin conflicts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Definition *Caching* means storing whole pages, so the browser doesn’t have
    to redraw a page the next time it’s viewed. If cached, a page can just be slapped
    into the visitor’s browser window, no processing required. In addition to the
    text or media, a web page includes hidden HTML and CSS codes that describe things
    such as layout, headline sizes, font color, and so on. Without caching, each page—even
    if nothing has been changed in it—must be re-rendered before it’s displayed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to caching web pages, WP Rocket also employs other types of caching.
    It offers cache *preloading* (anticipating, then rendering in advance, what page
    you’re most likely to view next). It also compresses. One type of compression
    is called *code minification*—it removes unneeded characters (such as programmer
    comments and whitespace). For one example, instead of storing five blank lines,
    it stores only three characters `5bl` (this *describes* the number of blank lines
    rather than actually storing a mirror image of all the characters in all the lines).
    This tactic makes code files smaller, so they load more quickly and require less
    bandwidth to transmit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Similarly, WP Rocket *concatenates* your site’s page files—combining multiple
    code files into a single file. If not concatenated, to render a page, the browser
    must make multiple individual requests to your site’s database (stored on your
    hosting service’s drives)—one request for each file of the several that make up
    the page. If the files are merged, only one request is needed, and the result
    is faster load times and improved overall site performance. It’s similar to the
    difference between researching via Google and asking GPT a question. Google gives
    you a list of several results that you then must look at individually and sometimes
    merge into a final answer. GPT does that for you: displaying a single, finished
    answer to your question.'

    Some of these plugins you can ignore. They provide no added value because you
    can just as easily visit an AI system’s website directly to get the same results.
    For example, there’s no need to install an AI plugin to help you choose your site’s
    title. Just submit a prompt for a list of titles for your site’s topic to an AI
    assistant website such as Claude ([https://claude.ai](https://claude.ai)). (And
    while you’re at it, ask Claude to ensure that none of the titles it suggests are

    are so useful that they can still be worth trusting. Easy Google Fonts and Advanced

    So why feel safe with them? For one thing lots of people are still actively using
    them. Advanced Editor Tools has millions of active installations, and Easy Google
    Fonts has 200,000\. So even if they suffered a security breach, it’s unlikely
    that you would be among the first victims. Further, your Wordfence or other security
    would respond rapidly to block the threat. And finally, you’ve got site backups

    code can be an entrance for malware, especially if it’s not being updated. (WordPress

    (called modules as mentioned earlier), and some of them are quite useful. These
    modules are lightweight because, compared to many other plugins, they don’t offer
    lots of additional features. But they do get simple jobs done. For example, the
    Jetpack Form module displays a bare-bones form that a visitor fills out to subscribe
    to your site, apply for access to your blog, or access other kinds of features.
    Among other things, a contact form helps you build a list of email addresses from
    your audience.

    the pretty basic Jetpack Form module. But if all you want to do is simply harvest

    clicks a Submit button, and the form is emailed to you.

    on your .org site.

    for setting up that free account is the 46 modules you add to your site with Jetpack.

    them by hand.)

    already have a .com account, you can skip the process of setting up a new account

    attention to making the correct choices to establish your *free* account—ensure

    More complex plugins cause AI to struggle. And that can require your intervention

    of a form your visitors fill out.) But given AI’s speed of self-improvement, give
    it a few months—who knows how much more sophisticated its plugins will become?

- en: The language of HTML primarily focuses on design (describing how the web page
    looks—mostly in terms of its structure, its layout). And the CSS language works
    with HTML, refining the HTML design (but also including special effects such as
    transitions and animation). JavaScript is a language that describes *behavior*.
    For example, you use `<script>` to tell the browser what steps to take when a
    button is clicked. JavaScript (like HTML) usually runs in the browser, so it can
    do things without needing to refresh the page. Like displaying an extra block
    of text. As you saw in the previous example code, you can insert JavaScript code
    within HTML using the `<script>` tag.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another website language, PHP, also frequently governs behavior, but it runs
    server-side (in the cloud on your hosting service’s drives). Several other programing
    languages can also be employed server-side to control website behaviors.
