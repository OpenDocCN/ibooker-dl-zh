    up and leave. Fix this. Eliminate the problem. And subsequent analysis will quickly

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Page views refers to the total number of times a page on a website is viewed
    or reloaded by visitors. Each load or reload counts as a page view, even if one
    visitor repeatedly revisits a particular page. (A browser page refresh—F5—also
    usually counts as a view. Some analytics platforms do have settings or filters
    to exclude duplicate page views generated by quick refreshes.) This tells you
    the comparative popularity of your various pages. And looking at how page view
    numbers change over time tells you whether your site’s audience is growing or
    shrinking. This doesn’t, however, let you know how many unique visitors are viewing
    the pages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 12.2.2 Unique visitors
  prefs:

    computer, whatever—visits your site within a defined time period. And importantly,
    even if someone visits your site many times during that period, they only get
    counted once.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do analytics systems know if the same visitor comes more than once? Cookies
    are saved in the visitor’s browser to store the IP address of their device. IP
    addresses are a unique identifier of each device. From this metric, you learn
    your audience’s true size. It also tells you how many visitors are new and how
    many are returning. This way, you can see your retention rate too.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The bounce rate describes the percentage of people who leave without going past
    the home page. As you know, your home page is the first impression people will
    have. It must be inviting, trustworthy (testimonials), and efficient (intuitive
    navigation), and it must clearly announce your site’s purpose. Ultra clarity is
    essential (ensure that your headline and main image immediately make obvious the
    purpose and value of the site). And make certain that your pages load rapidly.
    Test your page load speed at PageSpeed Insights ([https://mng.bz/dXxz](https://mng.bz/dXxz)).
    Remember that many potential visitors around the world will likely have slower
    internet connections than you do.

    title like *Lazy Afternoons* or *Whispering Windchimes.* Nobody knows what these
    titles mean! As the British say, they are *too clever by half.* Instead, plainly
    state in the title what your site is about: Bass Fishing in North Carolina’s Randleman
    Lake. People don’t visit your front page to solve a puzzle. They want to know
    instantly if your site is where they should be.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The bounce rate tells you how many people don’t click links, visit other pages,
    click a menu item, or trigger any other events in the site that the analytics
    system is tracking. You learn whether your home page effectively provides clear,
    useful, relevant information. It must lure them into your site. Does the home
    page load slowly or have broken links? Is your site title and tagline misleading,
    confusing, or vague? Is the design or content simply not what the visitors are
    looking for?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s also thought that bounce rate can affect AIO and SEO, given that if people
    quickly flee, that can signal that your site isn’t relevant or valuable. However,
    this isn’t considered a major AIO/SEO factor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The average bounce rate is 50% and usually ranges from 40% to 60%. Blogs, however,
    are unique because they display a collection of messages, and many people might
    be happy with your offering, but read only one or two messages. They then never
    go beyond the home page and are counted as a bounce. Even though 50% is an average,
    bounce rates can vary significantly in different types of sites, topics, and industries.
    It’s best to compare your site’s bounce rate to other sites in your category.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interior page bounce rates can also be part of an analytics package. And, you
    need to interpret this data based on the page’s purpose. Some pages can have a
    high bounce rate merely because they contain little content or are the target
    of your CTA, so visitors are expected to exit from that page and go nowhere else
    in the site. They’ve filled out the form or made the purchase. Obviously, a shopping
    site’s purchase summary (Place Order button) is one such page. Bounce rates are
    irrelevant on the last page of your CTA because the visitor has “converted” into
    a lead (given you their email address, for example) or become a customer.

    remain on your site during their sessions. This is an indication of how much visitors
    value your site. This average is calculated by adding all the durations between
    all the visitors’ entrances and exits, and then dividing this total by the number
    of visitors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If people leave quickly, you might want to look at your design, content quality,
    navigation efficiency, or page load speeds. As with most of these metrics, don’t
    look at duration in isolation. Perhaps a visitor lingered because they were confused
    about how to find what they came for. Several other metrics also measure engagement,
    so take them into account as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some analytics programs use different terminology, such as *time on site*. Individual
    page duration is also measurable, but how long visitors stay on the last page
    viewed when they leave the site can’t be measured. This is because durations are
    calculated by subtracting the time of a prior page load event from the subsequent
    one. And when they leave, there will be no subsequent page load event inside your
    site. Or if someone goes out for dinner or otherwise leaves the computer inactive,
    the analytic system will close the session after 30 minutes of inactivity. (That’s
    the Google Analytics default, but you can customize it.)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How many people complete your desired goal, such as giving you their email address,
    signing up for your newsletter, buying something, or otherwise responding to your
    CTA? This is an important metric, providing you with the percentage of your visitors
    who are converted, and thus the *effectiveness* of your site. The conversion rate
    is calculated by dividing the total number of visitors by the total number of
    conversions, and then multiplying by 100\. For example, if an e-commerce site
    has 3,000 visitors, and 100 of them buy something, the conversion rate is (100
    ÷ 3000) × 100 = 3.3%.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s thought that the conversion rate is usually the single best measure of
    site performance, particularly for sites designed to achieve a business or professional
    purpose (as opposed to sites such as personal blogs). A high rate means that your
    site’s design and content are performing well. A low rate means there is work
    to be done to improve one or more elements of the site. You try different tactics,
    modifications, and CTAs and watch what happens to your rate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do remember, however, that conversion rates vary significantly for different
    businesses and industries. The average across the board is estimated to be between
    2.35% and 5.31%. But the conversion rate is most useful as a way for you to see
    trends in *your* site’s performance over time as you make adjustments.

    explorations) tell you how visitors traverse your site—their pathway within or
    among your site’s pages. (Some analytics applications can track intrapage movements
    such as local links or scrolling.) This data can identify where users abandon
    or hesitate when arriving at your CTA, locations where nobody ever goes, navigation
    issues (Do people get stuck in a particular place? Or get caught in a loop?),
    exit the site while making a purchase, and so on.

    These differ from simpler, traditional AI assistance in several key ways:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI agents are goal oriented. They perform complete tasks, rather than just responding
    to a prompt with information. For example, instead of reading some of your text
    content that you pasted into a prompt, an agent could actually *visit* your site.
    When finished experiencing your site as a human would, AI can judge more abstract
    qualities such as the interrelationships *between* your design, media, and text
    content. AI can critique site structure by looking at the navigation paths, and
    judge global issues like whether the entire site holds together organically (visually,
    writing style, redundancy, and so on). GPT-4o and greater can visit and scan sites,
    as described in chapter 11, section 11.2.2.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI agents can use chain-of-thought reasoning to figure out on their own what
    steps to take to reach a goal—even a complex, multistep goal—without further prompting
    or assistance from you. In other words, they can behave autonomously and proactively.
    They are let loose into the real world.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your prompting can be simpler. For example, if you merely tell an agent to suggest
    improvements to your site, it could make its own decisions about how to do that.
    It might visit multiple competing sites without your telling it to, so it can
    compare your site to its competitors. It might check for visual appeal or plagiarism
    without being asked to do those things. Agents are self-starters and provide intelligent
    feedback on their own. AI agents can autonomously create subgoals, intermediate
    steps, without requiring human guidance. Your prompts can be short because all
    you need to do is describe a goal, and the AI will figure what it needs to do
    to reach that goal. Agents can also learn from the environment. Ultimately, they’ll
    be able to use sensors and learn from all types of real-world input. Watch movies.
    Listen to Mozart or Muse. Just like us. OpenAI took a big step in this direction
    with the release of GPT-4o in spring 2024\. It accepts multimodal input and provides
    multimodal output (except for music and video, currently).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI agents are a more advanced and autonomous form of AI, with the ability to
    reason, learn, change course, traverse the internet, and make independent decisions.
    They don’t need a script to follow or multiple prompts from you. This makes them
    flexible, adapting to changes on the fly, and tackling the unpredictable and sometimes
    complicated nature of real-world situations. High human intelligence is sometimes
    described as primarily *adaptability*. In this way, AI agency is a step in the
    direction of artificial general intelligence (AGI).
  prefs: []

- en: 'When programming a computer, you can make a program’s behavior somewhat adaptable
    by using If/Then and Do/While statements. Similarly, when prompting AI in the
    traditional way, you can make it somewhat adaptable by specifying what to do if
    a decision must be made and how many times to repeat the behavior: “Write a love
    poem. If it doesn’t feel quite right, then provide five revised versions using
    different styles.” Then traditional AI responses display the five versions, and
    you must pick the best one. And this kind of predictive rule setting can’t take
    into account every possible decision that needs to be made.'

    which one is best. In this way, we humans become no longer necessary. When full
    AI agency arrives—likely in 2025—the part we’ll play is to simply express our
    wishes. Then AI does the job. This will continue to be our interrelationship with
    AI as long as it permits.

    website analytics metrics that provide valuable insights into your site’s performance
    and effectiveness.Unique VisitorsUnique Visitors refers to the number of new,
    unduplicated visitors to your website over a given period of time. This metric
    helps you understand the reach and growth of your site, as it excludes repeat
    visitors. By tracking Unique Visitors, you can gauge how successful your marketing
    and content strategies are at attracting new audiences. A steady increase in Unique
    Visitors indicates that your site is expanding its reach and resonating with more
    people. This data can inform decisions around content creation, advertising campaigns,
    and other growth initiatives.Bounce RateBounce Rate is the percentage of visitors
    who go away from your website after viewing only the home page (or a single interior
    page). A high Bounce Rate can mean there are issues with your site’s content,
    design, or user experience. Conversely, a low Bounce Rate suggests that visitors
    are engaged and exploring your site further. By analyzing Bounce Rate, you can
    identify pages or entry points that are failing to capture visitor interest and
    make improvements to enhance engagement. This data is an indicator of how effectively
    your website is retaining and converting visitors.Conversion RateConversion Rate
    measures the percentage of visitors who complete your call to action, such as
    buying something. This metric shows the effectiveness of your site in achieving
    your business goals. A high Conversion Rate indicates that your website is successfully
    guiding visitors through the sales funnel or conversion process. By monitoring
    Conversion Rate, you can assess the performance of your calls to action, landing
    pages, and overall user experience, and make informed modifications to get the
    best results.ConclusionTogether, Unique Visitors, Bounce Rate, and Conversion
    Rate provide a comprehensive view of your website’s performance, helping you understand
    your audience, identify areas that need work, and reveal the success of your site.
    By closely tracking and analyzing these key metrics, you can make solid decisions
    that will result in the best user engagement, drive more conversions, and ultimately,
    achieve your business objectives. |'

    (and Edge) extension called ChatHub ([https://chathub.gg](https://chathub.gg)).
    It allows you to provide a single prompt and see the response from two to as many
    as six AIs simultaneously! This simplifies the job of fact-checking and also allows
    you to quickly choose the best response from multiple AIs. Figure 12.2 shows ChatHub
    in action.

    an audience for a website. We looked at various elements of analytics, such as
    page views, unique visitors, bounce rate, and conversion rate. The chapter emphasized
    the value of tracking user behavior and how AI revolutionizes analytics by providing
    deep data mining and the resulting insights no human could discover. We compared
    four popular WordPress analytics plugins: MonsterInsights, Google Site Kit, Google
    Analytics, and Crazy Egg, highlighting their features and benefits. Finally, we
    saw how AI agents and employing multiple AIs could offer valuable feedback as
    well.'

    *analytics*—the process of collecting, measuring, analyzing, and then providing
    to us human site designers very valuable information. This data can help you greatly
    improve your site. You’re told in detail what your visitors are like and how they’re
    interacting with your site.

    of your site’s CTA. Whether you want them to subscribe to your newsletter, download
    digital content, give you their email address, or just buy something—this funnel
    is how you can move them from your home page to where they take action you want
    them to take.

    are not capable of. It employs deep learning techniques (a powerful form of AI)
    to uncover complex, hidden patterns and relationships within a massive collection

    Site Kit, Google Analytics, and Crazy Egg. The first two are designed to simplify
    using the third because Google Analytics is vast, powerful, and, consequently,
    complex. MonsterInsights and Site Kit tame the Google beast and make understanding
    the data and metrics much easier. The fourth recommended plugin, Crazy Egg, offers
    unique and significant feedback via visualizations. You’ll *see* the data rather
    than read it.'

    too granular. Sometimes, you’ll want a global, overall critique of your site,
    as if an expert human critic summarized your strengths and weaknesses. You’ll
    want to employ the new, emerging AI *agents*. They’re a more advanced and autonomous
    form of AI, with the ability to reason, learn, change course, traverse the internet,
    and make independent decisions *on their own*. You merely give them a goal (“provide
    an in-depth critique of my site”), and they figure out how best to achieve that
    goal.
