  <div class="readable-text" id="p7"> 
   <p>The term “opt out” refers to a user attempting to exit a virtual agent experience, often with the intention of reaching a human agent. You might also see this described as <em>escalating</em> or <em>zeroing out</em> (pushing zero on a phone’s dial pad to get an operator). Opt-outs can be costly. Chatbots are an investment, and they must demonstrate a return on business value in order to remain viable. Containment loss due to too many opt-outs can sink a business case. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p8"> 
   <p>Users will opt out for a variety of reasons that often require different strategies and approaches to resolve. Regardless of the type of bot you are managing, be it voice, text, FAQ, process-oriented, or even routing agents, identifying where your users opt out within the conversation can give you clues about why they did so. Learning why users opt out will help you design an experience that minimizes opting out, which should improve your containment. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p9"> 
   <p>In this chapter, we’ll explore some conversational AI solutions that suffered from containment loss due to users opting out and discuss how each challenge was resolved. Different use cases may have different solutions, depending on the organization’s priorities, resources, and constraints, but there are common patterns and principles that can increase the value of your conversational AI and make users more likely to stay with it. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p10"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">11.1</span> What drives opt-out behavior?</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p11"> 
   <p>Some users encounter a virtual agent, and the first thing they do is request a human—they don’t even try to interact with the conversational AI. We call this an <em>immediate opt-out</em>. Other times, a user will initially go along with (opt <em>in</em> to) a virtual agent experience but attempt to opt out later in the conversation. Their reasons tend to be quite different from the initial opt-out drivers and are often an indication that there is some problem with the overall conversational design or perhaps just with a particular step in a flow. Weak understanding can also be a root cause. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p12"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">11.1.1</span> Immediate opt-out drivers</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p13"> 
   <p>By their nature, immediate opt-outs provide very little information about the user’s reason. Collecting data on this is difficult, but it can be obtained through surveys or following up on the agent escalation (a very manual, time-consuming effort). Our research uncovered a few different drivers for this behavior, which were not mutually exclusive.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p14"> 
   <h4 class=" readable-text-h4">Prior poor experience with an IVR, chatbot, or virtual agent</h4> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p15"> 
   <p>Interactive voice response (IVR) allows a user to interact with a computer using a phone’s keypad or simple voice commands. Early IVR systems were around by the 1970s, but in the 2000s, they became cheaper to deploy and have since been ubiquitous in the modern world. You would be hard-pressed to find a single person who hasn’t been annoyed by a company greeting that spends thirty seconds telling you how to use their phone menu. Worse still is the warning that it is <em>“</em>important to listen to all of the options” (as their menu may have changed)!</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p16"> 
   <p>Chatbots have also been with us for quite some time, though successfully getting them to do something functionally useful is relatively recent, and they are still evolving into true virtual assistants. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p17"> 
   <p>Users may not be able to tell the difference between an IVR, simple chatbot, or robust virtual assistant. Quite frankly, they don’t care. Prior bad experiences are going to bias many people against automated systems. There are even corners of the internet that specialize in “hacks” that people have discovered to bypass automated systems and get directly routed to a company’s human agent queue.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p18"> 
   <h4 class=" readable-text-h4">The user judges their problem is too complex for a machine</h4> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p19"> 
   <p>Sometimes a user believes their situation is so unique or complex that it is beyond the capabilities of an automated system. Sometimes they are right; other times they are not. Judgments about complexity and uniqueness are relative to the individual, and they may not know that thousands of others have experienced a similar problem. This can be related to prior experience, but that isn’t always the case. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p20"> 
   <p>These users opt out because they believe they will end up needing an agent anyways. They see the automated system as a waste of their time, prolonging or obstructing their path to resolution.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p21"> 
   <h4 class=" readable-text-h4">Preference for human interaction</h4> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p22"> 
   <p>Connecting with other humans is fundamental to our survival as a species, so some people prefer dealing with a real person. Their needs may have nothing to do with the solution’s capability and can include loneliness, sensitive or embarrassing topics, mistrust of machines and automated systems, language or accessibility barriers, etc. This is increasingly becoming a generational phenomenon. Older users are more likely to opt out because they may find it difficult to interact with a machine, whereas digital natives usually have an easier time navigating automated systems. Regardless of age, you will probably always have users who prefer human interaction.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p23"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">11.1.2</span> Motivations for later opt-outs</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p24"> 
   <p>Users who opt out after initially engaging with a virtual assistant often do so because they are struggling with a particular interaction. Such occurrences can usually be tied to a specific task, action, or step within the conversational flow, making it a bit easier to identify a root cause. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p25"> 
   <h4 class=" readable-text-h4">Bot does not understand the user’s request </h4> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p26"> 
   <p>When the bot does not understand a user’s request, the user may opt out. This will most often occur early in a conversation, but it can occur anywhere. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p27"> 
   <p>It is standard practice to allow a certain number of retry attempts for user input before escalating them. The average is three, but your use case may have a higher or lower threshold. This practice is a critical tool for containment, but user tolerance for machine errors can be lower and less forgiving than it would be with a human. Users may opt out after being asked to repeat themselves once or twice, feeling that the bot is incapable of understanding. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p28"> 
   <h4 class=" readable-text-h4">User does not understand what the bot is asking</h4> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p29"> 
   <p>A poorly worded question from the bot may confuse the user. The user may not be clear about the type of response the bot is looking for or the expected format. A user may ask the bot to repeat, but if the same question is presented, the user might still be confused. This will result in the user feeling stuck, and they will likely ask for a human to help them get unstuck.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p30"> 
   <h4 class=" readable-text-h4">User does not have or know the requested information</h4> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p31"> 
   <p>If a user is asked to provide information they do not have, they may say, “I don’t know” or “I don’t have that,” or they may simply ask for an agent. If a task flow cannot move forward without certain information, and no alternatives are presented, the user knows they aren’t going to reach their goal without agent intervention.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p32"> 
   <h4 class=" readable-text-h4">User feels like they are not progressing</h4> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p33"> 
   <p>A user might opt out if they feel that the conversation is stuck in a loop, is bouncing between menus, or has reached a dead end. This could be caused by an actual bug in your dialogue logic, or it could be that the conversational design is failing to indicate progress toward the user’s goal. In any case, they are going to get frustrated and look for a way out.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p34"> 
   <h4 class=" readable-text-h4">User does not like the answer or outcome, or they had a different expectation</h4> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p35"> 
   <p>Your bot may provide a response that is technically correct, but it still makes the user unhappy. They may ask for an agent in the hope that they can reach a different outcome. They may also feel that the information was insufficient and will ask for an agent if the experience does not appear to provide an opportunity for follow-up or additional requests.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p36"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">11.1.3</span> Gathering data on opt-out behavior</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p37"> 
   <p>In order to determine if your solution is losing containment due to opt-outs, you must collect data. Some conversational platforms come with the ability to report on the actions or tasks that were invoked during a conversation. They may also provide data on whether or not the interaction concluded successfully. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p38"> 
   <p>Sometimes, the out-of-the-box analytics aren’t sufficient for providing actionable metrics. In those cases, you can instrument your dialogue with context variables at key points in the flow. Good instrumentation of your dialogue flows can help you identify and prioritize areas for improvement. (You may need a data warehouse and an enterprise or custom reporting tool to track this data over time.)</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p39"> 
   <p>For a complex task-oriented solution, you might use breadcrumbs to mark the start or completion of major flows and subflows. Figure 11.1 shows an example of opt-out data grouped by the major dialogue task flow in which the request for an agent occurred. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p40"> 
   <p>If your dialogue is instrumented to track the exact step where an opt-out occurs, you can look for trends to help you uncover the root cause, as seen in figure 11.2. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p41"> 
   <p>The first thing you might do with this information, especially for a process-oriented bot like the one in our example, is determine which task flows are considered immediate opt-outs. A simple question and answer (Q&amp;A) bot may only have an initial greeting. Everything after that would be an “other” opt-out. </p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p52"> 
   <p>You’ve likely heard the saying, “You never get a second chance to make a first impression.” Immediate opt-outs are a sign that a user is not impressed. You only have a brief chance to convince a user that they are in the right place and that your virtual assistant is competent, capable, and efficient. This section provides strategies to reduce the likelihood of a user asking for an agent right away. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p53"> 
   <p>The line between what constitutes an “immediate opt-out” versus an “other opt-out” within your dialogue flow is not arbitrary, but it is flexible. It may occur in the first step or in the first few steps. The distinction is meant to identify a point in a conversational flow where the user has agency to either agree to opt in or attempt to opt out. For an FAQ-style bot, a request for agent in the very first utterance would be considered an “immediate opt-out,” and everything after that would be an “other opt-out.”</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p54"> 
   <p>What follows are three strategies that will have the greatest effect on reducing immediate opt-outs. </p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p56"> 
   <p>What makes a user feel good about an automated interaction? Universal customer care principles apply: users should feel that they have reached the right place, that they are in good hands, and that their time is valued.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p57"> 
   <p>The first immediate opt-out driver we discussed in this chapter was prior poor experience with an IVR, chatbot, or virtual agent. Your bot’s greeting or introduction will set the tone for the conversational experience. This is your chance to gain the user’s trust—to convince them that that your virtual agent can be just as effective and efficient as a human agent at helping them reach their goal. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p58"> 
   <p>In chapter 1, we teased a dramatic improvement that addressed the challenge of “immediate opt-out” by users. We worked with a regional utility company’s virtual assistant that was losing over half of the callers to immediate opt-outs. The assistant was an extension of a larger IVR (voice) system (the main customer service line). This pilot program was intended to handle two self-service tasks: stop a utility service or transfer the service to a new address. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p59"> 
   <p>The assumption was that everyone who reached our virtual assistant intended to do one of these two things (stop or transfer their utility service), based on the IVR menu selections that delivered the caller to our solution. Information about the user and their menu selection was passed to the virtual assistant, which immediately launched the corresponding use case flow. The following listing shows the user’s experience, first with the IVR and then with the handoff to the virtual assistant.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p60"> 
   <h5 class=" listing-container-h5 browsable-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Listing 11.1</span> Handoff from IVR to virtual assistant</h5>

<strong>USER</strong>: Speak to an agent.</pre>  
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p61"> 
   <p>In the early production logs, we noticed a significant volume of users opting out, often right away. Though our utility company’s virtual agent pilot was technically very capable, many callers wouldn’t give it a chance. We listened to call recordings and discovered that the user experience as a whole felt disjointed. Customers dialed a number, reached an IVR (with a particular IVR “voice”), and navigated to a menu of service-related topics. If the caller chose to stop or transfer their service, they were routed to our virtual agent, but the transition was abrupt—a different voice bypassed greeting the caller (the original justification was that the caller had already been greeted by the IVR) and dove right into the task with seemingly optimal efficiency.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p62"> 
   <p>We could hear the confusion in the initial silence of some callers when they reached the virtual assistant. There were long hesitations, audible sighs, or stammering (“uh…,” “um…,” “hmm”). They hadn’t been introduced to this new agent. They were confused by the first question, which was procedurally appropriate but conversationally came off as impersonal and clunky. A human agent wouldn’t have opened the conversation like that. They would have introduced themselves in a welcoming tone. If the IVR collected information about the caller’s goal, a human agent would have confirmed this with the user before proceeding (“I see you’re calling about transferring your utility service, is that correct?”). </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p63"> 
   <p>We redesigned the experience from the opening line, starting with a context-aware greeting and introduction. The virtual agent was given a persona and a more conversational tone, as shown in the following listing.</p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p69"> 
   <p>Setting expectations up front is vital. It is not uncommon for companies to launch a pilot virtual assistant with limited scope or capabilities. When your solution only provides a subset of the topics or tasks a user might want, you need to communicate this up front. By doing so, users will either be assured that they are in the right place, or they will recognize that they are not. Especially in these scenarios, the greeting (or solution entry point) is a good time to announce the chatbot’s purpose and capabilities (or get a quick confirmation from the user before pushing forward).</p>

   <p>Our utility company’s virtual agent greeting was expanded to confirm the user’s goal (using context indicating their IVR selection).

Other times, it was simply a case of “fat finger”—an erroneous and often unnoticed dial pad selection. These “other” responses confirmed our hypothesis—our users would say “back” or “no” or express a different goal.

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p105"> 
   <p>For voice solutions, it is imperative that you keep the cognitive load to a minimum; craft your questions to be direct and concise.

   <h4 class=" readable-text-h4">Use technology to ease pain points</h4> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p108"> 
   <p>There are situations where you can employ technology to ease user pain points and facilitate understanding. For example, an insurance company had a voice assistant for members. Member ID numbers could be 9 or 13 digits, and sometimes they were preceded by a letter. We didn’t want to burden the caller with a message about how long the number might be or whether or not to include the preceding letter, if there even was one. That’s too much cognitive load, especially on a first pass. We simply asked, “What’s your member ID?” Some users would speak this number, including the letter. Others would key in the number using the dial pad, and they would ignore any preceding letter. We wanted to accommodate natural user behavior, so we made our logic more robust. The caller could include or exclude the preceding alpha character as long as we detected the right number of digits to perform a lookup. Instead of pestering the user with retries, the solution would fill in trivial information and attempt to perform a lookup if it had enough information (e.g., “123456789” and “X123456789” were both acceptable). If needed, our retry messaging would change the message slightly to guide the user to provide a valid input. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p109"> 
   <p>Another tool for improving robustness and accuracy, if your technology allows it, is custom speech models. Speech transcriptions of numbers or letters are difficult to collect over a voice channel due to phoneme similarity (e.g., “8” can often sound like “H,” so we selected speech models that were optimized to such inputs). </p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p111"> 
   <p>Self-service task flows can range in complexity from answering a question to simple triage to multistep, multiflow, dynamic user journeys. In these more complex flows, your dialogue design should signal the progression of the task or process. If the user feels that this is going to go on forever or that they are looping through an unending series of menus, they may believe that a conversation with a human would be more efficient. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p112"> 
   <p>Progress can be signaled in a variety of ways and should be optimized for the medium. Before initiating a long task flow, set the user’s expectations about what you will need from them and how long it will take. A text-based platform can be more verbose or provide visual indicators, such as numbering questions or showing progress bars. A phone channel will need to be more succinct but can give indicators such as “We’re almost done” or “Just a few more questions.” </p>

   <p>When a user receives an answer from your bot or reaches the conclusion of a task flow, they may find that their goal is still unmet. Does your dialogue flow have potential outcomes that are technically correct or appropriate but that will tend to leave the user’s problem unresolved? Think about the position the user is in. They have a need, they get an answer, but the need still exists. If the dialogue flow has concluded without addressing that need, the user is going to opt out. What other choice do they have? </p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p118"> 
   <p>When you’re building a virtual assistant, remember that you are attempting to simulate a more human-like experience. Empathy comes naturally to humans, but it must be intentionally integrated into a machine-driven interaction. Assume that your users are making an effort on their end of the conversation. When you need to retry or repair the conversation, don’t make the user feel they are to blame. A conversational designer should craft error messages in a way that guides the user back on track without implying fault.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p119"> 
   <p>For example, our insurance company solution could look up claims with a claim number, which was thirteen digits. Originally, it seemed logical to provide “informative” information in the retry output. This turned out to sound rude over the phone, as shown in the following listing.</p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p121"> 
   <p>Sometimes the user failed to provide enough digits; other times, the speech service failed to detect all of the spoken digits or mistranscribed the user response.

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p132"> 
   <p>A good faith attempt to keep the user in channel can work in many scenarios. This must be undertaken with care—a customer should never feel that they are being held hostage by the system.

   <p>You might implement such a flow at the beginning of a conversational interaction to help improve containment loss due to immediate opt-outs. It can also be used strategically after a user has appeared to successfully complete a flow.

When an in-scope request is recognized, the bot may make an incentivized offer to keep the user in-channel.

<strong>VIRTUAL ASSISTANT</strong>: We are currently experiencing long hold times, but I can help speed things up by asking you a few more questions. It sounds like you want to stop your electric service and get a final bill. Is that correct?

   <p>The virtual agent would then proceed to collect as much information as possible, until an error occurred or the caller requested an agent a second time. This enabled us to self-serve the customer either to completion, or to collect as much information as possible, reducing the amount of time the human agent would need to spend resolving the call.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p156"> 
   <p>This new design had great success. Out of callers who immediately opted out but expressed an in-scope intent, 38% were convinced to stay with the virtual agent and be successfully authenticated. When paired with other updates described in this chapter, the overall use case completion rate increased from 27% to 30%.</p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p162"> 
   <p>In chapter 5, we showed how to use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to generate chatbot responses at runtime. But if you prefer static and controlled dialogue, you can still use generative AI to assist your conversational designer during the build phase of a project. Conversational designers are excellent at crafting dialogue that meets the needs of both the system and users. If you don’t have a designer handy, you can use generative AI to help you craft dialogue messages that achieve your goals.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p163"> 
   <p>In this section, we’ll demonstrate several techniques for improving static output responses using generative AI. </p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p165"> 
   <p>It’s difficult to write good error dialogue. Our first instinct can be to provide information that’s technically true but brusque to the user. This is especially difficult in voice channels, where the user may make a mistake and not be aware of it. For instance, a user being asked to provide an identifier of a certain length may forget one of the digits (or mistakenly add an additional digit). </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p166"> 
   <p>For a Social Security number (nine digits in length), a true-but-brusque error message would be “I did not get nine digits. Enter a valid Social Security number now.” Let’s use generative AI to improve that message. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p167"> 
   <p>Since this is a creative task, we’ll use an instructible model (mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01-q) and sampling decoding. With sampling decoding, the responses will be nondeterministic. We’ll run this prompt multiple times to generate multiple responses to choose from. </p>
