&#13;
<p>The <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Microsoft Azure" data-see="Azure" data-type="indexterm" id="id227"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Microsoft Azure AI-900" data-see="AI-900 certification exam" data-type="indexterm" id="id228"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI-900" data-see="AI-900 certification exam" data-type="indexterm" id="id229"/>Microsoft<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-type="indexterm" id="icd101"/> Azure AI-900 certification, officially known as Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals, is focused on AI and cloud computing, all through the lens of Azure. Whether you’re completely new to AI or just starting your journey with cloud technology, this certification is designed to ease you into the essentials. Microsoft labels this as a “900-level” certification. This means it’s entry-level and perfect if you’re just dipping your toes into these areas. And you don’t need to be a coding expert or a data science genius to succeed.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>At its core, the AI-900 introduces you to foundational AI concepts—like ML and NLP—while walking you through how AI <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="workloads, defined" data-type="indexterm" id="id230"/>workloads function in Azure. A <em>workload</em> is the specific tasks, processes, or operations that a system, application, or service performs. It’s a term you will often see on the exam. Examples include training ML models or using services like speech recognition or image analysis.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Sure, having a little background in cloud computing or understanding basic AI concepts can make the exam easier, but it’s not a requirement. If these categories are new to you, don’t worry. This book will guide you step-by-step, from square one, and help you make sense of it all.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Each chapter is crafted to get you fully ready for the AI-900 exam. We’ll take it one concept at a time, explaining everything in plain language and showing you practical examples using Azure’s AI tools, so you can see exactly how things work in the real world. And to give you a boost of confidence, there’s a set of 95 sample questions that mirror the exam format.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In this chapter, we’ll start by breaking down the structure and objectives of the AI-900 exam, so you’ll know exactly what to expect and how to prepare for success from the get-go.</p>&#13;

<h1>AI-900 Exam Details</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The AI-900 exam might seem intimidating at first, but with a clear understanding of the structure and some smart preparation, you’ll be well on your way to success. Here’s what you need to know.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>First, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="question format" data-type="indexterm" id="id267"/>the exam itself consists of <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="question format, of AI-900 exam" data-type="indexterm" id="id268"/>40–60 questions that come in a variety of formats: multiple choice, drag-and-drop, and even hot area questions. To pass, you’ll need to score 700 out of 1,000 points. Because Microsoft uses a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="scoring system" data-type="indexterm" id="id269"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="scoring system" data-type="indexterm" id="id270"/>scaled scoring system, you don’t necessarily have to get exactly 70% of the answers right, but that’s roughly where the target sits.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You’ll <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="timing" data-type="indexterm" id="id271"/>have 45 minutes to tackle the questions, but Microsoft gives you a full 65 minutes total. This is to set aside time for reviewing instructions, accepting the Microsoft Certification Exam Candidate Agreement, and, if you’re feeling generous afterward, providing some feedback.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When it comes to taking the exam, you’ve got options. You can sit for it either <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="taking online versus in-person" data-type="indexterm" id="id272"/>online or at a test center. The registration fee<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="registration fee" data-type="indexterm" id="id273"/> is $99, though this may vary depending on where you’re located. The exam is available through<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Pearson VUE" data-type="indexterm" id="id274"/> Pearson VUE or Certiport, and if you’re a student or educator, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Certiport" data-type="indexterm" id="id275"/>Certiport is likely your go-to. The exam is offered in a wide range of languages, including English, Japanese, Chinese (both simplified and traditional), Korean, French, German, and more.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You’re allowed to take unscheduled <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="breaks" data-type="indexterm" id="id276"/>breaks during the exam. But the clock keeps ticking, so use that time wisely. Any questions you look at before a break are locked in, meaning you can’t go back to them—even if you didn’t answer them or marked them for review.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you don’t pass the exam on the first try, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="retaking exam" data-type="indexterm" id="id277"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="retaking" data-type="indexterm" id="id278"/>you can retake it after a 24-hour waiting period, though you’ll have to pay the fee again. For additional attempts, there’s a <span class="keep-together">14-day</span> waiting period and a limit of five attempts in a 12-month period. If technical issues throw a wrench in your exam, Microsoft may grant an exception to the waiting period.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Microsoft also allows for accommodation<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="accommodation for specific needs and disabilities" data-type="indexterm" id="id279"/> for those with specific needs or disabilities. Whether it’s extra time, assistive technology, or even a personal assistant, accommodations are available. Just make sure to request them in advance and provide the necessary documentation, such as a note from a physician.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As for your certification, it remains <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="validity and recertification" data-type="indexterm" id="id280"/>valid as long as the associated technology stays relevant. That means no need for immediate recertification unless major platform changes come into play.</p>&#13;
