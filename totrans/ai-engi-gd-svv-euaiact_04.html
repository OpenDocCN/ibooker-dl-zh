<h1><span class="label">Chapter 4. </span>AI System Assessment and Tailoring AI Engineering for Different Risk Levels</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In this chapter, the main learning<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI system assessment" data-type="indexterm" id="id511"/> objective is to understand how to practically classify different AI system risk levels and how to design AI engineering processes for each risk level (see <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_4_figure_1_1748539919001611">Figure 4-1</a> for a visual of the steps to take to move toward compliance with the EU AI Act). We’ll explore the EU AI Act’s risk classification framework and the obligation mapping phase. For high-risk and limited-risk AI systems, careful planning of data governance, AI governance, and MLOps processes is essential to ensure compliance with the Act.</p>&#13;

<p>This chapter will help you answer the following questions:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>How many AI systems are currently in place or intended to be put into <span class="keep-together">production</span>?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>What risk categories do those AI systems belong to?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>How can clarity be established about the role of the provider or deployer of each AI model?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In discussions about the EU AI Act, people frequently use terms such as “AI compliance,” “AI governance,” and “risk management.” While closely related and complementary, these are distinct concepts. Let’s begin by clarifying what each one means.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>We explored AI compliance<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI compliance, governance, and risk management (comparison)" data-type="indexterm" id="aicgrm-comp"/> and governance in the previous chapters. As a reminder, <em>AI compliance</em> focuses on adhering to legal, regulatory, and policy standards, ensuring ethical behavior, and promoting transparency through rigorous processes, metrics, and stakeholder engagement. <em>AI governance </em>establishes a framework for ethical and responsible AI development, emphasizing transparency, stakeholder engagement, and balancing innovation with ethical considerations. <em>AI risk management<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI risks" data-type="indexterm" id="ai-risk-2"/></em> involves<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI risk management" data-type="indexterm" id="ai-risk-man-1"/> identifying and addressing risks associated with AI systems, focusing on robust assessment practices, effective mitigation strategies, and promoting a culture of awareness and proactive action.</p>&#13;

<h1>AI Risk</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/Pc0cW">NIST</a> describes risk in the context of AI systems as a function of the negative impact, or magnitude of harm, that would arise if a certain circumstance or event occurs, and the likelihood of its occurrence. That negative impact or harm can be experienced by individuals, groups, communities, organizations, society, the environment, or the planet.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Here are some well-known examples that illustrate the diverse range of risks associated with AI, spanning ethical, social, economic, and technical domains:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Algorithmic bias</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>AI systems can perpetuate<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI risks" data-secondary="algorithmic bias" data-type="indexterm" id="id512"/> or strengthen existing societal biases, leading to unfair treatment of certain groups. For example, facial recognition systems have shown higher error rates for women and people of color.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt class="pagebreak-before">Privacy violations and social manipulation</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>AI systems that process large<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI risks" data-secondary="privacy violations and social manipulation" data-type="indexterm" id="id513"/> amounts of personal data can pose risks to individual privacy. For instance, AI algorithms used by social media platforms can be exploited to influence user behavior and opinions, potentially impacting democratic processes. The Cambridge Analytica scandal<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Cambridge Analytica scandal" data-type="indexterm" id="id514"/>, where personal data from millions of Facebook users was harvested and used for targeted political advertising, is a prominent example.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Deepfakes</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>AI-generated videos<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI risks" data-secondary="deepfakes" data-type="indexterm" id="id515"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="deepfakes" data-type="indexterm" id="id516"/> or audio recordings can be used to spread misinformation or manipulate public opinion.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Autonomous weapons</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The development of AI-powered weapons<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI risks" data-secondary="autonomous weapons" data-type="indexterm" id="id517"/> that can operate without human control raises ethical concerns and the risk of unintended harm.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>AI-enabled cyberattacks</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>AI can be used to enhance the scale of cyberattacks<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI risks" data-secondary="cyberattacks" data-type="indexterm" id="id518"/>, making them more difficult to detect and defend against.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Lack of transparency</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The opaque nature of some AI algorithms<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI risks" data-secondary="lack of transparency" data-type="indexterm" id="id519"/> and models can make it difficult to understand or explain their decision-making processes, which is problematic in high-stakes domains like healthcare and criminal justice.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Environmental impact</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The energy consumed to train and operate large AI models<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI risks" data-secondary="environmental impact" data-type="indexterm" id="id520"/> contributes to carbon emissions and raises environmental concerns.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Safety risks in critical systems</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>AI failures<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI risks" data-secondary="safety risks in critical systems" data-type="indexterm" id="id521"/> in critical infrastructure or systems—such as healthcare, power grids, or transportation—can have severe consequences.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Intellectual property issues</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>AI-generated content raises<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI risks" data-secondary="intellectual property issues" data-type="indexterm" id="id522"/> questions about copyright and ownership, potentially infringing on intellectual property rights.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Autonomous vehicle accidents</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>While designed to improve safety<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI risks" data-secondary="autonomous vehicle accidents" data-type="indexterm" id="id523"/>, self-driving cars have been involved in accidents, highlighting the challenges of integrating AI into complex real-world <span class="keep-together">environments</span>.</p>&#13;

Compliance is primarily reactive in nature, establishing the baseline requirements for governance, while effective governance is proactive, guiding the responsible development and use of AI. Risk management complements and informs compliance and governance efforts by identifying and addressing potential threats in a timely manner. When implemented holistically and embedded into daily operations, these three pillars provide essential support for compliance with the EU AI Act.</p>&#13;

<h1>Creating an AI System Inventory</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To navigate the EU AI Act and understand its impact on your organization, you should first get an overview of your existing AI systems and potential AI use cases to assess whether they are subject to the legislation.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Note that AI use cases developed as internal research projects are generally excluded from compliance obligations.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Later in this chapter, I will outline the different maturity levels of AI projects and specify when the EU AI Act’s requirements must be fulfilled. For now, please note that the Act impacts AI systems based on their risk level and intended use, rather than their development stage.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As described in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#chapter_1_understanding_the_ai_regulations_1748539916832819">Chapter 1</a>, the EU AI Act applies to:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Providers placing AI systems on the EU market or putting them into service</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Users of AI systems located within the EU</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Providers and users outside the EU, if the AI system’s output is used within the EU</p>&#13;

<p>As a reminder, Article 3 of the EU AI Act defines an AI system as “a machine-based system that is designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy and that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment, and that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments.”</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You’ll want to create a comprehensive inventory template to catalog all AI systems used or developed within your organization, capturing key attributes for each system. <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_4_figure_2_1748539919001650">Figure 4-2</a> shows an example of what this might look like.</p>&#13;

<p>Depending on your organization’s needs, you can create this template using tools like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets (as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_4_figure_3_1748539919001677">Figure 4-3</a>), Airtable, or more sophisticated database management systems. Knowledge management platforms such as Confluence or Notion can also be helpful for creating a catalog of AI systems, as can specialized AI governance tools like watsonx.ai, Dataiku, or Domino Data Lab.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="EU AI Act" data-secondary="applicability" data-type="indexterm" id="eu-ai-appl-1"/> EU AI Act’s applicability to a given AI system depends on several factors, including whether the system falls within the Act’s the scope and definition of AI, whether it has already been placed on the market or put into service, and the timing of the Act’s entry into force and application.</p>&#13;

<h1>Unacceptable Risk—Prohibited AI Practices</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Human <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="prohibited AI practices" data-type="indexterm" id="prohib-ai-1"/>values such as privacy<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="unacceptable risk" data-seealso="prohibited AI practices" data-type="indexterm" id="id529"/>, integrity, social justice, transparency, and diversity are at the core of EU law, and with the growing adoption of AI technologies, they are becoming increasingly important in software and AI development. To ensure the safety of AI, it’s more effective to regulate its applications rather than the technology itself.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Technology itself is neither inherently good nor bad, but it can be used in benevolent or harmful ways. To underscore this idea, <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_4_table_2_1748539919012629">Table 4-2</a> gives some examples of useful and harmful applications of the same technologies. This is important because AI technology is general-purpose, and developers—such as those who release open-weight and open source foundation models—can’t fully control how others might use it. To give a specific example, fake reviews were a problem on many websites even before the widespread adoption of generative AI, requiring companies to devote significant resources to detecting and removing them. Traditional fake reviews often used similar language, making them easier to spot. However, the ability of GenAI tools to automatically rephrase or rewrite text has made detecting fake reviews increasingly challenging. In a case like this, the solution is not to limit the use of the technology itself; instead, when AI is used in a harmful way, it is that specific application that should be addressed and, if necessary, restricted or halted.</p>&#13;

<h2>Prohibited AI Use Cases</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The EU AI Act aims to protect fundamental rights, democracy, and the rule of law by banning AI applications that are incompatible with core EU values and rights. In general, the Act prohibits AI systems from:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Using subliminal, manipulative, or deceptive techniques to misinterpret behavior and prevent informed decision making, causing significant harm</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Exploiting vulnerabilities related to age, disability, or socioeconomic circumstances to distort behavior, causing significant harm</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Utilizing biometric categorization systems to infer sensitive attributes such as race, political opinions, religious beliefs, and sexual orientation</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Conducting social scoring (i.e., evaluating individuals based on social behavior or personal traits), which can lead to discriminative treatment</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Creating or expanding facial recognition databases through untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Inferring emotions in workplaces or educational institutions, except for medical or safety reasons</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>All prohibited AI systems were required to have been removed from the EU market by February 2025, six months after the Act entered into force (please refer to <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#chapter_1_understanding_the_ai_regulations_1748539916832819">Chapter 1</a> for details on the implementation timeline). It is important to correctly identify and classify these systems to ensure they are removed from operation, in accordance with the regulation.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the some of the specific types of AI systems that are <span class="keep-together">prohibited</span>:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Systems that manipulate people through subliminal techniques</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>These are systems that use hidden tricks, like sounds or images, to influence people without them realizing it—for example, an AI system that plays barely audible music in a store to influence people to buy more things.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Systems that use facial recognition to categorize people based on sensitive characteristics</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>This means systems that use facial recognition<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="prohibited AI practices" data-secondary="facial recognition" data-type="indexterm" id="prohib-face-1"/> technology to sort people into groups based on their race, religion, sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics. Such systems are prohibited to protect people from being discriminated against based on these characteristics.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt class="pagebreak-before">Social scoring systems</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>These are systems that create a score<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="prohibited AI practices" data-secondary="social scoring" data-type="indexterm" id="id530"/> for a person based on their online behavior or other personal information. This score could then be used to deny people jobs, housing, or other opportunities. (See <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_4_deep_dive_social_scoring_1748539919035416">“Deep Dive: Social Scoring”</a> for an example of social scoring.)</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Law enforcement facial recognition in public places (except for specific cases)</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>This means that police and other law enforcement agencies cannot normally use facial recognition technology to scan people in public places. There are some exceptions, though, such as when they are looking for missing people, trying to prevent terrorism, or trying to catch criminals.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>AI systems that predict criminality</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>These are systems that use artificial intelligence to try to guess whether someone is likely to commit a crime in the future. This is not allowed because it could lead to people being punished for something they haven’t done.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Systems that build facial recognition databases without people’s permission</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>This means that companies and organizations cannot collect large databases<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="prohibited AI practices" data-secondary="facial recognition" data-startref="prohib-face-1" data-type="indexterm" id="id531"/> of people’s faces without their permission. This is to protect people’s privacy.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Emotion recognition systems at work or school (except for special cases)</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>These are systems that use artificial intelligence to try to guess what emotions people are feeling. This is generally not allowed in workplaces or schools, but there are some exceptions. For example, an AI system might be allowed to do this if it is being used to help people with autism learn to understand emotions.</p>&#13;

<h2>Deep Dive: Social Scoring</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Some forms of social scoring are already present in our daily lives. For example, financial institutions may use credit scoring systems that consider past financial behavior and social media data. Similarly, some insurance companies adjust rates based on data collected from fitness trackers. According to the EU AI Act, <a href="https://oreil.ly/cWYg4">Recital 31</a>, social scoring systems are prohibited due to the following key concerns:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Discriminatory outcomes</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Social scoring systems may lead to discriminatory results and the exclusion of certain groups.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Violation of fundamental rights</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>These systems can violate the rights to dignity, non-discrimination, equality, and justice. There are also concerns about AI tools that compromise user privacy by collecting sensitive data without consent.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Unfair evaluation</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Social scoring systems evaluate or classify individuals based on multiple data points related to their social behavior across various contexts or on known, inferred, or predicted personal characteristics over time. The scoring mechanisms often lack transparency, fairness, and accountability.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Harmful treatment</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The social scores obtained from these systems can result in negative treatment of individuals or groups in social contexts unrelated to where the data was initially generated or collected.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Extreme consequences</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Social scoring can lead to harmful treatment that is unjustified relative to the gravity of a person’s social behavior.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Broad impact</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>These systems can affect individuals’ access to services, employment, or other opportunities.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The EU AI Act aims to mitigate these risks by prohibiting social scoring AI systems. This ban applies to public and private actors using AI<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="prohibited AI practices" data-startref="prohib-ai-1" data-type="indexterm" id="id532"/> for social scoring.</p>&#13;

<h1>Determining EU AI Act Obligations</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To determine your obligations under the EU AI Act, you need to take two fundamental steps when assessing your AI systems:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ol>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Determine whether the Act applies to any AI systems in your inventory and clarify the scope of your obligations by answering the following questions:</p>&#13;
&#13;
	<ul>&#13;
		<li>&#13;
		<p>Do they meet the Act’s definition of an “AI system”? (For more on this, see the following sidebar.)</p>&#13;
		</li>&#13;
		<li>&#13;
		<p>If so, are they within the scope of the Act based on their intended use and risk classification? Those systems with low risk are exempt.</p>&#13;
		</li>&#13;
		<li>&#13;
		<p>Are they considered high risk?</p>&#13;
		</li>&#13;
		<li>&#13;
		<p>Do transparency obligations apply?</p>&#13;
		</li>&#13;
	</ul>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Identify your organization’s role with respect to each system. Is it acting as a provider or deployer?</p>&#13;

<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="chapter_4_how_to_determine_whether_a_system_qualifies_as_an_1748539919035612">&#13;
<h1>How to Determine Whether a System Qualifies as an AI System <span class="keep-together">Under the EU AI Act</span></h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To determine whether an AI system meets the Act’s definition, consider the following questions:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ol>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p><em>Is it a machine-based (computational) system?</em><strong> </strong>The system must be implemented in software and run on hardware (e.g., computers, sensors, robots).</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p><em>Is it designed to operate with some level of autonomy?</em><strong> </strong>Does it make decisions or perform actions <em>without constant human direction</em> (even if partially supervised)?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p><em>Does it produce outputs based on input data?</em><strong> </strong>For example, does it generate <em>predictions, recommendations, decisions, or content</em> by processing data?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p><em>Are the outputs generated through inference (not just fixed rules)?</em><strong> </strong>Does it use <em>statistical, logical, symbolic, or machine learning techniques</em> to infer a result from data?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p><em>Is it designed to achieve an explicit or implicit objective?</em><strong> </strong>Does it aim to solve a task, meet a goal, or optimize an outcome (e.g., classify images, suggest content)?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p><em>Can its outputs influence a physical or virtual environment?</em><strong> </strong>Can it impact the real world or a digital system (e.g., control a robot, change what a user sees)?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p><em>Optional but relevant: Can it adapt after deployment?</em><strong> </strong>Does it have the ability to <em>learn or change behavior over time</em> based on its experience? (Note: This is not required, but strengthens the case.)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you answered “yes” to questions 1 through 6, then the system qualifies as an AI system under the EU AI Act. If you answered “no” to any of the first three or four questions, it’s likely not considered an AI system under the Act.</p>&#13;
</div></aside>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Once you’ve identified which of your AI systems meet the Act’s definition, the next step is to classify their risk level. Your exact obligations will vary depending on this classification.</p>&#13;

<h2>Framework for Classification of AI Systems by Risk Levels</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Having already discussed the unacceptable risk category, here we will consider the remaining three categories: high risk, limited risk, and minimal risk. Let’s start by reviewing the criteria that determine whether a system is classified as high risk.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="High risk" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="chapter_4_high_risk_1748539919035804">&#13;
<h3>High risk</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The classification rules for high-risk AI systems, outlined in <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Article 6: Classification Rules for High-Risk AI Systems" data-type="indexterm" id="id533"/><a href="https://oreil.ly/AyOj1">Article 6 of the EU AI Act</a>, aim to identify systems that may pose significant risks to health, safety, or fundamental rights. The classification takes into account both the AI system’s intended <span class="keep-together">purpose</span> and the specific context and conditions under which it is used. Key considerations include:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>AI systems are classified as high risk whether they are placed on the market or put into service as standalone products or as components of other products. For AI systems used as safety components of products, the classification aligns with the EU’s New Legislative Framework<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="EU New Legislative Framework" data-type="indexterm" id="id534"/>, ensuring consistency with broader product safety regulation.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>AI systems intended to be used as safety components of products covered by <a href="https://oreil.ly/d5LQd">EU harmonization legislation</a> are automatically classified as high risk.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>AI systems listed in <a href="https://oreil.ly/9-WO8">Annex III</a> are<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Annex III (high-risk systems)" data-type="indexterm" id="id535"/> classified as high risk. These include systems intended for use in the areas of:</p>&#13;
&#13;
	<ul>&#13;
		<li>&#13;
		<p>Biometric identification and categorization of natural persons (e.g., AI systems for remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces)</p>&#13;
		</li>&#13;
		<li>&#13;
		<p>Management and operation of critical infrastructure (e.g., AI systems used as safety components in the supply of water, gas, heating, or electricity)</p>&#13;
		</li>&#13;
		<li>&#13;
		<p>Education and vocational training (e.g., AI systems used to evaluate students or assess educational institutions)</p>&#13;
		</li>&#13;
		<li>&#13;
		<p class="fix_tracking">Employment, workers management, and access to self-employment (e.g., AI systems used for recruitment, promotion, and termination decisions)</p>&#13;
		</li>&#13;
		<li>&#13;
		<p class="fix_tracking">Access to and enjoyment of key private services and public services and benefits (e.g., AI systems used to evaluate creditworthiness or establish credit scores)</p>&#13;
		</li>&#13;
		<li>&#13;
		<p>Law enforcement (e.g., AI systems used by law enforcement to predict crimes or assess recidivism risk)</p>&#13;
		</li>&#13;
		<li>&#13;
		<p>Migration, asylum, and border control management (e.g., AI systems used to process asylum, visa, and residence permit applications)</p>&#13;
		</li>&#13;
		<li>&#13;
		<p>Administration of justice and democratic processes (e.g., AI systems used in judicial proceedings to assist judges)</p>&#13;
		</li>&#13;
	</ul>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Certain systems are exempted from high-risk classification even if they might otherwise qualify. These include:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;

<h4>EU AI Act high-risk system questionnaire</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Classifying AI applications as high risk means they are subject to stricter requirements under the EU AI Act related to risk management procedures, data governance measures, technical documentation, recordkeeping, transparency, human oversight, accuracy, and cybersecurity controls.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Reading and interpreting the EU AI Act can be daunting. To help with determining whether an AI system qualifies as high risk under the Act, I have prepared a straightforward questionnaire, divided into four main sections:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ol>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Application area</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Specific use cases</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Impact assessment</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Technical characteristics</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The questionnaire is presented in <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_4_table_3_1748539919012658">Table 4-3</a>. Start with section 1 and work through each section in turn. The more affirmative answers you have, especially in sections 1 and 2, the more likely it is that your AI system is considered high risk.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>Classifying an AI system with confidence can be challenging. In its white paper <a href="https://oreil.ly/a_oMu">“AI Act: Risk Classification of AI Systems from a Practical Perspective”</a>, the applied AI Institute examined more than 100 AI systems from different enterprise functions (marketing, production, purchasing, etc.) and determined that 18% were in the high-risk class, 42% were low risk, and for the remaining 40% it was unclear whether they fell into the high-risk class or not. The percentage of high-risk systems in this sample thus could be anywhere between 18% and 58%.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The study identified several ambiguities in defining criteria across different areas as the main causes of unclear risk classifications for AI systems. For example, in many cases it is not clear whether a system is functioning as a “safety component.”</p>&#13;

<h4>Interpretation guide</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you have affirmative answers in sections 1 and 2, or in section 1 combined with multiple affirmative answers in sections 3 and 4, your AI system is likely to be considered high risk under the EU AI Act. However, the final determination may depend on the specific context, implementation, and potential impact of your system.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>It’s important to note that the European Commission can adjust Annex III and add new high-risk AI systems as technology evolves, following the criteria outlined in <a href="https://oreil.ly/ipd1a">Article 7</a>. This allows the regulation to remain responsive to emerging AI applications and risks.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For a definitive assessment, it is recommended to consult legal experts and stay up-to-date on the latest guidance from EU <span class="keep-together">authorities</span>.</p>&#13;

<h3>Limited risk (transparency obligations)</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To be clear, the EU AI Act does not formally define a category of “limited-risk” AI systems<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="limited-risk AI systems" data-type="indexterm" id="id536"/>. Instead, it focuses on three main categories: prohibited AI practices under the unacceptable risk category (Article 5), high-risk AI systems (Article 6)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="high-risk AI systems" data-type="indexterm" id="h-r-ai-1"/>, and AI systems with specific transparency obligations (Article 50).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>However, for clarity, I use the term “limited risk” to refer to AI systems that are not explicitly prohibited or high risk but are still subject to the transparency obligations laid out in <a href="https://oreil.ly/cc73j">Article 50</a>. This includes:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ol>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>AI systems that are intended to interact with natural persons</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Emotion recognition systems and biometric categorization systems</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>AI systems that generate or manipulate image, audio, text, or video content (including deepfakes)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As for high-risk systems, I have created a questionnaire that you can use to determine whether your AI system has specific transparency obligations. I’ll discuss what those obligations are in <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#chapter_6_ai_engineering_for_limited_risk_ai_systems_1748539923606988">Chapter 6</a>.</p>&#13;

<h3>Low risk</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Even though the EU AI Act focuses more heavily on high-risk AI systems, it is still important address “low-risk” AI systems, as most AI currently in use across the EU falls into this category and some of these systems (such as chatbots and emotion recognition tools) may still be subject to transparency requirements.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The Act does not explicitly define a “low-risk” category. However, by process of elimination, low-risk AI systems<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="low-risk AI systems" data-type="indexterm" id="low-r-ai-sys-1"/> can be understood to be those that:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ol>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Do not involve practices prohibited under Article 5</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Are not classified as high risk under Article 6</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Are not subject to transparency obligations under the terms outlined in <span class="keep-together">Article 50</span></p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
&#13;
<p>These systems generally pose minimal risks to fundamental rights or public safety and are typically used for administrative or operational purposes rather than for making decisions with serious consequences.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Some examples of low-risk AI systems include:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Spam filters (AI systems that help to identify and filter unwanted emails)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Recommendation systems (AI systems that suggest products, movies, or other content based on user preferences)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Chatbots that provide customer service (AI systems that can answer simple questions and provide basic assistance)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>AI-powered games (AI systems that can generate challenges or adapt to player behavior)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since the EU AI Act primarily focuses on regulating high-risk AI systems and prohibiting certain AI practices, no specific obligations are defined for low-risk AI systems as a distinct category.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>Note that the classification of an AI system can depend on its specific context and intended use. Even a seemingly low-risk AI system<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="low-risk AI systems" data-startref="low-r-ai-sys-1" data-type="indexterm" id="id538"/> could become high risk if used in a way that could harm individuals or society.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For example, consider facial recognition technology,<strong> </strong>which can be used for purposes ranging from unlocking personal devices to <span class="keep-together">surveillance</span>:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Unlocking personal devices is considered minimal risk as it involves a consenting individual using the technology privately and poses little to no risk to broader society.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Surveillance by law enforcement, on the other hand, is classified as high risk due to its potential implications for fundamental rights and freedoms, such as privacy infringements and the risk of misidentification.</p>&#13;

<h2>Deployer or Provider</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As mentioned earlier, an organization’s obligations under the EU AI Act depend on two key factors: the AI system’s risk category and whether it acts as a deployer<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="key players" data-secondary="deployer" data-type="indexterm" id="id539"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="key players" data-secondary="provider" data-type="indexterm" id="id540"/> or provider of the system. Let’s review the definitions of those two roles.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Under the terms of the EU AI Act, a <em>provider</em> is any individual, company, public authority, agency, or other body that:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ol>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Develops an AI system or model, or has it developed by others</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Places the system or model on the market or puts it into service, either for a fee or free of charge</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Does so under their own name or trademark</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Examples of providers include a tech company like Google that develops and releases large language models such as Gemini and a startup that develops an AI algorithm for predicting stock market trends and offers it as a service.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">The EU AI Act defines a <em>deployer</em> as any individual, company, public authority, agency, or other body that:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ol>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Uses an AI system under their authority or control</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Does so in a professional or business context (personal, non-professional use is excluded)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This definition applies regardless of whether the deployer is located within the EU or not, as long as the AI system’s output is used within the EU.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Examples of deployers include a hospital using an AI system for medical diagnosis or treatment planning, a company using an AI-powered recruitment tool to screen job applicants, or a bank utilizing an AI system for credit scoring or loan approval.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>An important distinction is that providers develop, place on the market, or put into service AI systems under their own name or trademark, whereas deployers use AI systems within their professional activities but do not develop or market the systems themselves. A company that develops an AI system for its own use can act as both a provider and a deployer. Additionally, a deployer may become a provider if they substantially modify an AI system or use it for purposes not intended by the original <span class="keep-together">provider</span>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_4_table_5_1748539919012703">Table 4-5</a>, I provide a practical framework to help determine your organization’s role and to identify all the relevant players who may act as deployers or providers of an AI system. The first step is to analyze every party involved in the machine learning lifecycle, using the CRISP-ML(Q) phases as a guide. For each actor, outline their specific activities, identify their location, and determine who sets or redefines the intended purpose of the AI system. Also consider the individuals or groups affected by its use. Based on this information, you can accurately assign the appropriate role to each identified organization.</p>&#13;

<p>Beyond the requirements<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI development lifecycle" data-type="indexterm" id="ai-dev-lc-1"/> and obligations<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="EU AI Act" data-secondary="AI development lifecycle integration" data-seealso="AI development lifecycle" data-type="indexterm" id="id541"/> mentioned in the previous sections, the EU AI Act (along with other regulations on AI systems) introduces additional compliance considerations, particularly regarding transparency, risk management, and data governance. It is crucial to incorporate AI engineering efforts into every phase of the AI product lifecycle, especially when developing high-risk AI systems. As pictured in <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_4_figure_5_1748539919001734">Figure 4-5</a>, the level of engineering engagement and compliance effort tends to increase as a project progresses from ideation and proof of concept to the minimum viable product (MVP) stage, affecting development time, costs, and risk management. By integrating these efforts early in the development process—i.e., adopting a “shift-left” philosophy—teams can reduce risks and ensure that the final product is both technically robust and compliant with evolving AI regulations.</p>&#13;

<p>The introduction of the EU AI Act has had various implications with regard to AI system development:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ol>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>AI engineering and compliance tasks become more complex as the project progresses from ideation to MVP. As the system matures, the need for robust MLOps processes and governance increases. Many AI engineering tasks, such as implementing robust data pipelines and model monitoring, directly contribute to meeting EU AI Act compliance requirements by ensuring data quality and system reliability.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Data governance becomes increasingly important in later stages, helping to ensure data quality and regulatory compliance.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Human oversight mechanisms become more sophisticated in later stages, in line with the EU AI Act’s requirement for oversight of high-risk AI systems.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Risk assessment and management transition from high-level considerations in the early stages to comprehensive, continuous, and automated processes in the later stages.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>As the project progresses, there’s a greater emphasis on automating processes and ensuring scalability, particularly within MLOps tasks.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>At the MVP stage, the focus shifts toward preparing for audits and conformity assessments, reflecting the regulatory requirements for high-risk AI systems under the EU AI Act<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI development lifecycle" data-startref="ai-dev-lc-1" data-type="indexterm" id="id547"/>.</p>&#13;

<h1>Emerging Roles in Organizations for EU AI Act Compliance</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As mentioned previously, the operationalization of EU AI Act compliance happens on two levels: the organizational level and the AI system level. I focus on the former in <a data-type="link" href="app04.html#appendix_d_emerging_roles_in_organizations_for_eu_ai_act_comp_1748539915764930">Appendix D</a>, but I want to briefly touch on the topic here as well.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>With the rapid adoption of AI, several new roles are emerging within organizations to help ensure compliance with the EU AI Act. Some of these roles should be incorporated into machine learning teams to ensure that ethical and compliance aspects are fully integrated into the AI development process. Adopting a Team Topologies perspective provides a concrete framework for meeting the Act’s compliance <span class="keep-together">requirements</span>, ensuring that proper data governance is embedded throughout the ML development lifecycle. For further discussion of emerging roles and the implications of EU AI Act compliance for ML teams, see <a data-type="link" href="app04.html#appendix_d_emerging_roles_in_organizations_for_eu_ai_act_comp_1748539915764930">Appendix D</a>.</p>&#13;

<h1>Conclusion</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The chapter explored the initial steps of creating an AI system landscape and classifying AI systems in the context of achieving compliance with the EU AI Act. To determine the specific requirements for your organization, you will need to identify the AI systems that are currently deployed and intended to be put into production and classify each of them based on risk level. You’ll also need to determine whether the organization is acting as a provider or deployer of these AI systems, because the obligations differ depending on the role.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In the next chapter, I will cover the requirements for high-risk AI systems as outlined by the EU AI Act and how to implement them. Key topics will include the need for high-quality datasets, comprehensive documentation and recordkeeping, transparency, robustness and accuracy, security, risk management systems, human oversight, addressing ethical concerns and bias mitigation, monitoring in production, pre-market compliance verification, and maintaining continuous compliance for high-risk AI systems.</p>&#13;
