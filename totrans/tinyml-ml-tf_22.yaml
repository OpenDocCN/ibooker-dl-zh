- en: The Arduino IDE requires source files to be packaged in a certain way. The TensorFlow
    Lite for Microcontrollers Makefile knows how to do this for you, and can generate
    a *.zip* file containing all the source, which you can import into the Arduino
    IDE as a library. This will allow you to build and deploy your application.

- en: Instructions on generating this file appear later in this section. However,
    the easiest way to get started is to use a [prebuilt *.zip* file](https://oreil.ly/blgB8)
    that is generated nightly by the TensorFlow team.

- en: After you’ve downloaded that file, you need to import it. In the Arduino IDE’s
    Sketch menu, select Include Library→Add .ZIP Library, as shown in [Figure A-1](#arduino_add_zip_library).

    made changes to the code in the TensorFlow Git repository that you’d like to test
    out in the Arduino environment.

- en: You can then import this *.zip* file into the Arduino IDE using the steps documented
    earlier. If you’ve previously installed the library, you’ll need to remove the
    original version first. You can do this by deleting the *tensorflow_lite* directory
    from the Arduino IDE’s *libraries* directory, which you can find under “Sketchbook
    location” in the IDE’s Preferences window.
