<h1><span class="label">Chapter 5. </span>AI Engineering for High-Risk AI Systems</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This chapter explores the comprehensive requirements for high-risk AI systems and how to meet them proactively by implementing AI engineering practices to ensure compliance with the EU AI Act (see <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_5_figure_1_1748539922504826">Figure 5-1</a> for a visual of the steps to take to move toward compliance). In the previous chapter, I introduced the foundational steps for compliance: creating an inventory of current and planned AI systems, identifying the risk category of each, and determining whether your organization acts as a provider or deployer of these systems. These steps are essential for understanding which systems fall under the high-risk category and what compliance obligations need to be addressed.</p>&#13;

<p>Two guiding questions to consider in this chapter are:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>To comply with the EU AI Act, what requirements must high-risk AI systems <span class="keep-together">fulfill?</span></p>&#13;

	<li>&#13;
	<p>What processes, structures, and AI engineering practices need to be established to comply with the EU AI Act?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s start by exploring the requirements for high-risk AI systems, translating them into AI engineering practices, and defining the notion of AI engineering for the EU AI Act in this way.</p>&#13;

<p>As mentioned previously, the author is not a lawyer, and this book does not provide legal advice. The intersection of law and artificial intelligence is a complex subject that requires expertise beyond the scope of AI, data science, and machine learning. Legal considerations surrounding AI systems can be complex and far-reaching. If you have any legal concerns related to the AI systems you are working on, seek professional legal advice from qualified experts in the field.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="AI Engineering for the EU AI Act" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="chapter_5_ai_engineering_for_the_eu_ai_act_1748539922576762">&#13;
<h1>AI Engineering for the EU AI Act</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The EU AI Act regulates the development, deployment, and use of AI systems within the European Union. It aims to promote trustworthy AI by mitigating risks and protecting fundamental rights. As depicted in <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_5_figure_2_1748539922504869">Figure 5-2</a>, Articles 9–15 provide requirements for providers of high-risk AI systems. However, these articles do not provide technical guidance for implementing compliance.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This chapter suggests a method for technical implementation of compliance with the EU AI Act by aligning the Act’s articles with the quality model for safety-critical AI systems outlined in the paper <a href="https://oreil.ly/2J89P">“Navigating the EU AI Act: A Methodological Approach to Compliance for Safety-Critical Products”</a> by <span class="keep-together">Jessica</span> Kelly et al., presented at the 2024 IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CAI). The authors propose an expanded product quality model for AI systems, drawing from established standards such as ISO/IEC 25059. This enhanced model includes additional attributes relevant to the EU AI Act, such as ethical integrity, human oversight, and fairness.</p>&#13;
&#13;

</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Mapping EU AI Act requirements to quality attributes<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="quality attributes (for AI systems)" data-type="indexterm" id="id548"/> for AI systems is a helpful approach for several reasons, including:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Operationalization of regulatory requirements</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The EU AI Act provides high-level regulatory guidelines, which can be abstract and challenging to implement directly. By mapping these requirements to specific quality attributes, we create a more concrete, actionable framework for compliance. This helps translate legal language into technical specifications that engineers and data scientists can work with.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Integration with existing practices</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Quality attributes are well-established software and systems engineering concepts. Mapping EU AI Act requirements to these attributes facilitates the integration of regulatory compliance into existing development processes and quality assurance practices. This allows organizations to leverage familiar tools, methodologies, and metrics.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Alignment with standards</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Many quality attributes are defined by international standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 25010). Mapping EU AI Act requirements to these attributes helps align regulatory compliance with established standards, potentially simplifying overall compliance efforts.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In short, the mapping of EU AI Act articles to the quality attributes provides technical guidance for achieving compliance. <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_5_figure_3_1748539922504896">Figure 5-3</a> provides a high-level overview of this mapping.</p>&#13;

<h2>Goals</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="fix_tracking">Before we discuss the method, let’s explore what AI engineering for the EU AI Act involves. This multidisciplinary field focuses on designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining artificial intelligence systems in full compliance with the requirements of the Act. It combines expertise in AI technology, software engineering, data science, law, and ethics in order to achieve the following goals:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Implement technical measures ensuring compliance with the Act’s requirements, including risk assessment, transparency, human oversight, and robustness.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Develop methodologies for continuous monitoring and auditing of AI systems throughout their lifecycle.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Create documentation and traceability mechanisms to demonstrate compliance and facilitate regulatory inspections.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Integrate privacy-enhancing technologies and data governance practices aligned with EU data protection laws.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Design user interfaces and operational protocols that enable effective human oversight and intervention.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Alignment with CRISP-ML(Q) Phases" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="chapter_5_alignment_with_crisp_ml_q_phases_1748539922576892">&#13;
<h2>Alignment with CRISP-ML(Q) Phases</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To establish effective engineering processes, we’ll align the quality attributes of safety-critical (i.e., high-risk) AI systems with the phases of the CRISP-ML(Q) development process model introduced in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#chapter_2_ai_engineering_a_proactive_compliance_catalyst_1748539917637495">Chapter 2</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A core principle of CRISP-ML(Q) is the integration of quality assurance practices into each phase of the machine learning lifecycle. This includes defining system requirements, identifying potential risks, and applying risk mitigation strategies based on established best practices. As such, this model provides a suitable framework for integrating the quality attributes essential to safety-critical AI systems. As discussed previously, these attributes can be mapped directly to regulatory requirements such as those defined in the EU AI Act. Addressing them throughout the development lifecycle supports <em>continuous compliance</em>, rather than treating compliance as a one-time task.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As you already know, CRISP-ML(Q) defines six key phases in the ML development process: business and data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring and maintenance. It’s an iterative framework, where each phase consists of specific tasks (such as dataset cleaning or model training) and outputs (such as datasets or model artifacts). Many quality attributes relate directly to potential risks. By considering these attributes in each development phase, you can identify and address risks early, when changes are less costly and more feasible to implement. In this chapter, I align the CRISP-ML(Q) phases with the quality attributes linked to EU AI Act requirements to establish AI engineering best practices that support robust implementation and sustained compliance.</p>&#13;

<h1>AI Engineering Practices for Achieving Compliance</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The requirements for providers of high-risk AI systems are distributed across several articles in the EU AI Act. For your convenience, I’ve included them here as condensed action points:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Establish a risk management system that spans the entire AI system lifecycle.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Ensure strong data governance by validating and testing datasets to guarantee their relevance, representativeness, and accuracy in relation to the system’s intended purpose.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Create comprehensive technical documentation to demonstrate compliance and provide authorities with the necessary information for assessment.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Enable automatic logging capabilities in the AI system to track serious incidents and substantial modifications throughout its lifecycle.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Provide detailed instructions for downstream deployers to support compliance.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Incorporate human oversight mechanisms into the system’s design for downstream deployers.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Ensure the system meets standards for accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Establish a quality management system to support and maintain compliance. The requirements for this system are laid out in <a href="https://oreil.ly/zAKkT">Article 17</a>.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In the remainder of this chapter we will explore Articles 9–15 of the EU AI Act, which lay out the requirements for providers of high-risk AI systems, and see how these legal requirements translate into actionable AI engineering practices.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>To meet the requirements of Article 9 and ensure that high-risk AI systems are developed responsibly, organizations need to implement AI engineering processes that address three quality attributes<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="quality attributes (for AI systems)" data-type="indexterm" id="id549"/> throughout the AI system lifecycle. As identified by the paper I referenced earlier, <a href="https://oreil.ly/2J89P">“Navigating the EU AI Act: A Methodological Approach to Compliance for Safety-Critical Products”</a> by Jessica Kelly et al., these are:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Risk identification</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>This involves proactively recognizing potential issues that could arise from the AI system’s development, deployment, and operation. Implementing robust risk identification processes ensures that risks are managed before they become critical problems.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Testability</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>This ensures that the AI system can be thoroughly evaluated for performance, reliability, and safety before deployment.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Value alignment</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>This ensures that the AI system’s objectives and behaviors are consistent with human values, ethical principles, and societal norms.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s see how we can translate these quality attributes into AI engineering practices. I’ll use the CRISP-ML(Q) phases as a framework to tackle the complexity of the end-to-end process, considering each phase separately.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="1. Business and data understanding" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="chapter_5_section_1_business_and_data_understanding_1748539922577710">&#13;
<h3>1. Business and data understanding</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The initial phase of the AI project focuses on establishing clear business goals and defining success criteria to ensure the application delivers business value. This involves pinpointing the specific objectives of the AI solution, identifying relevant data sources, and assembling an initial dataset. Practically speaking, conducting an AI system risk assessment during this phase involves three steps: identifying potential risks, assessing the impact and likelihood of those risks, and assigning appropriate mitigation strategies to responsible parties.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Consider conducting workshops with stakeholders to identify possible risks. You might also want to use established AI risk frameworks, such as the IEEE AI Ethics Guidelines. Questions to ask include:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>What could go wrong with the data (e.g., bias, privacy breaches)?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>What operational risks could occur (e.g., concept drift, service downtime, poor model performance)?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>What regulatory risks are relevant (e.g., GDPR or EU AI Act noncompliance)?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<section class="pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="Failure Mode and Effects Analysis" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="chapter_5_failure_mode_and_effects_analysis_1748539922577786">&#13;
<h4 class="less_space">Failure Mode and Effects Analysis</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As part of a proactive risk management strategy, you should conduct <em>Failure Mode and Effects Analysis</em> (FMEA) tailored<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)" data-type="indexterm" id="fmea-1"/> to AI systems. This systematic process used to identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with potential failure points in a system is especially valuable in safety-critical environments. It enables teams to anticipate and prioritize risks before they impact users or system performance. Incorporating FMEA into your continuous delivery pipelines and model monitoring workflows during the later stages of CRISP-ML(Q) supports ongoing compliance and minimizes operational risk.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Conducting FMEA for AI systems involves the following steps:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>1. Identify potential failure modes.</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Consider AI-specific failures such as data quality issues (e.g., missing values, outliers), model underfitting or overfitting, concept drift or data drift, adversarial attacks, bias in predictions, explainability failures, performance degradation over time, resource constraints (e.g., memory, computation time), and integration failures with other systems.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>2. Determine potential effects.</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>For each failure mode, identify potential consequences, such as incorrect predictions leading to poor decision making, biased outcomes affecting specific groups, privacy breaches, financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory <span class="keep-together">noncompliance</span>.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>3. Identify potential causes.</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>For each failure mode, determine possible root causes, such as insufficient or biased training data, poor feature selection, suboptimal hyperparameter tuning, inadequate model architecture, errors in data preprocessing, use of personal data without appropriate consent, and changes in the deployment environment.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>4. Assess current controls.</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Evaluate existing measures to prevent or detect each failure mode. These might include data validation checks, model performance monitoring, automated testing procedures, human-in-the-loop oversight, and explainability techniques.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;

<h4>Testability and value alignment</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In addition to risk identification and mitigation, it’s essential to establish clear, measurable objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs) that the AI system must meet. This includes creating a comprehensive plan outlining how each component and the system as a whole will be tested.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It’s also important to clearly outline the ethical guidelines and principles that the AI system must adhere to, such as fairness and transparency. One practical tool that you can use for this<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Value Canvas" data-type="indexterm" id="id551"/> is the <a href="https://oreil.ly/c79Xu">Values Canvas</a>, a template for developing ethical AI strategies and documenting existing ethics efforts.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Be sure to involve internal and external stakeholders in these processes, to understand their values, expectations, and needs. Internal stakeholders may include data scientists, MLOps engineers, legal teams, product managers, and executives, while external stakeholders can include regulators, customers, partners, and auditors. To categorize and prioritize stakeholders based on their level of influence and interest in the AI system<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Power–Interest Grid" data-type="indexterm" id="id552"/>, use the <a href="https://oreil.ly/CGtNw">Power–Interest Grid</a>.</p>&#13;

<h3>2. Data preparation</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When conducting risk identification, it’s vital to assess the quality of the data being used. This includes identifying risks related to data quality, such as missing values, inconsistencies, and potential biases. Typical MLOps practices involve automating data validation and profiling using frameworks like Great Expectations or Deequ that can automatically detect issues like these.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Data quality pipelines should also incorporate unit tests to monitor drift and data integrity in real time. Make sure to write unit tests for the data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes in the data pipelines to ensure any issues with data handling are caught early. To ensure effective testability, implement scripts to automatically validate the integrity and quality of the data.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Regarding value alignment, when curating data, it’s important to ensure that the dataset represents the necessary diversity to prevent biased outcomes. MLOps practices should integrate ethical checks, such as ensuring that no discriminatory proxies are used in feature engineering. To implement ethical checks, integrate tools like SHAP, Fairlearn, Great Expectations, and EvidentlyAI into your MLOps pipelines.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For example, the data pipeline might look like this:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ol>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Data ingestion</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Quality checks (Great Expectations)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Correlation analysis for proxy detection</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Additionally, privacy preservation techniques such as data minimization or anonymization via advanced techniques like differential privacy should be applied to align with ethical standards.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="3. Modeling" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="chapter_5_section_3_modeling_1748539922577959">&#13;
<h3>3. Modeling</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Risk identification in the modeling phase involves evaluating the risks associated with different modeling approaches, such as overfitting and underfitting.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To incorporate testability into your model code, consider using automated testing frameworks such as pytest for unit tests. Implementing cross-validation techniques can help ensure that your model generalizes well across different datasets and <span class="keep-together">scenarios</span>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>With regard to value alignment, it’s important to select algorithms that align with ethical considerations—for example, you should use interpretable models for high-stakes decisions. Additionally, metrics should be incorporated into the model to assess and address biases in model predictions. Collaborate with stakeholders to determine the values you want to uphold (e.g., fairness, robustness, interpretability) and define specific metrics, such as:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Fairness</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Demographic parity, equal opportunity</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Robustness</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Tolerance to noisy inputs, resilience to adversarial examples</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Integrating relevant tools into the pipeline can help ensure continuous alignment with ethical values throughout the product lifecycle and compliance with the requirements of the EU AI Act. Here are some recommendations:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>MLOps tools: MLflow, Airflow, DVC, Kubeflow, TensorFlow Extended (TFX)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Fairness tools: Fairlearn, AI Fairness 360</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Monitoring tools: EvidentlyAI for drift detection</p>&#13;

<h3>4. Evaluation</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Next, let’s consider how the quality attributes that Article 9 maps to can be implemented in the evaluation phase of the CRISP-ML(Q) model.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Risk identification" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="chapter_5_risk_identification_1748539922578071">&#13;
<h4>Risk identification</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Performing model interpretability analysis during the evaluation phase helps identify unexpected or undesirable model behaviors. You can use tools like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), or InterpretML to generate explanations.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When analyzing the results, look for features that are unexpectedly high in importance and counterintuitive feature interactions. Check for proxy variables that might inadvertently introduce bias. Document your findings in a structured report detailing unexpected behaviors and their potential impacts, hypotheses for the causes of these behaviors, and proposed mitigations. Also include key features influencing the model in this report.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To further uncover risks and ensure testability, conduct adversarial testing<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="adversarial testing" data-type="indexterm" id="id553"/> using libraries such as the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART), PyRIT, or CleverHans. Tailor your approach to the model type, deployment mode, and model exposure strategy.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">Relevant types of adversarial attacks might include:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Evasion attacks (e.g., Fast Gradient Sign Method, Carlini &amp; Wagner)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Poisoning attacks (e.g., label flipping, backdoor insertion)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Model extraction attacks</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Document your findings regarding the model’s vulnerability to different types of attacks and classify them based on severity and likelihood. You can use this not only for recordkeeping but as a “thinking tool” to develop mitigation strategies such as adversarial training or input preprocessing.</p>&#13;

<h4>Testability</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>AI systems are always embedded in larger software systems, which are often legacy systems with complex interdependencies. Therefore, comprehensive test suites are needed to ensure that the AI components integrate reliably and function as expected. These should include:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p><em>Unit tests</em> to validate individual components of the ML pipeline (e.g., data preprocessing, feature engineering)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p><em>Integration tests </em>to ensure that the AI system component interacts correctly with other parts of the system</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p><em>System tests</em> to evaluate the AI system in a production-like environment (including performance testing, load testing, and error handling)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p><em>A/B testing </em>in controlled environments to validate performance, demonstrate the business impact of changes to the model, enable incremental rollouts, and detect issues early</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>From a compliance perspective, A/B testing can help verify that a new model maintains or improves fairness metrics across different user groups in a real-world setting. It aids in demonstrating due diligence in model deployment, which is crucial for regulatory compliance under the EU AI Act.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="less_space">5. Deployment</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The next stage is to deploy your AI system in production. Let’s look at deployment through the lens of the three quality attributes that are relevant to Article 9.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Risk identification" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="chapter_5_risk_identification_1748539922578289">&#13;
<h4>Risk identification</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You’ll first want to implement vulnerability scanning to identify security risks. The <a href="https://oreil.ly/Ks7Jt">OWASP Machine Learning Security Top 10</a> is a good reference<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OWASP Machine Learning Security Top 10" data-type="indexterm" id="id554"/> for understanding common security issues, vulnerabilities, and risks associated with machine learning systems. You might also use tools like OWASP ZAP or Nessus to scan for common vulnerabilities such as:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Input manipulation attacks (ML01:2023)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Data poisoning attacks (ML02:2023)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Model inversion attacks (ML03:2023)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Membership inference attacks (ML04:2023)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Model theft (ML05:2023)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>AI supply chain attacks (ML06:2023)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Transfer learning attacks (ML07:2023)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Model skewing (ML08:2023)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Output integrity attacks (ML09:2023)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Model poisoning (ML10:2023)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Additionally, the following AI incident and risk trackers<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI incident and risk trackers" data-type="indexterm" id="id555"/> can help you stay informed about the current developments and keep your AI security strategy up-to-date:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/4vrn_">AI Risk Repository</a></p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/8dyrm">AI Incident Database</a></p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/tVVZ1">OECD AI Incidents and Hazards Monitor</a></p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Another important<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="penetration testing" data-type="indexterm" id="id556"/> pre-deployment activity is manual or automated penetration testing. Penetration testing helps identify ML vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. It’s essential for AI systems handling sensitive data or intellectual property. Tools like Metasploit and Burp Suite can be used to test various attack vectors. Compliance with the EU AI Act requires demonstrable security measures, and regular penetration testing, continuous monitoring, and incident response planning should be part of a comprehensive security strategy for AI systems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Perform a security-focused code review of the deployment scripts and infrastructure-as-code, and assess operational risks in the production environment. You can evaluate the reliability and scalability of your cloud or on-premises infrastructure using tools like AWS Trusted Advisor or Azure Advisor. To mitigate supply chain risks, analyze all dependencies for known vulnerabilities in the <a href="https://oreil.ly/euMDH">National Vulnerability Database</a>. Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and GitHub Dependabot are good starting points.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>During deployment, you should also plan for disaster recovery. Develop and test backup and restore procedures for data, models, and pipeline artifacts, and implement and validate failover mechanisms for critical components in the ML system.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Testability" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="chapter_5_testability_1748539922578343">&#13;
<h4>Testability</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Testability in the deployment phase hinges on AI system observability, including implementing continuous monitoring and alerting systems. The initial step is to establish key metrics that offer a holistic view of the AI system. Your metrics categories should include:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, latency)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>System health metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Business metrics (e.g., number of predictions, error rates)</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Once the metrics are defined, set up alerting by defining appropriate thresholds. You can use tools like Prometheus with Alertmanager or CloudWatch Alarms to implement alerting based on predefined conditions.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You might also want to implement API testing, automated regression testing, and data and model validation tests to detect drift. You can use tools like Deepchecks, a holistic open source solution for AI and ML validation.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Value alignment" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="chapter_5_value_alignment_1748539922578394">&#13;
<h4>Value alignment</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To implement continuous value alignment checks, regularly assess model outputs against defined ethical guidelines (examples of ethical metrics are demographic parity, equal opportunity, and representation balance). A useful way to identify these ethical values is to apply the Foundational Value Finder Framework, as outlined in Olivia Gambelin’s book <a href="https://oreil.ly/hmXoe"><em>Responsible AI</em></a>. It unites the government, industry, and organizational ethical value sets.</p>&#13;

<h3>6. Monitoring and maintenance</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To implement the quality attributes associated with Article 9 during the monitoring and maintenance phase, several key tasks need to be addressed.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Risk identification involves continuously monitoring for data drift and model performance degradation using automated tools. Update the AI system’s risk register regularly to reflect new insights gathered from operational usage. Risks should be categorized across technical, operational, ethical, and regulatory domains.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To ensure testability, periodic audits of model performance, system behavior, and fairness metrics are important. Introduce chaos engineering techniques, such as <span class="keep-together">simulating</span> data corruption, resource exhaustion, or network failures, to identify system vulnerabilities.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Maintaining value alignment requires regular reviews and updates of ethical guidelines and periodic stakeholder reviews to assess alignment between stakeholder expectations and system behavior.</p>&#13;

<p>As you may recall from <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#chapter_3_data_and_ai_governance_and_ai_engineering_1748539918115723">Chapter 3</a>, at its core, data governance ensures high data quality throughout the machine learning lifecycle, supports business objectives, and enables organization-wide data use by focusing on availability, usability, consistency, integrity, security, and compliance. That chapter also outlined data governance <span class="keep-together">processes</span> for each stage of the CRISP-ML(Q) framework, providing a practical approach to managing data responsibly across the development lifecycle that supports the creation of AI systems that are trustworthy, compliant, and sustainable.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since Article 10 of the EU AI Act provides only a high-level explanation of the requirements regarding data and data governance, let’s break down the quality attributes that support a comprehensive framework for implementing trustworthy AI through MLOps practices. In “Navigating the EU AI Act,” Kelly et al. map Article 10 to 13 quality attributes  for high-risk AI systems. These are:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Independence</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The extent to which datasets used for training, validation, and testing are isolated and unaffected by each other, preventing data leakage across sets.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Data completeness</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The extent to which the dataset contains all necessary data points and variables to support accurate predictions, covering the full range of use cases and features relevant to the AI system’s purpose.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Currentness</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The degree to which the data is up-to-date and temporally relevant for its intended use case.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Data fairness</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The absence of bias, prejudice, or favoritism toward individuals or groups in the data, particularly in relation to protected characteristics.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Precision</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The level of exactness or granularity in the data measurements and representations.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Representativeness</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The extent to which the data and its distribution reflects the characteristics of the real-world population or scenario it is intended to model.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Consistency</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The uniformity of data (the degree to which it maintains its format, structure, and values) across the entire dataset and over time.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Accuracy</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The closeness of data values to their true or accepted real-world values.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Credibility</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The trustworthiness of the data sources and collection methods.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Temporality</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The degree to which the temporal characteristics of the data, including timeliness, aging, versioning, and lifecycle management, ensure its ongoing relevance and appropriateness. This is important for understanding how data changes over time and for making decisions based on current information.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Confidentiality</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The protection of sensitive information in accordance with privacy requirements and data protection regulations.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Compliance</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The degree to which data practices conform to applicable legal, ethical, and organizational standards and regulations.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Data traceability</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The ability to track data from its origin through its entire lifecycle, including all transformations, access points, and uses, supporting transparency, accountability, and auditability.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The quality attributes associated with Article 10 are distributed throughout the CRISP-ML(Q) lifecycle. <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_5_table_3_1748539922529427">Table 5-3</a> maps these attributes to each development phase and highlights practical AI engineering practices for implementing them<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="quality attributes (for AI systems)" data-secondary="associated with Article 10: Data and Data Governance" data-type="indexterm" id="id560"/>.</p>&#13;

<h1>Article 11</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/8TJP3">Article 11 of the EU AI Act</a> mandates comprehensive technical documentation for high-risk AI systems, ensuring transparency, traceability, and accountability throughout their lifecycle. This requirement helps stakeholders and regulators verify a system’s safety, compliance, and performance.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Key points of Article 11 include<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Article 11: Technical Documentation" data-secondary="key points of" data-type="indexterm" id="id563"/>:</p>&#13;

<p>According to Kelly et al., Article 11 maps to one key quality attribute: traceability. Documenting AI models is a central requirement of the EU AI Act, particularly as a means of assessing legal compliance. Both technical and quality management system documentation are critical components in the conformity assessment process.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For downstream providers incorporating a preexisting AI model into an AI system, a comprehensive understanding of the model and its functionalities is essential, both to facilitate the integration into their offerings and to ensure they fulfill their responsibilities under the EU AI Act and other applicable regulations (<a href="https://oreil.ly/kB5Pj">Recital 101</a>). As such, the creator of the AI model is required to provide comprehensive technical documentation to downstream providers (<a href="https://oreil.ly/Xn8iw">Article 53(1b)</a>).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>MLOps and documentation are closely related, as documentation plays a critical role in the lifecycle of machine learning (ML) projects and is essential for operationalizing models effectively. For example, documentation captures details about data preprocessing, feature engineering, model configurations, hyperparameters, and environment settings, enabling others (or the same team at a later time) to reproduce experiments and results reliably.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Furthermore, MLOps involves tracking all stages of the ML workflow—data preparation, model training, testing, deployment, and monitoring. Documenting each stage, including data sources, code versions, and model changes, supports traceability and accountability, which are vital for auditability, especially in regulated sectors. More importantly, robust documentation is essential for meeting regulatory standards, including the data protection and transparency requirements outlined in the EU AI Act.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>What’s more, according to DORA’s <a href="https://oreil.ly/sjTX3">2023 Accelerate State of DevOps Report</a>, high-quality documentation has been linked to a 25% increase in team performance.</p>&#13;

<h3>Technical documentation requirements</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Article 11 outlines the requirements for the technical documentation of high-risk AI systems, although related obligations are found throughout Articles 8–15.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch05.html#id564" id="id564-marker">1</a></sup> These requirements apply to both datasets and AI systems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Technical documentation serves two primary purposes: providing instructions for users of the system and demonstrating regulatory compliance to authorities. As such, the intended audience spans technical teams, compliance teams (AI auditors and conformity assessment bodies), and end users. <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_5_table_4_1748539922529451">Table 5-4</a> outlines the relevant <span class="keep-together">technical</span> information elements under the EU AI Act.

<p>Technical documentation for high-risk AI systems is a legal requirement and must be created prior to placing the systems on the market or putting them into service. It is essential to keep this documentation updated, as it serves to demonstrate compliance to regulatory authorities. Furthermore, it plays a crucial role in conformity assessment procedures, ensuring that all requirements are met. The documentation must be detailed enough to show compliance with all applicable regulations. Ultimately, it serves the needs of both users and regulatory authorities, providing transparency and assurance in the use of high-risk AI systems.</p>&#13;

<h3>Managing documentation debt</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Documentation debt</em> refers<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="documentation debt" data-type="indexterm" id="id566"/> to the accumulated costs and risks associated with incomplete, outdated, inconsistent, or missing documentation across the dataset, data processing, and AI system lifecycle. Organizations can minimize this debt by automating documentation generation as part of ML pipeline execution, taking care to capture the following elements:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Data quality metrics and validation results</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Data lineage and transformation steps</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Feature definitions and characteristics</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Pipeline metadata, including execution parameters, data statistics and profiling, validation results, transformed datasets, evaluation metrics, and training logs</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Model versions, hyperparameters, and training outcomes</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Another essential aspect of operationalizing documentation is applying version control to key documentation assets such as feature definitions and schemas, model documentation (such as model cards), ML pipeline configurations and parameters, training datasets, feature stores, data transformations, and preprocessing steps. Documentation versions should be tracked alongside code versions using Git-based version control systems, artifact repositories, model registries, and feature stores with versioning capabilities.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>By automating these processes and utilizing appropriate tools and platforms, organizations can establish a robust documentation system that is integrated into their MLOps practices. This reduces manual effort, improves consistency, and helps ensure the AI system’s ongoing compliance with the EU AI Act.</p>&#13;

<p>When selecting a documentation framework, it is essential to choose one that aligns with your organization’s specific needs and regulatory obligations. In practice, the most effective approach often involves combining multiple complementary documentation methods to ensure thorough coverage while maintaining usability. AI Factsheets and AI Cards currently offer the most comprehensive support, but organizations may benefit from supplementing them with more specialized tools, such as datasheets for datasets and model cards. Taking a “layered documentation” approach is a useful strategy, where the AI Cards framework is used for high-level system documentation, component-specific details are captured through datasheets and model cards, and greater technical depth is provided by using AI Factsheets.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Implementing machine-readable specifications that integrate with existing metadata management systems is crucial. This enables automated documentation generation, streamlining the process and improving consistency and efficiency. Finally, it’s important to adapt the level of detail in documentation to suit different audiences (technical teams, compliance teams, and end users)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Article 11: Technical Documentation" data-startref="art-11-techdoc-1" data-type="indexterm" id="id568"/>.</p>&#13;

As you’ve seen, Article 11 outlines comprehensive documentation requirements covering overall system design, technical specifications, development processes, and risk and quality management measures. Article 12 focuses specifically on the automatic recording of events and activities, capturing operational logs, behavioral data, and runtime information. In the context of compliance, technical documentation provides the framework for what needs to be recorded, while recordkeeping provides the operational evidence that the AI system performs in accordance with that documentation. <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_5_table_7_1748539922529522">Table 5-7</a> shows the correspondence between technical documentation and runtime recordkeeping elements.</p>&#13;

<p>Metadata systems are often overlooked or deprioritized, but they are key components of any data and ML platform for operationalizing documentation requirements and maintaining compliance with the EU AI Act. A well-designed metadata system provides the foundation for systematic documentation management, supports automation and quality control, and enables organizations to demonstrate compliance to regulatory authorities. To ensure effectiveness, organizations should treat metadata systems as integral to their data and AI governance infrastructure and periodically conduct internal test audits to verify that key information is easily accessible when needed.</p>&#13;

<h1>Conclusion</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This chapter has explored the intersection of the EU AI Act and AI engineering, presenting a framework for achieving and demonstrating compliance through robust engineering practices. As you have seen, data and AI governance, monitoring, alerting, and documentation are not merely best practices but foundational elements for compliance with the EU AI Act.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We examined Articles 9 through 15 of the Act here, translating their high-level requirements for high-risk AI systems into actionable technical specifications aligned with the CRISP-ML(Q) lifecycle. By mapping these requirements to relevant quality attributes for safety-critical AI systems, this chapter provides a practical roadmap for organizations to develop, deploy, and manage high-risk AI systems responsibly and transparently. (See <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_5_table_13_1748539922529689">Table 5-13</a> for the complete mapping.) A key takeaway is the central role of documentation in assessing and demonstrating compliance. A robust metadata management system is also essential, both for meeting the documentation requirements of Article 11 and for ensuring traceability, as mandated by Article 12.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>AI governance is an emerging discipline, and its implementation varies across industries. Consequently, achieving compliance with the EU AI Act presents real challenges, and there is a need for an engineering-level approach to meet the Act’s requirements. This chapter, along with the previous ones, represents an initial effort to establish principles for proactive compliance through comprehensive AI engineering practices—practices that serve as enablers of trustworthy AI, which is the core motivation behind the EU AI Act.</p>&#13;

<p>The concept of AI engineering for the EU AI Act introduced here blends law, ethics, and MLOps, with an emphasis on continuous compliance through monitoring and documentation. In the next chapter, we will examine the requirements for limited-risk AI systems and explore strategies for proactive compliance through AI engineering in that context.</p>&#13;
