    you learned how to provide your AI chatbot application with up-to-date and relevant
    context. This enables your chatbot to generate accurate responses based on the
    user’s input. But that’s not enough to build a production-ready application. How
    can you enable your application to actually “chat” back and forth with the user,
    while remembering prior conversations and relevant context?

- en: Large language models are *stateless*, which means that each time the model
    is prompted to generate a new response it has no memory of the prior prompt or
    model response. In order to provide this historical information to the model,
    we need a robust memory system that will keep track of previous conversations
    and context. This historical information can then be included in the final prompt
    sent to the LLM, thus giving it “memory.” [Figure 4-1](#ch04_figure_1_1736545668257395)
    illustrates this.

    in, how many times each actor is called, and so on. To do this, we can model the
    interaction between the actors as happening across multiple discrete steps in
    time. When one actor hands off work to another actor, it results in the scheduling
    of the next step of the computation, and so on, until no more actors hand off
    work to others, and the final result is reached.

    state is a dictionary with a single key: `messages`. The `messages` key is annotated
    with the `add_messages` reducer function, which tells LangGraph to append new
    messages to the existing list, rather than overwrite it. State keys without an
    annotation will be overwritten by each update, storing the most recent value.
    You can write your own reducer functions, which are simply functions that receive

    being written to the state—and should return the next state, that is, the result

- en: This chapter covered the fundamentals of building a simple memory system that
    enables your AI chatbot to remember its conversations with a user. We discussed
    how to automate the storage and updating of chat history using LangGraph to make
    this easier. We also discussed the importance of modifying chat history and explored
    various strategies to trim, filter, and summarize chat messages.

    you’ll learn how to enable your AI chatbot to do more than just chat back: for
    instance, your new model will be able to make decisions, pick actions, and reflect
    on its past outputs.'
