    and deep learning—the two fields that we need to understand in order to get started
    with generative deep learning!'

- en: In [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#chapter_generative_modelling) we will define generative
    modeling and consider a toy example that we can use to understand some of the
    key concepts that are important to all generative models. We will also lay out
    the taxonomy of generative model families that we will explore in [Part II](part02.xhtml#part_methods)
    of this book.

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#chapter_deep_learning) provides a guide to the deep
    learning tools and techniques that we will need to start building more complex
    generative models. In particular, we will build our first example of a deep neural
    network—a multilayer perceptron (MLP)—using Keras. We will then adapt this to
    include convolutional layers and other improvements, to observe the difference
    in performance.'

    of the core concepts that underpin all of the techniques in later parts of the
    book.
