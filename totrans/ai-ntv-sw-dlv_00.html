<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>The software industry stands at a pivotal moment. Systems grow more complex by the day, user demands escalate exponentially, and the cost of failure, whether financial, reputational, or operational, has never been higher. Yet despite decades of progress, many teams remain shackled to outdated practices: manual deployments, reactive firefighting, and toolchains that crumble under their own complexity. This book exists to bridge the gap between where we are and where we need to be. It’s a map for navigating the shift from brittle, high-stakes delivery to AI-driven <span class="keep-together">autonomy—</span>a future where software deploys itself, systems self-heal, and innovation outpaces risk.</p>

<h1>Why We Wrote This Book</h1>

<p>As software engineers by training, we’ve spent years studying the evolution of software development and delivery. But OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 marked a pivotal moment for us. Like many in the field, we saw generative AI<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="generative AI (GenAI)" data-type="indexterm" id="id282"/> not just as a coding assistant but as a catalyst for reimagining entire delivery pipelines. Over the next three years, we hypothesized, tested, and validated how AI, from code generation to agentic workflows, would reshape deployment, testing, and governance.</p>

<p>We wrote this book because the stakes of software delivery have changed. The rise of microservices, cloud-native architectures, and AI-generated code<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-native software delivery" data-secondary="DevOps integration of" data-type="indexterm" id="id283"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="DevOps" data-type="indexterm" id="id284"/> has rendered traditional DevOps 1.0 practices insufficient. Teams now juggle 10+ tools in a single pipeline, battle “dependency hell,” and face threats like SolarWinds-style supply chain attacks, all while racing to meet user expectations forged by consumer tech giants.</p>

<p>Existing resources focus on historical DevOps concepts or speculate about AI in abstract terms. This book connects the dots. Grounded in 25 years of lessons, from Agile’s early wins to the Kubernetes orchestration revolution, we pair technical rigor with forward-looking insights. Modern tools exemplify this shift. We show how AI isn’t just automating tasks but reshaping collaboration, governance, and innovation.</p>

<p>Of course, the pace of change is relentless. Agentic AI, self-operating systems, and new frameworks emerge monthly. While we’ve strived to future-proof this book, we acknowledge that some details will evolve. What won’t change are the core principles: automating toil, prioritizing resilience, and aligning delivery with business value.</p>

<h1>Navigating This Book</h1>

<p>This book isn’t about chasing trends. It’s about building systems that thrive amid complexity. Each chapter blends theory with real-world examples, from <em>The Phoenix Project</em>’s DevOps parable to AI-driven deployment. Whether you read cover-to-cover or dive into specific sections, you’ll finish equipped to transform your delivery process and your team’s impact.</p>
