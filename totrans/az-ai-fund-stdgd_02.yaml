- en: Azure AI Services are packed with tools to help you automate tasks like language
    processing, image recognition, intelligent search, and content generation. What’s
    great is that you don’t need to be an AI expert to dive in. These services are
    easy to implement in both web and mobile apps, and with more than a dozen AI features
    available, you can use them on their own or mix them.

- en: One of the best things about Azure AI Services is that they come prebuilt and
    ready to go. Powered by Microsoft’s high-performance Azure platform, these pretrained
    ML models are accessible to businesses of all sizes. So whether you’re a small
    startup or a large enterprise, you can tap into years of Microsoft’s AI research
    without needing to be a tech wizard. While many tools work right out of the box,
    others—like Azure AI Vision, Azure AI Speech, and Azure OpenAI Service—can be
    fine-tuned with your own data to meet specific needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another cool feature is how easily you can plug Azure AI Services into your
    projects. Developers can access these tools through Representational State Transfer
    (REST) APIs or SDKs. *Application programming interfaces* *(APIs)* allow different
    software applications to connect and communicate with one another—imagine them
    as digital bridges between your applications. For example, when you book a flight
    online, the airline’s website uses an API to check available seats and prices
    from its database. Similarly, when a weather app fetches the latest forecast,
    it communicates with a weather service’s API to retrieve that data in real time.
    *Software development kits (SDKs)*, on the other hand, bundle all the tools, libraries,
    and documentation developers need to build apps for specific platforms. This makes
    the whole process smoother. Plus, Azure AI Services integrate with other Microsoft
    services like Azure Logic Apps and Power Automate. This makes Azure AI Services
    even more versatile.

    there are some limits. For instance, AI services like Azure Machine Learning and
    Cognitive Services are free for the first 12 months. With these, you can build,
    train, and deploy ML models or add AI features—such as speech, vision, and language—to
    your apps. You can try out services like Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics
    or Azure AI Vision during the trial period, all within the free usage limits.
