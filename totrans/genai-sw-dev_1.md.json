["```py\nGenerate code in JavaScript to solve the following challenge.\n\nContext:\n- We have one 2D array, filled with zeros and ones.\n- We have to find the starting point and ending point of all rectangles \nfilled with 0.\n- It is given that rectangles are separated and do not touch each other; \nhowever, they can touch the boundary of the array.\n- A rectangle might contain only one element.\n\nDesired output:\n- You should return an array, each element representing one rectangle.\n- Each of those array elements contains an array with 4 elements that \ncompose the rectangle (top left Y, top left X, bottom right Y, bottom right X).\n\nExample arrays:\ninput1 = [ [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], \n           [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], \n           [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], \n           [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], \n           [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], \n           [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], \n           [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], \n           [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] ]\n\ninput2 = [ [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], \n           [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], \n           [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], \n           [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], \n           [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], \n           [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], \n           [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], \n           [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0] ]\n```", "```py\nI want to build a to-do list app with these requirements:\n- The UI should be simple, with a Kanban board and a “New task” button\n- That “New task” button opens a modal to create a new note with a \nsimple textarea field\n- When a new task is added, the backend automatically pulls step-by-step\ninstructions using an API integration with OpenAI\n- All notes are stored in a database, each note has three fields: the \nuser-created task title, the instructions pulled from OpenAI, and \na timestamp\n```"]
