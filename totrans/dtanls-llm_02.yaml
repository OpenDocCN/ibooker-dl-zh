    start using it for data analysis. If you have never used ChatGPT, this chapter
    will teach you how to access it and give you a first impression of its capabilities
    (as well as its limitations). If you have used ChatGPT but have not yet done so
    for data analysis, this chapter will show you some of the many ways you can exploit
    ChatGPT in this context.

    ChatGPT. We will go over the OpenAI registration process, discuss the main functions
    offered by the interface, and use it to have a first dialogue with ChatGPT. After
    that, we will start using ChatGPT to analyze data in a few example scenarios.
    We will see two different ways to exploit ChatGPT for data analysis: directly
    and indirectly. When using ChatGPT directly, we have it do the actual data processing
    given data and a task description as input. This works for data types that ChatGPT
    processes natively (such as text data).'

- en: On the other hand, we can also use ChatGPT to analyze data indirectly. Here,
    ChatGPT merely serves as a translator, translating descriptions of analysis tasks
    into formal languages that are understood by external data-processing tools. The
    actual data processing is then handled by those external tools. In this chapter,
    you will see that ChatGPT is useful in both scenarios.

    OpenAI’s GPT model series. The examples discussed next should, in principle, work

    language model invents new content in the absence of information and integrates
    it into answers. Often the result sounds convincing, and it can be hard to recognize
    instances of hallucination. Ongoing research [1] explores methods to reduce the
    chances of hallucinations. However, at the time of writing, no reliable strategies
    to avoid hallucinations are known. So don’t blindly trust information from language

    on their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with specific Banana products. Users
    often point out specific aspects of these products that stand out or need improvement.
    In aggregate, all those reviews should be very helpful to inform the design of
    future Banana products! But to make that possible, you first need to analyze all
    of them and extract common points. Your boss asks you to do just that: prepare
    statistics that summarize reviews for different products and product categories.
    Also, while you’re reading through reviews, your boss encourages you to write
    a few nice replies to the product reviews. Ideally, you want to avoid spending
    the next weeks reading and aggregating reviews. Can’t you automate that? Perhaps
    ChatGPT can help.'

    The BananaBook is a fictitious device, and it’s not immediately clear what type

    and office work are most typically associated with personal computers (more so
    than with mobile phones or game consoles). Despite the uncertainty, ChatGPT can
    come up with a reasonable answer and justify it thoroughly. In this instance,
    the answer from ChatGPT is even more fine-grained than required: although ChatGPT
    links the review to one of the three provided categories, it additionally hypothesizes
    that the review refers to a laptop (a subcategory of personal computers). This

    does not really provide a benefit. We could have classified or summarized the
    review manually and done it much more quickly than with the help of ChatGPT. Of
    course, the goal of automation is to scale processing up to a large number of
    (possibly longer) reviews. If we’re talking about hundreds, perhaps thousands,
    of reviews, manual analysis will take much longer than setting up ChatGPT to do
    the task. But a crucial component is still missing: How do we inform ChatGPT about
    all the review text? Can we simply copy and paste the whole collection of reviews

    analysis. First, there are strict limits on the size of files we can upload (512
    MB at the time of writing). Uploading large data sets is not possible. Second,
    you may have noticed that data analysis with Python can take a few seconds, even
    for moderately sized data sets (e.g., the table with reviews has only 10,000 rows,
    which is small according to today’s standards). Analyzing large data sets takes
    prohibitive amounts of time. Finally, uploading data to OpenAI may not be acceptable
    for each use case. To preserve privacy for sensitive data, users may prefer analyzing
    data on their own platforms. In the next section, we will see how we can use ChatGPT
    to analyze data outside of OpenAI’s web interface.

    instead of applying ChatGPT directly to the data, we use it as a translation mechanism.
    In this case, we translate questions about the data (formulated in plain English)
    into SQL queries that we can then execute using a corresponding tool (an RDBMS
    in this scenario). In later chapters, we will also use it to translate to other
    formal languages.'

    Clearly, this approach is not the most convenient. In chapter 5, we will see how
    to build frameworks that automate all those steps.
