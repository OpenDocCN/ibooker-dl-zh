- en: The age of artificial intelligence is upon us. AI will have broad, sweeping
    implications that will affect nearly every aspect of our lives, including how
    users search for what they need online. Therefore, we must adapt how we perform
    search engine optimization (SEO) to get our brands in front of users. In this
    book, we’ll look beyond the hype and myths, instead focusing on the generative
    AI tools that exist today and how they can be used to substantially enhance your
    SEO program.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we’ll discuss why organic search remains one of the most valuable
    marketing channels at your disposal, why SEO is the key to optimizing the volume
    of traffic you get from that channel, and why generative AI tools won’t cause
    that to change. You’ll learn how the Google algorithm really works by taking a
    deep dive into [Google’s 2023 testimony to the United States Department of Justice
    (DOJ)](https://oreil.ly/0zo-N) and the [Google Content Warehouse API leak](https://oreil.ly/oGoa8),
    which became widely known in May 2024.

    held beliefs about how SEO works. Keep an open mind. This information will come
    in handy if you’re responsible for obtaining resources or budgets to execute SEO
    programs. It may help you educate and gain support from those who hold fast to
    outdated beliefs. Having a sound understanding of core parts of the Google algorithm
    will also better equip you to use generative AI as a tool to enhance your SEO
    efforts.

    or 99,000 queries per second. In addition, 53% of all clicks come from organic

    has lowered SEO traffic potential by 35%, but even with this reduction SEO remains
    a highly valuable channel. Therefore, SEO to put yourself ahead of your competitors

    high ROI. SEO ROI can be difficult to measure due to the delay in the time from
    when you implement technical or content SEO and when you see the benefits. This
    often takes three to six months. Note that conversion rates will vary significantly
    depending on the products or services offered by the site.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another reason that SEO ROI is high is there is no cost per action, or “sales
    cost.” For example, with pay-per-click (PPC) models, you pay for each click on
    your ad. Similarly, with display advertising, you pay for your ad placement (per
    impression, per click, or per action). As a result, there is a direct cost associated
    with each sale you make from your advertising, which you pay to third parties
    for your ad placements. That said, the advantage of these models is that they
    are “direct response” models, meaning that for every dollar you spend you can
    expect to receive some money back in the short term. The predictability of these
    models is high, and they can usually be tuned to drive revenue at a known level
    of ROI. The downside with direct response models, though, is that the competition
    for ad placements is very high because of how direct and immediate the response
    is, which drives prices up and causes ROI to be comparatively low.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'SEO isn’t a direct response model. When you invest in SEO, it may take three
    to six months to see results, and the scale of the results is difficult to forecast.
    In addition, no money is paid to third parties: with SEO, your content that ranks
    high in Google search results has earned that placement, and you did not have
    to pay Google for your presence there.'

- en: 'There is a cost to SEO, of course, which is the amount of money you invest
    in the team you have that works on SEO on your behalf as well as others who collaborate
    with the SEO team (such as development and writing teams). But because there is
    less certainty of the rankings and traffic you might get as a result of your investment
    in SEO, many senior managers are reluctant to make the investment, or they limit
    the size of that investment. This frequently leads to their not taking advantage
    of many opportunities to grow their organic search traffic. (Note: if you use
    generative AI to assist in your SEO efforts, the cost of those efforts will be
    less and will lower the risk associated with the investment. Hence the reason
    for this book!) This opens the door for more aggressive organizations to make
    those investments and take advantage of those opportunities. As a result, they

- en: Perhaps this will cause you to consider going more granular and create another
    20 pages that address some long-tail search terms. On average, these pages might
    address 0.9% of user needs, or 18% in total across the 20-page long-tail set.
    Add that to the 35% satisfied by the nine other pages, and you address the needs
    of 53% of users (finally over half).

    user needs with 50 more pages that average satisfying another 0.3% of users per
    page. Doing these nets us 15% more happy visitors and brings our total up to 68%—more
    than two-thirds of visitors.

    vary greatly from the specific numbers used in this example, but the same general
    concept will apply. You want to come up with a content plan that addresses a large
    percentage of user needs related to the topical areas covered on your site.

- en: You can also create too many long-tail pages. For example, if you’re trying
    to create pages that address every possible search query, even if they are minor
    variants of other search queries, you may run into problems. For example, queries
    like “resume writing services” and “writing services resume” don’t warrant a page
    being created for each of them—they both address the same user need.
