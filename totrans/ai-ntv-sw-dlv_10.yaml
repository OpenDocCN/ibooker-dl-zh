    that characterize modern software delivery. This long journey has illustrated
    the daunting complexity that modern software teams must contend with. In addition,
    modern software development has tended to “shift left” many concerns—security,
    observability, and infrastructure management work—that were previously handled
    by operations teams. If even the most experienced and well-resourced development
    teams are strained by this complexity and added responsibility, how are we to
    manage?

    this very question.It is the discipline of designing, building, and maintaining
    internal developer platforms that provide integrated tooling and infrastructure
    for software delivery. While previous chapters explored the individual components
    of modern software delivery, we’ll see in this chapter how platform engineering
    pulls these capabilities together into a cohesive platform that serves development
    teams.

    platform engineering teams. We’ll look at how these teams fit into organizations
    and what role they play in enabling rapid, secure delivery. Then we’ll dig into
    the practical aspects of building and operating high-performing platform teams—everything
    from team structure to day-to-day operations. We’ll explore concrete ways to measure
    developer platform effectiveness, ensuring our investments deliver real value.
    We’ll discuss the balance between standardization and team autonomy—how to provide
    guardrails without stifling innovation. Finally, we’ll look at strategies for
    sustainable platform evolution, ensuring our platform grows alongside our organization’s
    needs.

    development teams to navigate a complex landscape of tools and practices on their
    own. Platform engineering treats internal developer platforms as a strategic product,
    with development teams as valued customers. This shift comes at a critical time,
    as the rapid evolution of software practices has created a cognitive load crisis
    for developers, who must juggle an expanding set of responsibilities. Platform
    engineering addresses this crisis, and we’ll dig into the business case for it
    and how it reinforces a collaborative DevOps culture.

    delivery process promises to accelerate delivery or to improve software quality.
    The cumulative effect, however, can create an unsustainable cognitive burden on
    our development teams. Consider that developers must juggle SCM, CI/CD pipeline
    configuration, IaC templates, security scanning tools, deployment strategies,
    monitoring systems, and a host of other specialized tools. Each comes with its
    own complexities, best practices, and failure modes.
  prefs: []

    across the development lifecycle. While these tools promise to accelerate delivery,
    they often require significant expertise to implement effectively. Platform engineering
    can encapsulate this complexity, making AI capabilities accessible through standardized
    interfaces and templates, without requiring every developer to become an AI expert.

    of engineering leaders found that 78% of developers spend at least 30% of their
    time on manual, repetitive tasks rather than writing code. Hours get consumed
    by operational responsibilities and tool management—activities that, while necessary,
    pull developers away from their most valuable work: creating innovative solutions
    to business problems. As concerning as the lost time itself is the fragmentation
    of focus that creates a cognitive burden that directly impacts delivery quality
    and speed. Legacy processes often compound the challenge, generating low-value
    work that prevents deep, creative thinking.'

    writing application logic, debugging pipelines, investigating security alerts,
    and troubleshooting production issues, each transition extracts a mental cost.
    This cost doesn’t just slow feature delivery—it fundamentally undermines the conditions
    that enable developer excellence. Deep, uninterrupted focus time drives software
    quality and innovation. When developers constantly jump between coding and operational
    tasks, both technical excellence and creative problem-solving suffer, leading
    to accumulated technical debt.

    retention, and the ability to attract top talent. The best engineering organizations
    understand that a great developer experience—where engineers can spend more time
    solving problems and less time wrestling with inefficiencies—not only leads to
    better software but also fosters a culture where top talent thrives and sticks
    around. A successful platform will address these sources of dissatisfaction, and
    developers will flock to it. If most developers must be forced to use a platform,
    there’s likely something wrong with the platform or its rollout.

    teams can follow with confidence. Paved roads often take the form of application
    or infrastructure templates. Consider a standard web application template. Starting
    from scratch, developers might require several days to manually string together
    foundational capabilities and set up deployment—tedious and redundant work. A
    platform-provided template comes preconfigured with essential frameworks already
    in place. This includes standardized approaches for metrics collection, fault
    tolerance patterns, security configurations with sensible defaults, and structured
    logging with request tracing—all integrated within a cohesive framework. Templates
    can extend beyond application code to include infrastructure definitions and deployment
    pipeline configurations, forming a comprehensive application foundation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    standardize approaches and encapsulate organizational best practices for cross-cutting
    concerns like authentication, logging, and error handling. The operational layer
    includes deployment pipelines that incorporate security scanning, load testing,
    and automated rollback procedures. The infrastructure layer leverages automation
    to provision resources with appropriate security groups, monitoring configurations,
    and disaster recovery procedures.

    abstract underlying complexity while maintaining security and compliance guardrails.
    For instance, a platform might provide an API for provisioning databases that

    automate this tedious setup and configuration work while embedding best practices,
    security, and compliance standards. This makes developers more productive—with
    templated code in place, they can immediately focus on building features. Moreover,
    when they go to work on another project, whether because they’ve changed teams
    or because they need to update a dependency, they will be more comfortable and
    productive due to the familiar environment. Meanwhile, this added consistency
    reduces risk as it is easier to manage risks across a handful of standard tools
    and templates than a constellation of unique snowflakes scattered across the organization.'

    by a platform team will vary significantly from organization to organization.
    There’s no one-size-fits-all approach. A platform team’s focus must be laser-sharp
    on addressing the unique needs and use cases of its internal development teams.
    What works for a large financial institution with stringent compliance requirements
    will likely look very different from the platform built for a fast-moving startup.
    The key is for the platform team to deeply understand its “customers”—the development
    teams—and tailor its offerings to their specific pain points and workflows. Later
    in this chapter, we dig into the product mindset that platform engineering requires
    to ensure that the team is a true, developer experience–focused service provider

    software development and operations, we can realize developer and operations productivity
    gains that make our teams more efficient and reduce the costs associated with
    risk. Consider the cost of developer time. If most developers spend roughly 30%
    of their time on repetitive, non-value-added tasks, for an organization with just
    250 developers, this translates to substantial recoverable costs. Across companies
    we surveyed, developers earned an average of $107,599 annually, amounting to over
    $32,000 per developer in lost productivity annually. For organizations with 250
    developers, this represents an $8 million hidden cost in lost development time.'

    repetitive tasks, recovering lost time. Platform standardization and centralized
    platform development eliminate efforts duplicated across teams. This enables operations
    teams to support a larger application portfolio with existing headcount while
    maintaining consistent security and compliance standards.

    productivity. It addresses the business risks that keep teams up at night. Developer
    platform *paved roads* reduce the risk and potential cost of security breaches
    by eliminating security gaps that arise from inconsistent implementations across
    teams. With standardized deployment processes and monitoring practices, platform
    teams can reduce both the frequency and the impact of service outages. By embedding
    proven patterns for high availability and disaster recovery into platform components,
    organizations maintain business continuity even during incidents. Meanwhile, built-in
    compliance controls and automated audit trails help organizations avoid costly
    regulatory violations.

    knowledge allows the team to create integrated solutions that address the full
    spectrum of developer needs. The team should include engineers with experience
    in key bottleneck areas like security and compliance, in addition to engineers
    versed in development, enterprise architecture, and existing tools. As AI becomes
    a fundamental part of software delivery, platform teams benefit from including
    at least one member with expertise in AI/ML operations. This role bridges the
    gap between data science and software delivery, helping the team effectively integrate
    and manage AI-powered tools within the platform. They ensure AI components remain

    how the team will engage with the larger organization. A successful platform team
    requires an engagement model that provides a deep understanding of developer needs
    and promotes effective collaboration across the organization. Platform teams must
    also engage with their customers—the development teams—in a thoughtful and structured
    manner.

    in some organizations. With this model, platform engineers temporarily embed themselves
    within individual development teams. The hands-on approach gives the teams insights
    into the daily challenges faced by developers; it fosters empathy and creates
    a deeper understanding of their needs. By working side-by-side with developers,
    platform engineers can identify pain points, bottlenecks, and opportunities for
    improvement. This ensures that the platform evolves in tandem with the unique
    needs of specific teams while still maintaining a central governance structure.
    This model can work particularly well when you are just getting started with platform
    engineering, as it helps form a deep understanding of team challenges and constraints.

    team operates as a distinct, cross-functional group serving all development teams.
    They provide feedback on platform features, advocate for adoption, and assist
    with the integration of platform capabilities into development workflows. Collaboration
    across the organization ensures that the platform remains aligned with the evolving
    needs of the development community. This model works well for larger organizations
    with diverse projects, as it provides clear ownership and centralized best practices
    while reducing the duplication of effort.

    strategic priorities. The stage of your platform maturity can also be a factor.
    As the platform matures and the user base grows, the engagement model needs to
    scale. While high-touch support might be feasible for early adopters, a more scalable
    approach is necessary for widespread adoption. Self-service onboarding, enabled
    by comprehensive documentation and intuitive tools, allows teams to integrate

    predefined boundaries, knowing that their actions won’t compromise the stability
    or security of the platform. Crucially, policies can also be used to signal upcoming
    changes, such as deprecating older systems or templates. By issuing warnings well

    feedback. Use these to guide road map development and identify developer needs
    and pain points. Are certain features underutilized? Are there common support
    requests that indicate areas for improvement? For instance, if you notice increasing
    support tickets around a particular service coupled with declining usage patterns,
    it might indicate a reliability issue that requires immediate attention. Regular
    platform health checks should examine both technical metrics (error rates, response
    times) and adoption metrics (feature usage, team onboarding success).
