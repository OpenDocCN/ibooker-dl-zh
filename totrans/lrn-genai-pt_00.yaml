- en: What is generative AI? How is it different from its nongenerative counterparts,
    discriminative models? Why do we choose PyTorch as the AI framework in this book?

- en: In this part, we answer these questions. In addition, all generative AI models
    in this book are deep neural networks. Therefore, you’ll learn how to use PyTorch
    to create deep neural networks to perform binary and multicategory classifications
    so that you become well versed in deep learning and classification tasks. The
    intention is to get you ready for the upcoming chapters, where you use deep neural
    networks in PyTorch to create various generative models. You’ll also learn to
    use PyTorch to build and train generative adversarial networks to generate shapes
    and sequences of numbers.
