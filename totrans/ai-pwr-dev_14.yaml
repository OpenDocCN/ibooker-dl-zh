- en: This appendix will take you through installing the Copilot extension into Visual
    Studio Code and PyCharm. Visual Studio Code, commonly abbreviated VS Code, is
    a cross-platform, programming-language-agnostic integrated development environment
    (IDE) created by Microsoft. Microsoft makes VS Code available at no cost. It has
    excellent Copilot support, so it is an ideal choice as you work through this book.
    PyCharm is a Python-specific IDE from JetBrains. JetBrains offers a community
    version, which is available for free. In addition, it has an extension to enable
    Copilot support. Either choice is fine, as they are both excellent tools.
