- en: Part 1 lays the essential groundwork for understanding and building causal models.
    Here, I’ll introduce key concepts from statistics, probabilistic modeling, generative
    machine learning, and Bayesian methods that will serve as our building blocks
    for this book’s approach to causal modeling. This part is all about arming you
    with the core concepts you need to start solving causal problems with machine
    learning tools.
