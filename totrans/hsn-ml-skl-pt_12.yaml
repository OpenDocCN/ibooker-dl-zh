- en: PyTorch is a powerful open source deep learning library developed by Facebook’s
    AI Research lab (FAIR, now called Meta AI). It is the Python successor of the
    Torch library, originally written in the Lua programming language. With PyTorch,
    you can build all sorts of neural network models and train them at scale using
    GPUs (or other hardware accelerators, as we will see). In many ways it is similar
    to NumPy, except it also supports hardware acceleration and autodiff (see [Chapter 9](ch09.html#ann_chapter)),
    and includes optimizers and ready-to-use neural net components.

  zh: PyTorch 是由 Facebook 的 AI 研究实验室（FAIR，现称为 Meta AI）开发的一个强大的开源深度学习库。它是用 Lua 编程语言编写的
    Torch 库的 Python 后继者。使用 PyTorch，您可以构建各种神经网络模型，并使用 GPU（或我们将会看到的其他硬件加速器）进行大规模训练。在许多方面，它与
    NumPy 类似，但它还支持硬件加速和自动微分（见[第 9 章](ch09.html#ann_chapter)），并包括优化器和现成的神经网络组件。
- en: 'When PyTorch was released in 2016, Google’s TensorFlow library was by far the
    most popular: it was fast, it scaled well, and it could be deployed across many
    platforms. But its programming model was complex and static, making it difficult
    to use and debug. In contrast, PyTorch was designed from the ground up to provide
    a more flexible, Pythonic approach to building neural networks. In particular,
    as you will see, it uses dynamic computation graphs (also known as define-by-run),
    making it intuitive and easy to debug. PyTorch is also beautifully coded and documented,
    and focuses on its core task: making it easy to build and train high-performance
    neural networks. Last but not least, it leans strongly into the open source culture
    and benefits from an enthusiastic and dedicated community, and a rich ecosystem.
    In September 2022, PyTorch’s governance was even transferred to the PyTorch Foundation,
    a subsidiary of the Linux Foundation. All these qualities resonated well with
    researchers: PyTorch quickly became the most used framework in academia, and once
    a majority of deep learning papers were based on PyTorch, a large part of the
    industry was gradually converted as well.⁠^([1](ch10.html#id2228))'

    是从头开始设计的，旨在提供一种更灵活、更 Pythonic 的方法来构建神经网络。特别是，正如您将看到的，它使用动态计算图（也称为运行时定义），这使得它直观且易于调试。PyTorch
    的代码和文档也非常精美，专注于其核心任务：使构建和训练高性能神经网络变得容易。最后但同样重要的是，它强烈倾向于开源文化，并受益于一个热情且专注的社区，以及丰富的生态系统。2022
    年 9 月，PyTorch 的治理权甚至转移到了 Linux 基金会的子公司 PyTorch 基金会。所有这些品质都与研究人员产生了共鸣：PyTorch 迅速成为学术界最常用的框架，一旦大多数深度学习论文都基于
    PyTorch，行业的大部分也逐渐转向了它。⁠^([1](ch10.html#id2228))

    core building blocks of PyTorch, namely tensors and autograd, next we will test
    the waters by building and training a simple linear regression model, and then
    we will upgrade this model to a multilayer neural network, first for regression,
    then for classification. Along the way, we will see how to build custom neural
    networks with multiple inputs or outputs. Finally, we will discuss how to automatically
    fine-tune hyperparameters using the Optuna library, and how to optimize and export

    releases, platforms, or devices, so if you do not run the code in this chapter
    with PyTorch 2.8.0 on a Colab runtime with an Nvidia T4 GPU, you may get different
    results. Moreover, since a GPU splits each operation into multiple chunks and
    runs them in parallel, the order in which these chunks finish may vary across
    runs, and this may slightly affect the result due to floating-point precision
    errors. These minor differences may compound during training, and lead to very
    different models. To avoid this, you can tell PyTorch to use only deterministic
    algorithms by calling `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)` and setting `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark
    = False`. However, deterministic algorithms are often slower than stochastic ones,

    You can also tweak the number of batches that each worker pre-fetches by setting
    the data loader’s `prefetch_factor` argument. Note that the overhead of spawning

    in [Chapter 9](ch09.html#ann_chapter), but what if you want to go further and
    automatically search for good hyperparameter values? One option is to convert
    your PyTorch model to a Scikit-Learn estimator, either by writing your own custom
    estimator class or by using a wrapper library such as Skorch ([*https://skorch.readthedocs.io*](https://skorch.readthedocs.io)),
    and then use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to fine-tune the hyperparameters,
    as you did in [Chapter 2](ch02.html#project_chapter). However, you will usually
    get better results by using a dedicated fine-tuning library such as Optuna ([*https://optuna.org*](https://optuna.org)),
    Ray Tune ([*https://docs.ray.io*](https://docs.ray.io)), or Hyperopt ([*https://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt*](https://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt)).

    Let’s tune the learning rate and the number of neurons in the hidden layers (for

    we need to define a function that Optuna will call many times to perform hyperparameter
    tuning: this function must take a `Trial` object and use it to ask Optuna for
    hyperparameter values, and then use these hyperparameter values to build and train
    a model. Finally, the function must evaluate the model (typically on the validation

    complex and efficient neural networks. I hope you enjoyed this introduction to
    PyTorch! We covered a lot, but the adventure is only beginning: in the next chapter
    we will discuss techniques to train very deep nets. After that, we will dive into
    other popular neural network architectures: convolutional neural networks for
    image processing, recurrent neural networks for sequential data, transformers
    for text (and much more), autoencoders for representation learning, and generative
    adversarial networks and diffusion models to generate data.⁠^([14](ch10.html#id2429))
    Then we will visit reinforcement learning to train autonomous agents, and finally,
    we will learn more about deploying and optimizing your PyTorch models. Let’s go!'

    so on. You can optionally use Optuna for this.

    were fixed in version 2, and Google also launched JAX, which is well designed
    and extremely fast, so PyTorch still has some healthy competition. The good news
    is that the APIs of all these libraries have converged quite a bit, so switching
    from one to the other is much easier than it used to be.

    is equal to exp(*x*), it makes a lot of sense to store the output of this operation
    in the computation graph during the forward pass, then use this output during
    the backward pass to get the gradients: no need to store additional data, and
    no need to recompute exp(*x*).'

- en: ^([6](ch10.html#id2275-marker)) For example, the derivative of abs(*x*) is –1
    when *x* < 0 and +1 when *x* > 0\. If this operation saved its output in the computation
    graph, the backward pass would be unable to know whether *x* was positive or negative
    (since abs(*x*) is always positive), so it wouldn’t be able to compute the gradients.
    This is why this operation must save its input instead.

- en: ^([7](ch10.html#id2276-marker)) For example, the derivative of floor(*x*) is
    always zero (at least for noninteger inputs), so the `floor()` operation just
    saves the shape of the inputs during the forward pass, then during the backward
    pass it produces gradients of the same shape but full of zeros. For integer inputs,
    autograd also returns zeros instead of NaN.

    (shape [1, *m*]) are often preferred over 1D vectors (shape [*m*]) in machine
    learning, as they avoid ambiguity in some operations, such as matrix multiplication
    or broadcasting, and they make the code more consistent whether there’s just one
    feature or more.
