   <p>Conversational AI builders would love it if their systems contained all user conversations. But for most use cases, some percentage of users will end their interaction with a human and not your bot. Conversational AI is designed to handle the easily automated conversations and direct the higher-value or more challenging ones to human agents. Users who want to self-service may be frustrated by “failing” with the conversational AI, so it’s important to give that human agent the best start possible at handling the call after a transfer.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p7">
   <p>The two simplest handoff methods are also the least satisfactory. We can transfer the conversation “blind” to the human agent and have them ask again for all the information they need. Or we can pass the agent the full conversational transcript and ask them to search it for the information they need (while the user is waiting!). It’s better to give the human agent a targeted summary of the conversation to date so they can quickly pick up where the conversational AI left off.</p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p11">
   <p>Most conversational AI solutions store full transcripts of conversations for auditing and data analysis purposes. This is a treasure trove of training data when you have time to analyze it. But when you are a call center agent being transferred a conversation from the AI, you don’t have time to read a lengthy transcript. You need to quickly grasp the essence of the user’s problem so you can start helping them. We’ve seen AI chat transcripts that go for multiple pages (hundreds of words). An agent needs a few targeted bullet points—any more will take too long to read, and any less will not convey enough useful information.</p>

   <p>From the previous chapter, we know that some users immediately opt out to an agent, but many users go through a series of steps before getting frustrated. The following listing shows an example conversation where the user apparently accomplishes their goal but still requests an agent.</p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p16">
   <p>We’re not sure why the user opted out (maybe the check didn’t arrive?). But that is beside the point. In most conversational AI solutions, users can opt out anywhere in the conversation. The conversation in listing 12.1 had seven turns and probably took about two minutes. It’s just long enough that it takes some effort to read and comprehend. Would you want to read that full conversation if you were the human agent? What if the conversation was longer?</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p17">
   <p>A smooth handoff should happen quickly. The agent should quickly comprehend what has happened so they can be effective. The user should not have to wait for agent to get up to speed. An effective summary facilitates all those needs.</p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p18">
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">12.1.2</span> Elements of effective summaries</h3>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p19">
   <p>A conversation summary includes just enough information to understand the complete conversation. It should include structured metadata and a short text summary; the summary’s contents will vary based on your specific use case. Figure 12.2 shows an example.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p20">
   <h4 class=" readable-text-h4">Metadata summary elements</h4>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p21">
   <p>Structured summary elements often come from closed-form questions, such as “What’s your member ID?” (“Open-form” questions are like “How may I help?”) These summary elements can include data that was collected during the conversation or context that was supplied from outside of the conversation.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p22">
   <p>These are some example elements:</p>
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p23"> User ID of the logged-in user (chat) or the caller’s phone number (voice/SMS) </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p24"> Identifiers collected during the chat </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p25"> Identifiers found during the chat </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p26"> Number of chat sessions the user has ever had </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p27"> Sentiment analysis of user utterances </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p28">
   <img alt="figure" src="../Images/CH12_F02_Freed2.png" width="887" height="427"/>
   <h5 class=" figure-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Figure 12.2</span> An effective summary pulls out key details from the conversation. Here it includes a summary of the conversation and the last claim searched. The AI portion of the call may have taken two minutes, but the human agent can read the summary in seconds.</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p29">
   <p>In figure 12.2, the chat collected five pieces of information, but the human agent only needs to know three. Figure 12.3 breaks down the summary.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>
  </div> 
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p30">
   <img alt="figure" src="../Images/CH12_F03_Freed2.png" width="861" height="424"/>
   <h5 class=" figure-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Figure 12.3</span> Not every closed-form question needs to be stored in the summary. In this medical insurance claim review, the most important information is the provider ID, member ID, and claim ID.</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p31">
   <p>In this medical insurance claim search, it takes a lot of information to validate the caller. We need to verify who is calling, who they are calling about, and what they are calling about. It takes three data elements alone to confirm the member information: an ID, a date, and a confirmation of the name. The human agent receiving the transfer only needs to know that the member was verified, and the member ID suffices for that.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p32">
   <p>Similarly, there are many pieces of information about the claim—some given by the user (date of service) and some by the AI (status, paid date, paid amount). The summary only includes the claim ID, which will be sufficient for the agent to retrieve the full claim, including all the details that were not part of the conversation.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p33">
   <p>It’s useful to include summary elements in software used by human agents fielding conversations. In contact center software, this is called a <em>screen pop</em>—a feature that displays contextual information to an agent while they handle a conversation. Figure 12.4 shows an example screen pop for our medical insurance agent. They receive the structured information as a highlight, and through backend integration, they can get even more information. Clicking on the member ID should show information about the member or an image of their ID card. Clicking on the claim should show the claim itself (for instance, as a PDF).<span class="aframe-location"/></p>
  </div> 
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p34">
   <img alt="figure" src="../Images/CH12_F04_Freed2.png" width="744" height="234"/>
   <h5 class=" figure-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Figure 12.4</span> When a summary is integrated with contact center software, the human agent can have a wealth of information at their fingertips. When an insurance agent clicks on the member ID in their software, they could get additional details on that member.</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p35">
   <p>Structured metadata gives key data points from the conversation so far. It prevents the human agent from having to re-ask questions that the user has already answered for the bot. Users get <em>very</em> frustrated when they must answer the same questions again! The human agent benefits from having this information at their fingertips, but they still need to be aware of the overall context of the conversation. That’s where the free-text summary comes in.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p36">
   <h4 class=" readable-text-h4">Free-text summary elements</h4>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p37">
   <p>A conversation may have included hundreds of words before it was transferred to a human agent. (The example transcript we are using is about 100 words.) The average adult reads at 200 words per minute when reading for fun and slower for complex material. Our user doesn’t want to wait any longer than necessary, so our human agent needs to get up to speed quickly. A good summary can reduce that time by minutes.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p38">
   <p>Follow the “keep it simple” philosophy. A summary of one to two sentences conveys a lot of information quickly. The free-text summary in our example—“User searched for their claim and found it was paid three months after filing”—encapsulates the entire search process in the first five words as well as a likely reason for transfer in the last eight words.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p39">
   <p>The free-text summary is also not repetitive. It eliminates several redundant pieces of information:</p>
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p40"> <em>The user’s initial intent</em><em> </em>—This is not explicitly included, since it is inferred from a claim search being done. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p41"> <em>The intermediate questions</em><em> </em>—It does not say “The bot asked for the tax ID, member ID, date of birth, etc.” These are all implied from the user finding the claim. The system does not find claims until sufficient information is provided. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p42"> <em>The structured content</em><em> </em>—The summary doesn’t need to waste words repeating the structured content, which has already been provided in compact form. </li> 
  </ul>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p43">
   <p>The summary also does not identify who initiated the transfer (the user or the system). This could be added in a new structured field.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p44">
   <p>There are trade-offs in the summarization process. Too brief a summary will omit information that helps the agent. Too lengthy a summary will not help the agent learn quickly, compared to reading the original transcript. Choose a summarization methodology that works best for your use case. </p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p45">
   <p>Later in this chapter, we will show you how to use generative AI to generate summaries. First, though, we need the conversational AI to structure data in the right format to generate summaries.</p>

   <p>Some conversational AI platforms require you to create and store the conversation transcript yourself. Or you may choose to create your own version of the transcript in the exact format you prefer. Either way, this is implemented in your <em>orchestration layer</em>, as shown in figure 12.6. The orchestration layer is responsible for calling external systems via APIs. The specific terminology will vary based on your conversational AI platform, but this is often called a <em>webhook</em>.</p>

   <p>Listing 12.3 demonstrates a post-webhook, since it has access to the request and the response. Every time the bot responds to the user, the webhook updates the transcript. This transcript includes the minimum possible elements—just the user and bot messages—and a very simple one-message-per-line format, readable by humans. You can create your transcript in whatever format you wish, such as a single string, string array, JSON object, or custom object.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p70">
   <p>As shown earlier, a simple transcript is easiest to read. Conversational AI platforms generally have many data elements available per message that you can optionally use in your transcripts:</p>
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p71"> <em>Message timestamp</em><em> </em>—You can use a timestamp to show the absolute time a message was received or sent (“11:25:53 AM”) or the relative time since the beginning of the chat (“00:01:15” for a message 1 minute and 15 seconds after the beginning). </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p72"> <em>Buttons</em><em> </em>—You can indicate when the bot offered options via buttons and when the user clicked on a button. This is especially interesting in voice solutions, where users may enter dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF, or “touch tone”) input through their keypad. For example, you’ll know that the user pressed “0” rather than saying “zero.” </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p73"> <em>Original or post-processed input</em><em> </em>—Many conversational AI platforms normalize certain input types like dates and numbers. You can use the original utterance, like “February first two thousand twenty-four” or a post-processed version like “02/01/2024”. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p74"> <em>Rich-text and non-text elements</em><em> </em>—Your bot may respond with HTML markup or even images and links that may not be suitable for a transcript. </li> 
  </ul>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p75">
   <p>The pseudocode in listing 12.3 demonstrated how to update a context variable that tracked conversational context, but it did not demonstrate how to initialize that variable. The simplest option is to initialize an empty string like the following: <code>response.context.transcript = ''</code>. </p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p76">
   <p>Several other data elements related to a conversation are available, and you may wish to include them at the beginning of your transcript:</p>
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p77"> <em>Session timestamp</em><em> </em>—When the conversation started. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p78"> <em>Session duration</em><em> </em>—How long the conversation lasted. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p79"> <em>User identifier</em><em> </em>—This could include information about a logged-in user accessing the chat, such as name, email, or user ID. For a phone solution, this could be the caller’s phone number. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p80"> <em>Device and channel identifier</em><em> </em>—How the user accessed your conversational AI, such as device type (e.g., mobile or desktop) or which channel they used (e.g., chat widget, SMS, Facebook Messenger, etc.). </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p81"> <em>Transfer reason</em><em> </em>—Why the bot transferred the caller to an agent, such as “immediate opt-out,” “opt-out,” or “bot didn’t understand user.” </li> 
  </ul>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p82">
   <p>You may instead choose to leave these elements for the structured section of the summary (as key-value pairs), rather than including them in a prose summary, since they apply to the entire conversation.</p>

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p83">
   <p>All these data elements and more are typically available in your conversational AI platform. They are often included in the AI’s system logs, which are another data source for building transcripts. These optional data elements are provided by conversational AI platforms because they are generic and are applicable to any conversation as metadata. They are a great start to any conversational transcript.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p84">
   <p>We saw earlier in the chapter that a good summary includes more than an unstructured transcript. Structured metadata is quite useful in summarizing the important parts of a conversation. Some parts of this metadata are not generic—they are specific for your exact implementation. In our medical insurance example, member IDs and claim IDs were unique. </p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p85">
   <p>The conversational AI platform doesn’t give any special meaning to member IDs—they are recorded as just another user message. If you want to use specific contextual elements from your implementation in a summary, you’ll have to instrument the AI yourself to store them so that they can be included in a summary. Let’s see how.</p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p87">
   <p>Conversational AI platforms generally let you store arbitrary values in variables, often called <em>context variables</em> or <em>session variables</em>. You should make use of these for any data you collect during the conversation that has significant meaning, especially if it helps you find more information later. </p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p88">
   <p>The data you store will vary based on your specific application. Here are a few examples by domain:</p>
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p89"> <em>Medical insurance</em><em> </em>—Member ID, provider ID, claim ID </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p90"> <em>Retail</em><em> </em>—Order number, product ID, retail location </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p91"> <em>Banking</em><em> </em>—Account ID, account type </li> 
  </ul>
  <div class="readable-text" id="p92">
   <p>Any time the bot asks a question with a fixed-format response, like “what’s your claim ID,” that response is a good candidate for instrumentation.</p>

   <div class="readable-text" id="p94">
    <p>Many types of data need to be treated carefully. There are rules and regulations on how to handle data that could identify a person (PI) or other sensitive data points. Your conversational AI may already deal with them, but adding them to summaries or logs may need to be reviewed with your legal team. Be minimalist in what you collect, what you store, and how long you store it, and confirm your choices with your lawyers.</p>
   </div>

   <p>The way you store context will depend on your conversational AI platform. You may be able to do this in a user interface, or your platform may require you to write code. Figure 12.7 shows the low-code method used in our platform to store context variables.</p>

   <p>The model follows the instruction. The last message from the bot tells the user their claim was paid (“The claim was paid on May 23, 2024 for $201.83”), and the user then opts out. The LLM summary succinctly says, “they want to know why their claim is denied.” This summary is short but perhaps too speculative, seeing that the claim was paid and not actually denied. Maybe the user felt they should have been paid more, or maybe they needed an itemized list. The text summary also omits the near-verbatim playback of the transcript seen in listing 12.6, leaving that information for a separate structured summary. We’re closer to what our human agent needs. Let’s improve the prompt to reduce the LLM’s speculation. </p>

   <p>This generated summary is also quite reasonable when combined with the structured metadata. There is some speculation—“they want more information”—but again it seems like the user would need more information if they wanted an agent after finding the claim is supposedly paid. The summary is also structured after the example, with a token-for-token match in the first six words of the summary.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p123">
   <p>Note that in the one-shot summarization example (listing 12.8), we used a slightly different format. Instead of using delineation via <code>Transcript:</code>, we used specially formatted tokens like <code>&lt;|transcript|&gt;</code>. Without these special tokens, we were unable to generate good summaries. Likely the model had trouble separating the prompt sections and the conversation elements because both used colons. Future large language models (LLMs) may be more resilient to delineation characters appearing multiple places in the prompt. This kind of small change can have a huge effect on LLM performance.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p124">
   <p>Either emphasizing instructions or examples in your prompts can work. Consider the following tradeoffs:</p>
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p125"> <em>Control of the output</em><em> </em>—Most LLMs are trained on summarization by default. Many are responsive to instructions and generate good summaries. One-shot and few-shot prompts further constrain the output to use the language you desire, though you may have to provide several examples. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p126"> <em>Cost</em><em> </em>—Adding examples increases the inference cost due to there being more input tokens. </li>

   <p>The text summaries we have generated so far include an overview of the conversation but mostly do not include the structured metadata that will be helpful for the agent.

   <p>This worked well. We only get the keys we desired. It’s slightly frustrating that the one-shot example needed to be so close to the second transcript. This implies that to summarize other conversational flows, we may need to provide examples for each one. (What if the conversation includes authorization IDs, electronic payment IDs, or other IDs?) And there’s one other gotcha: the <code>TaxID</code> and <code>MemberID</code> were numeric values, but it produced a string value for <code>ClaimID</code>—even after seeing the example.</p>
