<h1><span class="label">Chapter 7. </span>Ideas, Planning, and Requirements</h1>
<p>In this chapter<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="software project with AI assistance" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_softwareprojectwithAIassistance.07.3.19"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-secondary="software project role of" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_ChatGPTsoftwareprojectroleof.07.3.19"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-assisted programming" data-secondary="software project role" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_AIassistedprogrammingsoftwareprojectrole.07.3.19"/>, we’ll dig into the important early stages of making software. This is where all the cool ideas come alive and where we plan them out so they’re ready to go. We’re going to use ChatGPT to brainstorm effectively and plan things down to the last detail. We’ll look at market research, keep an eye on trends, and check out the competition. We’ll also talk about whiteboarding, which is a fun, visual way to throw around ideas and make them better. Plus, we’ll dive into how to plan your project, looking at methods like Agile and Scrum, and how to tweak them to fit your software project.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Brainstorming" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="brainstorming">
<h1>Brainstorming</h1>
<p>Thousands<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="software project with AI assistance" data-secondary="brainstorming" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_softwareprojectwithAIassistancebrainstorming.07.6.13"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="brainstorming a project" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_brainstormingaproject.07.6.13"/> of software products pop up every day, so it’s no walk in the park to make something that really shines and stands out from the crowd. But with an LLM like ChatGPT, you can do some brainstorming.</p>
<p>First of all, you can have it provide different approaches. Here’s a prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What are techniques for brainstorming ideas for new products? Use the internet to research this question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT dished out 10 helpful approaches—here’s a peek at a few of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ChatGPT:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>5 Whys: You start with a problem and keep asking “why” it happened. It’s handy for looking back and figuring out what went wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Bad Idea: Think up a bunch of terrible ideas on purpose. Chatting about why they’re so bad can actually spark clever solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Starbursting: This is about questions, not answers. You use a star-shaped diagram and hit it with questions like: who, what, when, where, why and how.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Suppose you want to use the starbursting approach. You can learn more about this with the following prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How would you use starbursting as a way to come up with a new idea for a software product?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT gave a straightforward breakdown of the starbursting exercise as applied to this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ChatGPT:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Who: Think about who’s going to use your software.</p></li>
<li><p>What: Get into what problem your software is solving. How is it different from what’s already out there?</p></li>
<li><p>When: Figure out the best times to use your software, launch it, and do updates or fixes.</p></li>
<li><p>Where: What platforms or devices can people use the software on?</p></li>
<li><p>Why: Dive into why your software is a must-have. Why should people pick it over the others?</p></li>
<li><p>How: Think about how your software will work, how you’ll build and sell it, and how you’ll take care of your users when they need help.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Going through this process is a great way to get a clearer picture of your new software product idea.</p>
<p>Now, let’s say you want to come up with a list of ideas. It’s best to zero in on a specific category, know who you’re targeting, and understand what problem you want to tackle. Here are a few prompts to get you started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I want to develop a health-tracking app for seniors. The problem is the difficulty they face in monitoring chronic conditions and medication schedules. What features can be included to make the app senior-friendly and assist in managing their health more effectively?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> The target audience is college students struggling with managing their finances. What features should a budgeting app include to help them track expenses, save money, and understand financial planning easily?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I want to create a language learning app for busy professionals who struggle to find time for regular classes. Can you suggest features that cater to their tight schedules and offer quick, effective language-learning sessions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How good are the ideas that ChatGPT creates? Well, some Wharton School professors put it to the test in their <a href="https://oreil.ly/V7N31">MBA innovation class</a>. They had the students come up with a dozen product or service ideas. Then, they did the same thing with ChatGPT, tapping into the GPT-4 model. Among the ideas tossed out were things like a dorm room–friendly chef kit and a comfy cushion for those hard classroom seats.</p>
<p>To test these ideas, the professors used an online purchase-intent survey. The question was: “How likely would you be to purchase based on this concept if it were available to you?”</p>
<p>On average, around 40% of the student ideas were fairly solid, and ChatGPT scored slightly higher at 49%. But the professors didn’t stop there. They focused on the top 10% of ideas. These are the ones with real potential to be game-changers. And guess what? Out of the 40 top-notch ideas, only 5 were from the students<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_softwareprojectwithAIassistancebrainstorming.07.6.13" data-type="indexterm" id="id728"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_brainstormingaproject.07.6.13" data-type="indexterm" id="id729"/>.</p>

<h1>Market Research</h1>
<p>Before diving into a software project<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="software project with AI assistance" data-secondary="market research" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_softwareprojectwithAIassistancemarketresearch.07.49.41"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="market research, software project" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_marketresearchsoftwareproject.07.49.41"/>, it’s smart to ask a few key questions: Is there actually a need for this tool? Are customers willing to shell out cash for it? And just how big is the market for it?</p>
<p>This is all about doing your market research. Sure, it’s not a crystal ball, but it definitely helps lower the risk of pouring your time and energy into something that might not take off.</p>
<p>The truth is, a lot of new products don’t make it. Clayton Christensen<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Christensen, Clayton" data-type="indexterm" id="id730"/>, a Harvard professor and best-selling author, did a lot of research on this and found out that about <a href="https://oreil.ly/6BJ2H">80% of new products flop</a>.</p>
<p>And, when it comes to software projects, it seems that number may be even higher. <a data-type="xref" href="#failed_software_applications">Table 7-1</a> shows some of the most notable examples.</p>

<p>One of the most epic fails is the video game for Steven Spielberg’s 1982 movie <em>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</em>. Atari shelled out a whopping <a href="https://oreil.ly/pu8Gu">$21 million for the rights from <span class="keep-together">Universal</span> Pictures</a> and dropped another $5 million on <span class="keep-together">promoting it.</span></p>
<p>The game really flopped. It was super confusing and not much fun either. So, what happened? Atari only managed to sell about 1.5 million units. The remaining 2.5 million ended up in a landfill in New Mexico.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into how you can use ChatGPT for market research. First of all, we need to figure out the target audience. Think about who’s going to get the most out of this software. Let’s start brainstorming about who these users might be. Consider this prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What are potential target demographics for a project management software program?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can then have ChatGPT take on a task that’s important for getting to know your marketing: creating detailed user personas<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="user personas, for market research" data-type="indexterm" id="id731"/>. Think of these personas as characters that give you snapshots of the different kinds of people who might use your product. Details often include how old they are, their interests, their jobs, and their lifestyles. By mapping out these personas, you start to understand who your customers are and what they’re looking for.</p>
<p>I asked ChatGPT for some user personas for management software, and you can see some of its responses in <a data-type="xref" href="#chatgpt_created_user_personas_for_manage">Figure 7-1</a>.</p>

<p>ChatGPT can also be instrumental in drafting surveys and questionnaires to gather specific data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Could you create a survey focused on understanding what buyers look for in project management software? The survey should include questions that help identify key features, usability preferences, specific industry needs, and any particular challenges buyers want to address with this type of software. Additionally, please include questions that gauge the importance of factors such as cost, support, scalability, and integration capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of the other factors we need to consider when evaluating the market for software.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Market Trends" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="market_trends">
<h2>Market Trends</h2>
<p>When you’re rolling out new software<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="market trends" data-type="indexterm" id="id732"/>, digging into market research can make a big difference. It’s like getting insider information on what users are really after, and it also gives you the scoop on what your rivals are up to. Think of it as your secret playbook. You get to spot trends before they blow up and opportunities that others might miss. Plus, it’s a great safety net. It cuts down on the guesswork and helps you make smart choices that are more likely to hit the mark. And let’s not forget about marketing. Knowing your audience inside out means you can create ads and promos that resonate with them, instead of just throwing stuff out there and hoping it sticks.</p>
<p>ChatGPT can be a good sidekick for your market research. Of course, the model is trained only up to a certain date, but there’s a workaround: you can tell it to “research the internet” in your prompts.</p>
<p class="pagebreak-before">Here are some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Research the internet to find current trends in &lt;<em>specific software category, e.g., mobile gaming, educational technology</em>&gt; as of &lt;<em>year</em>&gt;.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Research the internet to provide an overview of emerging technologies in the software industry that are gaining popularity in &lt;<em>year</em>&gt;.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Research the internet to find the consumer behavior trends that are currently influencing the software market, particularly in &lt;<em>target demographic or application type</em>&gt;.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Research the internet to find the latest trends in user interface and user experience (UI/UX) design for software applications in &lt;<em>year</em>&gt;.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Research the internet to come up with a list of the top software applications in &lt;<em>a specific field or category</em>&gt; and explain what makes them successful in the current market.</p>
</blockquote>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Total Addressable Market" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="total_addressable_market">
<h2>Total Addressable Market</h2>
<p>The <em>total addressable market</em>, or TAM<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="TAM (total addressable market)" data-type="indexterm" id="id733"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="total addressable market (TAM)" data-type="indexterm" id="id734"/> for short, is an estimate of the maximum amount of money you could make if everyone who could use your product actually did. This helps you figure out where to focus your energy, how to position your product in the market, and what your growth game plan should be. It’s a reality check that helps you set achievable goals for how much of the market you can grab and the cash you can bring in.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists (VCs)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="venture capitalists (VCs), and TAM measure" data-type="indexterm" id="id735"/> weight TAM heavily when they’re figuring out where to put their money, since it shows how much growth potential there is. They’re always on the hunt for places where their investment could take off, and a hefty TAM means there’s a huge market just waiting to be tapped.</p>
<p>Usually, VCs look for a TAM that’s over a billion dollars—and ideally much more than that. After all, even if a company only grabs a small piece of such a huge market, the profits can be impressive.</p>
<p>In response to a prompt like “What are the different ways to estimate the size of the TAM?” ChatGPT will respond similar to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ChatGPT:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Top-down approach: You gather industry data and market research to get a sense of the whole market size. Then, you zoom in a bit, such as by focusing on the slice of the market you’re aiming for.</p></li>
<li><p>Bottom-up approach: You figure out how many people or businesses might buy your product, guess how many of them will actually go through with it (your conversion rate), and then think about how much each customer will bring in. This approach takes more work, but it can give you a clearer, more tailored picture.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="pagebreak-before">Let’s take an example. Suppose you have a startup in the medical technology category:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> SilverConnect Health is a health tech startup focusing on telemedicine services. The target market is in the United States, with a focus on elderly populations in urban areas. What is the current size of the telemedicine services market for SilverConnect Health? What are the projected growth rates for this market segment over the next 5–10 years?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT searches the internet and comes up with some useful facts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ChatGPT:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Market size in 2022: The U.S. telemedicine market was valued at more than USD 35 billion in 2022. Another estimate puts the telemedicine market size at USD 91.2 billion in the same year.</p></li>
<li><p>Projected growth rates: One estimate suggests a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.5% from 2023 to 2032. Another source projects a CAGR of 22.9% from 2023 to 2030<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_softwareprojectwithAIassistancemarketresearch.07.49.41" data-type="indexterm" id="id736"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_marketresearchsoftwareproject.07.49.41" data-type="indexterm" id="id737"/>.</p></li>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Competition" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="competition">
<h1>Competition</h1>
<p>There are several key benefits of competitive analysis<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="software project with AI assistance" data-secondary="competitive analysis" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_softwareprojectwithAIassistancecompetitiveanalysis.07.164.58"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="competitive analysis, project with AI" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_competitiveanalysisprojectwithAI.07.164.58"/>. First of all, it gives you a sneak peek into the market. You get to see what’s already out there, what’s working, and what’s not. This helps you spot any gaps that your software can fill, making sure you bring something fresh to the table.</p>
<p>Then, there’s learning from your competitors—both from their wins and their oops moments. This can really up your game.</p>
<p>Also, when you know what makes your software different, you can get specific with your marketing, hitting the right people more effectively.</p>
<p>As for ChatGPT, it can be helpful with competitive analysis. Here are some prompts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> List the main competitors for &lt;<em>your software type</em>&gt; in the &lt;<em>specific industry or market</em>&gt;.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Compare the features of &lt;<em>your software</em>&gt; with its top three competitors.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What are the pricing models used by competitors of &lt;<em>your software</em>&gt; in the market?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How do the leading competitors position themselves in the market for &lt;<em>type of software</em>&gt;?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Identify the strengths and weaknesses of &lt;<em>competitor’s name</em>&gt; software.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Summarize the customer reviews for &lt;<em>competitor’s software name</em>&gt; focusing on user satisfaction and pain points.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="pagebreak-before">You can also have ChatGPT put the analysis in a table, which can make it clearer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Can you provide a summary in bullet points of the key players in the customer relationship management (CRM) software market as of 2023? Put the results in a table.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#chatgpt_provides_a_competitive_analysis">Figure 7-2</a> shows the response.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 7-2. </span>ChatGPT provides a competitive analysis for the CRM market and formats it in a table</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>ChatGPT can even do a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis. This helps you play up your strong points, fix or work around weak spots, grab chances that come by, and dodge any curveballs. Businesses of all types use it, and it’s even useful for personal career moves<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_softwareprojectwithAIassistancecompetitiveanalysis.07.164.58" data-type="indexterm" id="id738"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_competitiveanalysisprojectwithAI.07.164.58" data-type="indexterm" id="id739"/>.</p>
</div></section>
<section class="pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="Requirements" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="requirements">
<h1 class="less_space">Requirements</h1>
<p>Requirements documents<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="software project with AI assistance" data-secondary="requirements documents" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_softwareprojectwithAIassistancerequirementsdocuments.07.189.26"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="requirements documents, project" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_requirementsdocumentsproject.07.189.26"/> are critical for software development. Here are just a handful of their benefits:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Give you direction</dt><dd><p>These documents lay out exactly what the software should do. Everyone, from developers to clients, gets what the plan is, which keeps things on track.</p></dd>
<dt>Keep everyone on the same page</dt><dd><p>They make sure everyone involved, like your team and your clients, understands what’s expected. This way, there’s less chance of mix-ups or wrong turns.</p></dd>
<dt>Help with planning</dt><dd><p>Need to figure out how long things will take or how much they’ll cost? These documents are your go-to for planning out the work, time, and money needed.</p></dd>
<dt>Improve communication</dt><dd><p>They’re great for clear communication, especially in big teams or when people are geographically spread out.</p></dd>
<dt>Reduce risks</dt><dd><p>Spotting potential problems early on? That’s what these documents help you do, so you can dodge delays and keep costs under control.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>Of course, coming up with software requirements isn’t easy, and a big reason why is that software development can get complicated. Then there are the challenges of coordinating the work and thinking of many team members, who may be in other countries and time zones. Each group has its own ideas and needs, and sometimes these don’t exactly match up or aren’t clear.</p>
<p>Another headache is that what people want from the software can keep changing. This is especially true when you’re working in a fast-paced industry. So, you’re often trying to hit a moving target with your requirements, which makes it tough to settle on something solid. In the meantime, you’ve got to make sure the requirements are doable and that you can verify that they’re being met.</p>
<p>When requirements are off base, the results can be disastrous. Here’s a look at a few examples:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Denver International Airport’s automated baggage system (1995)</dt><dd><p>The requirements were mind-numbingly complex, and the goals were overambitious. This led to a 16-month delay and skyrocketing costs. In the end, the airport decided to ditch the whole system.</p></dd>
<dt>FBI’s virtual case file system (2000–2005)</dt><dd><p>The FBI had only a vague idea of what it wanted. So yes, the system wound up not being of much use. In the end, the agency poured over $170 million into the project only to throw in the towel. The next project, called Sentinel, had much more specific requirements and, of course, was more successful.</p></dd>
<dt>HealthCare.gov launch (2013)</dt><dd><p>The federal government didn’t nail down what it needed and didn’t test it enough, so when it launched, it just couldn’t handle the traffic and wasn’t working right. The launch was a flop, and a lot of people had to put in a lot more work and money to fix it and get it running smoothly.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>In the world of software development, there’s an array of different requirements, each serving a unique purpose. You’ve got functional requirements that lay out what the software should do, like the tasks it should perform or the features it needs. Then there are non-functional requirements, which are about how the software should operate, such as with performance speed, security, and usability.</p>
<p>To explore how generative AI can help, we’ll focus on two types of important documents: the <em>product requirements document</em> (PRD) and the <em>software requirements specification</em> (SRS).</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Product Requirements Document" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="product_requirements_document">
<h2>Product Requirements Document</h2>
<p>A PRD<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="PRD (product requirements document)" data-type="indexterm" id="id740"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="product requirements document (PRD)" data-type="indexterm" id="id741"/> sets forth what your software will be and do. Think of it as a story, outlining what the application should look like, how it should behave, who’s going to use it, and what problems it’s going to solve. It is often detailed, covering everything from the must-have features to the user experience.</p>
<p>The audience for the PRD is diverse. It is for developers, designers, project managers, and the quality assurance team. It’s also crucial for executives or other stakeholders who need to understand the product’s vision and goals. Moreover, it can be useful for marketing teams to get an understanding of how to position the product. Essentially, it’s for anyone involved in bringing the product to market and making sure it hits the mark with its intended users.</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen a PRD, ChatGPT can help out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What are the main parts of a PRD? Create a Word document as a template.</p>

The SRS is like the nitty-gritty technical manual for a software project. Unlike the PRD, which takes on the perspective of end users or customers and focuses on what they need and why, the SRS goes deep into the specifics of what the software needs to do and how it should do it, focusing on the technical aspects.</p>
<p>If you have a simple app, the SRS could be just a few pages. But with more complex projects—say for an enterprise software implementation—it can easily run hundreds of pages.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some prompts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What are the essential elements and best practices to consider when drafting an effective SRS?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Outline the process for developing an SRS, emphasizing the steps involved in gathering and analyzing requirements, stakeholder collaboration, and documentation methodologies.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Create a detailed SRS for a software project, including sections like Project Overview, Stakeholder Analysis, Functional and Non-functional Requirements, Assumptions, and Constraints. &lt;<em>Add the details you want for each.</em>&gt;</p>

<p>Voice recognition software<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="voice recognition software" data-type="indexterm" id="id744"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="interviews, requirements document" data-type="indexterm" id="id745"/> has been around for several decades, but for the most part, it was more of a novelty than a practical tool. Usually, it was impractical for everyday use or professional settings, as it couldn’t reliably understand natural, conversational speech.</p>
<p>However, during the past few years, voice recognition has taken a leap forward, driven by the advances in AI. Modern systems are powered by sophisticated AI algorithms that are not only better at understanding a wide range of accents and dialects but also can grasp the context and nuances of spoken language. These systems learn and adapt over time, constantly improving their accuracy.</p>
<p>One way this can be helpful is during the interviews you often conduct to put together requirements documents.</p>
<p>For example, with voice recognition software, you can improve the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Accuracy and playback</dt><dd><p>While transcription accuracy is usually pretty good, you can use playback for corrections.</p></dd>
<dt>Speaker identification</dt><dd><p>Voice recognition can differentiate speakers in a meeting. This can help bring clarity to the requirements.</p></dd>
<dt>Key topics identification</dt><dd><p>Voice recognition software can highlight frequent keywords in the transcript, making it easier to identify and focus on main topics or requirements.</p></dd>
<dt>Summaries of key points</dt><dd><p>Voice recognition software can produce summaries of key points and suggest action items, aiding developers in pinpointing critical requirements and converting them into specific project tasks.</p></dd>

<h2>Whiteboarding</h2>
<p>Whiteboarding<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="whiteboarding, requirements document" data-type="indexterm" id="id746"/> is a common practice when putting together requirements for software projects. It can help with the brainstorming process and allow everyone to chip in. It allows for collecting lots of different ideas and viewpoints, which is key for nailing down what the software should do. It’s also hands-on—you can sketch out flowcharts or diagrams during the discussion, making complex stuff easier to get.</p>
<p>Well, ChatGPT can help with this. How? It can decipher images that you upload to the system.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you sketch out a login system, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#a_sketch_of_a_login_system_can_be_input">Figure 7-4</a>.</p>
<figure><div class="figure" id="a_sketch_of_a_login_system_can_be_input">
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0704.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 7-4. </span>A sketch of a login system can be input to ChatGPT</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>As you can see, my handwriting is kind of messy. I also use abbreviations, such as “pw” for “password.”</p>
<p>Let’s see if ChatGPT can figure it out. I used this prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Analyze the diagram.</p>
<p><em>ChatGPT:</em> The diagram you’ve uploaded appears to be a flowchart related to user account management, specifically for a login process on a website or application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It then set forth the whole process (<a data-type="xref" href="#chatgpt_analyzed_an_image_of_a_diagram_f">Figure 7-5</a>).</p>

<h2>Tone</h2>
<p>There’s an art to writing<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="writing style, requirements document" data-type="indexterm" id="id747"/> effective PRDs and SRSs. It’s important to strike the right tone. These documents should be clear, concise, and professional.</p>
<p>Let’s break down why the writing style matters:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Making it crystal clear</dt><dd><p>These documents are like the holy grail for your project. You want everything to be spot-on so that everyone gets what’s going on. This way, you dodge those pesky miscommunications and development blunders.</p></dd>
<dt>Sticking to the facts</dt><dd><p>PRDs and SRSs aren’t the place for personal or stylistic flair. You need to be like a news reporter here—just the facts, please. Keeping it straightforward and neutral ensures that you’re focusing on what the product really needs.</p></dd>
<dt>Consistency is key</dt><dd><p>You want to keep the same tone from start to finish. Think of it as following a recipe. If you start switching things up halfway, you’re going to end up with a mess. Consistency makes these often hefty documents easier to digest.</p></dd>
<dt>Keeping the focus on the product</dt><dd><p>Remember, the star of the show here is the product and what it’s supposed to do. Keeping a direct tone ensures you don’t stray from the main plot—that is, the functionality and requirements.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>When it comes to an LLM like ChatGPT, writing is one of its strengths. It can really up your game. And yes, you can instruct the LLM to hit the right tone, as with this prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Please draft a comprehensive list of technical requirements for a mobile banking app, ensuring the writing is clear, well structured, and professional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are tons of AI writing tools on the market, each with its own special features to suit whatever kind of writing you’re into. Take Jasper and Writer, for example. They’re great for churning out content and keeping your brand voice consistent. Then you’ve got Grammarly, which is the go-to for nailing grammar and sprucing up your writing style. AI21 and Copy.ai are also in the mix, making content creation a breeze.</p>
<p>Consider Jigyasa Grover<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Grammarly" data-type="indexterm" id="id748"/>, who uses Grammarly for her projects. An expert in machine learning, she wrote a book on the topic, <em>Sculpting Data for ML</em> (2021). According to her:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grammarly is another tool that aids me in drafting technical design documents. I leverage it for proofreading, grammar, punctuation, and style suggestions. It integrates seamlessly with many web browsers and word-processing software. The language fabrication is clear and concise and even customizes suggestions based on the target audience and purpose of the document<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_softwareprojectwithAIassistancerequirementsdocuments.07.189.26" data-type="indexterm" id="id749"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_requirementsdocumentsproject.07.189.26" data-type="indexterm" id="id750"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Approaches to Project Planning" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="approaches_to_project_planning">
<h1>Approaches to Project Planning</h1>
<p>After you have put together the requirements, the next step is to plan<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="software project with AI assistance" data-secondary="planning approaches" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_softwareprojectwithAIassistanceplanningapproaches.07.297.74"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="planning approaches for projects" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_planningapproachesforprojects.07.297.74"/> how you’ll approach the project. This is about laying out the game plan for how your team will tackle the software creation journey. It involves setting clear goals and figuring out what you need to do, who’s doing what, when it’s happening, and how. The main objective is to keep things running smoothly, make sure everyone’s productive, and, in the end, have a product that does what it’s supposed to do and makes everyone, especially the customers, happy.</p>
<p>Now, the world of software development is certainly complex, so there are a bunch of different ways that teams can plan their projects. They each have varying strategies, each with their own rules, and steps to help people handle their tasks, deal with any changes, keep the quality up, and deliver something awesome to their clients. So whether your team needs everything spelled out in detail or prefers a more go-with-the-flow kind of plan that can change on the fly, there’s a method out there for you.</p>
<p>Some common project-planning approaches are waterfall, Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP). Picking the right one is important because it can make or break your project. Your choice depends on many factors like how big and complex your project is, what your client needs, how your team works together, and how certain or uncertain things are in your project world. Some teams might stick to one method, but others might mix and match to find the perfect fit for their project.</p>
<p>As for prompts, let’s take an example. Suppose you are building a “to-do list” app. You have created a one-page requirements document for it, and now you ask ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What is the best project planning approach for this app?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT suggests the Agile<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Agile project planning method" data-type="indexterm" id="id751"/> method as the best option and provides reasons (<a data-type="xref" href="#chatgpt_explains_why_agile_is_the_best_a">Figure 7-6</a>).</p>

<p>Here’s a look at some other prompts you might use:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How can teams effectively select and tailor a project-planning approach to fit their specific software project?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Discuss the importance of aligning a project-planning approach with the goals and complexity of a software project.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Explain the sequential phases of the waterfall model in software project management.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Describe the core principles of Agile methodology in software development.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How does Agile methodology facilitate flexibility and customer involvement in a project?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Outline the roles and ceremonies involved in the Scrum framework.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Compare and contrast Scrum and traditional project management approaches.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> List the key practices of Extreme Programming and how they contribute to customer satisfaction.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Discuss the benefits and challenges of implementing test-driven development as part of XP.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Test-Driven Development (TDD)" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="testhyphendriven_development_left_parent">
<h2>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</h2>
<p>One of the smartest things you can do before you start coding is to map out your test<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="test-driven development (TDD)" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_testdrivendevelopmentTDD.07.323.89"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="TDD (test-driven development)" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_TDDtestdrivendevelopment.07.323.89"/> cases. Remember the old saying “Measure twice, cut once”? It’s good advice. You want to get ready before you dive in. A common approach is <em>test-driven development</em> (TDD).</p>
<p class="pagebreak-before">Here’s the deal: when you sit down and think about all the tests your code needs to pass, you get a much better understanding of what you need to build. You’re taking a good, hard look at the blueprint before you start building. This way, you know exactly what your code should do, which saves you from a lot of head-scratching later on.</p>
<p>What’s more, planning your tests first means you’re thinking about the people who’ll use your software right from the start. You’re not just lost in code. You’re focused on making something that works for users. It’s better to spot potential headaches early on than to tear your hair out fixing bugs later.</p>
<p>In TDD, this approach is at the heart and soul of the whole thing. You write your tests before you code, which means you’re always focused on what the code needs to achieve. This approach leads to cleaner, more straightforward code because you’re always coding with a purpose.</p>
<p>With TDD, there’s a toolkit for the different ways to write our tests:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Given-When-Then (GWT)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Given-When-Then (GWT) methodology" data-type="indexterm" id="id752"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GWT (Given-When-Then) methodology" data-type="indexterm" id="id753"/></dt><dd><p>The Given is setting the stage, such as where everything’s at before the action starts. Then you hit the When stage, the main event that gets things rolling. And you wrap up with Then, where you spell out what you expect to happen after the dust settles. It’s like telling a story of what your code will carry out.</p></dd>
<dt>Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) methodology" data-type="indexterm" id="id754"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) methodology" data-type="indexterm" id="id755"/></dt><dd><p>This is similar to GWT. But GWT tends to be more narrative and user-centric, making it ideal for collaboration among developers, testers, and nontechnical stakeholders. AAA, on the other hand, is more about the technical execution of the test itself.</p></dd>
<dt>Setup-Exercise-Verify-Teardown (SEVT)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Setup-Exercise-Verify-Teardown (SEVT) methodology" data-type="indexterm" id="id756"/></dt><dd><p>This is your go-to when you’re in the trenches of integration and systems testing. You start with Setup, where you prep your testing ground. Then, you jump into Exercise, where you run your system through its paces. After this, you go to Verify, which is where you play detective to confirm everything worked out. And don’t forget the Teardown. This is the cleanup step that’s essential to keeping everything neat for next time.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>Here’s an example of a prompt for TDD, using GWT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Formulate a testing approach for critical features using the Given-When-Then methodology. The specific requirements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop an online booking system for a chain of boutique hotels.</p></li>
<li><p>The system must pull room availability data from each hotel’s internal management software.</p></li>
<li><p>It should allow users to filter rooms by date, price, and amenities.</p></li>
<li><p>The interface needs to be intuitive and compatible with both desktop and mobile browsers.</p></li>
<li><p>The system should be built using cloud-based solutions to ensure reliability and scalability.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>TDD also often focuses on specific scenarios or use cases that need to be tested. Here are several types of prompts that can be useful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Write tests for a feature that allows users to reset their password via email verification.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Create tests to verify the system’s response when the database connection fails.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Develop tests to ensure that the search functionality returns results within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Write tests to check that all user data is encrypted when stored.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Design tests to verify the integration between the payment gateway and the order-processing system<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_testdrivendevelopmentTDD.07.323.89" data-type="indexterm" id="id757"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_TDDtestdrivendevelopment.07.323.89" data-type="indexterm" id="id758"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Planning Web Design" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="planning_web_design">
<h2>Planning Web Design</h2>
<p>Planning a website<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="web development" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_webdevelopment.07.355.22"/> or web app can be complex and involve numerous steps. First, you need to understand the goals for the site and the target users. Then, you will sketch out the website’s blueprint and plan how users will move around. This is often known as the <em>prototype</em> or <em>wireframe</em>.</p>
<p>After this, it’s about making it look good by picking colors, fonts, and snazzy graphics that show off what the brand’s all about. Of course, you need some catchy words and cool pictures or videos to tell your story. Then comes the geeky part, where you turn all these ideas into a real, working website using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Of course, a tool like ChatGPT can be helpful when you’re going through the planning stages. Here are some prompts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I’m developing a website for &lt;<em>a certain category</em>&gt;. Suggest some objectives or goals. Who would be the target audience?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What are the pages I need for the basic layout of an online store?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I’m working on a wireframe for a blog’s main page. Could you suggest some important elements to include?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I’m drafting a wireframe for a landing page of a mobile app. What essential sections should I make sure to incorporate?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> For a website about &lt;<em>a certain category</em>&gt;, what would be good ideas for content, say blog posts, videos, and infographics?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How will you structure the navigation of your site to make it intuitive and user-friendly for your audience?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> List the key SEO strategies you will implement to improve your website’s visibility in search engines.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What color palette do you envision for my website about &lt;<em>a particular category</em>&gt;?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Select font styles for your website about &lt;<em>a particular <span class="keep-together">category</span></em>&gt;. Consider readability and brand alignment and how the fonts contribute to the overall aesthetic of the site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also various tools that use AI to help create wireframes<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="wireframes for web design" data-type="indexterm" id="id759"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Uizard" data-type="indexterm" id="id760"/>. One is Uizard. Similar to a system like Figma, it has design functions, such as the ability to drag-and-drop elements like buttons and forms. It can also be used by teams to collaborate.</p>
<p>The AI features are located on the toolbar on the left of the dashboard. The button is called Magic. Click it, and you will see a list of AI features.</p>
<p>To create a wireframe, select Autodesigner and this will bring up a wizard, which you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#uizard_has_an_ai_wizard_to_help_create_a">Figure 7-7</a>.</p>

<p>First, you will select the device to design for: mobile, tablet, or web. Then, you will describe the project. You may provide just a sentence or two. Here is an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> A website that connects freelance chefs with people hosting dinner parties or special events.</p>
