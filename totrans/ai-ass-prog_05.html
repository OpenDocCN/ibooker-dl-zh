<h1><span class="label">Chapter 4. </span>GitHub Copilot</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we’re going to check out GitHub Copilot<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_GitHubCopilot.04.3.60"/>, which I’ll refer to as Copilot for short. It’s the big dog in the AI coding assistant world. People even call it a “killer application” of generative AI. This is primarily due to its advanced code suggestion, creation, and explanation capabilities, which significantly enhance developer productivity. By understanding and predicting coding patterns based on context, it not only saves time but also assists in writing more efficient and error-free code.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll dive into the nitty-gritty of Copilot: how much it costs, how to set it up, and all the cool features it offers. And we’ll be real about its downsides too. Plus, I’ll toss in some handy tips to get the most out of it. We’re not stopping there: we’ll also see how Copilot is teaming up with other companies with the Copilot Partner Program. This chapter is all about seeing the full scope of what Copilot can do.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="GitHub Copilot" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="github_copilot-id00003">
<h1>GitHub Copilot</h1>
<p>Back in June 2021, Microsoft unveiled GitHub Copilot. GitHub’s CEO, Nat Friedman<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Friedman, Nat" data-type="indexterm" id="id482"/>, described it in a <a href="https://oreil.ly/L4JcE">blog post</a> as an “AI pair programmer,” designed to speed up developers’ work by assisting them in completing tasks more efficiently.</p>
<p>Copilot is the result of a partnership between Microsoft<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Microsoft, and Copilot" data-type="indexterm" id="id483"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenAI" data-seealso="ChatGPT" data-type="indexterm" id="id484"/> and OpenAI. Initially, it harnessed a large language model named Codex<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Codex" data-type="indexterm" id="id485"/>, a variant of GPT-3 tailored for coding. Microsoft enhanced this LLM’s capabilities by integrating a new approach<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="fill-in-the-middle (FIM), LLM approach" data-type="indexterm" id="id486"/> known as <em>fill-in-the-middle</em> (FIM), which better understands code context. This improved the quality of code suggestions and shortened response times. Powered by the more advanced GPT-3.5 Turbo<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GPT-3.5 Turbo" data-type="indexterm" id="id487"/>, this enhancement led to a noticeable uptick in the acceptance rate of code suggestions. To improve security, the tool incorporated an AI <span class="keep-together">system</span> to instantly block risky coding patterns, focusing on vulnerabilities such as hardcoded credentials and SQL injections.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Pricing and Versions" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="pricing_and_versions">
<h2>Pricing and Versions</h2>
<p>A 30-day free trial<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="pricing and versions" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_GitHubCopilotpricingandversions.04.11.23"/> of Copilot is available. Once that’s up, you’ve got three choices.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Copilot for Individuals</dt>
<dd><p>This plan costs $10 a month or $100 for an annual subscription. It offers features like multi-line function suggestions that can make your coding workflow smoother. A standout feature is its ability to accelerate test generation, a key factor in making sure your code is reliable and solid. Plus, it’s got a feature to screen out vulnerable coding patterns. It also prevents any suggestions that might mirror public code, ensuring that what you create is unique and original.</p></dd>
<dt>Copilot for Business</dt>
<dd><p>This package is more comprehensive and costs $19 per user per month. It includes everything from the Copilot for Individuals plan and some extra perks designed for businesses. It streamlines license management, which is a big plus for companies in handling their subscriptions and access. There’s also a feature for managing policies across the organization, helping to ensure uniformity in governance and consistency in all projects. A key highlight is its top-notch privacy safeguards, which are crucial for keeping sensitive business data secure. Additionally, it supports corporate proxies, guaranteeing secure and smooth connectivity throughout the company’s network.</p></dd>
<dt>GitHub Copilot Enterprise</dt>
<dd><p>This comes with a fee of $39 per month per user. The Enterprise plan’s key feature is that it allows for training the system on internal codebases. The Enterprise version bumps up the efficiency of developers, because the tool starts giving more spot-on code suggestions. It helps push for adopting better practices and sticking to security rules. It’s tailored to fit the way developers code internally and their favorite APIs, frameworks, and packages.</p>
<p>Another advantage of the Enterprise version is that you can train it on classic languages like COBOL and Fortran. General-purpose LLMs might not be as effective with these because there’s a lack of training data from public repositories. Of course, they wouldn’t have any clue about proprietary languages specific to your company.</p>
<p>The GitHub system also strengthens the model for the Enterprise edition by continuously scanning a company’s repositories. For instance, it zeroes in on recent pull requests and merges as well as thumbs-up and thumbs-down feedback. All this helps to spotlight the latest methods and strategies a company is using.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p class="pagebreak-before">Having custom models helps spread know-how across the organization. The AI picks up and shares the subtle knowledge tucked away in the code. With ongoing training, the AI keeps pace with the changing codebase, making its help even more precise as time goes on. Still, it’s really important for organizations to handle the privacy and intellectual property risks that come with mixing these AI tools into their development process.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>In 2023, <a href="https://oreil.ly/zXAQ-">Gartner’s research</a> showed that less than 10% of large enterprises<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="enterprise use of AI-assisted programming" data-type="indexterm" id="id488"/> had started using AI-assisted programming tools. This hesitancy is partly due to worries about security and precision. However, with the rapid advancements in the technology, it’s expected that more and more businesses will start adopting these tools in the near future. In short, the benefits they offer are just too significant to overlook<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_GitHubCopilotpricingandversions.04.11.23" data-type="indexterm" id="id489"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Use Case: Programming Hardware" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="use_casecolon_programming_hardware">
<h2>Use Case: Programming Hardware</h2>
<p>An interesting case study<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="programming hardware use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id490"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hardware programming use case (Copilot)" data-type="indexterm" id="id491"/> of custom models concerns Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)" data-type="indexterm" id="id492"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)" data-type="indexterm" id="id493"/>. Founded in 1969, the company is a pioneer of CPUs (central processing units). Today the company is a <a href="https://oreil.ly/pOoMj">leader</a> in semiconductors for data centers, embedded systems, gaming platforms, and PCs.</p>
<p>Before diving in, let’s set the stage by reviewing some basics about developing for hardware systems. It’s a whole different ballgame than building software for something like a web app. The key challenge is that developers need to know the hardware system inside out. Unlike regular software, which works on all-purpose computers, firmware talks directly to the hardware. This demands a kind of precision and compatibility that’s much more exacting.</p>
<p>This level of precision is critical because mistakes in firmware development<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="firmware development use case, Copilot" data-type="indexterm" id="id494"/> can lead to some seriously expensive consequences. Just one error might mean a financial hit in the millions. And it’s not just about the money—time is a huge factor too. Fixing a firmware issue usually involves revisiting the manufacturing process, and that can add months to the timeline. Such a delay affects not just the release schedule but also how competitive the product is in the market.</p>
<p>Clearly, the “move fast and break things” mindset common in Agile software development doesn’t work in this setting. The risks are too big for this approach. That’s why firmware developers have to put considerable time and effort into making detailed plans and doing extensive testing. This careful approach makes sure the firmware is as solid and error-free as it can be before it gets paired with the hardware.</p>
<p class="pagebreak-before">When AMD took a look at Copilot in 2023, it set really high standards, and there was a fair amount of understandable skepticism. In a pilot project, AMD created a custom version of Copilot for various <em>hardware description languages</em> (HDLs) like Verilog and SystemVerilog<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hardware description languages (HDLs)" data-type="indexterm" id="id495"/>. HDLs are specific types of programming languages tailored for outlining the architecture, design, and function of electronic circuits, especially the digital logic ones. They’re crucial for modeling and simulating electronic systems at different levels of abstraction.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://oreil.ly/TXMvQ">results of the pilot</a> turned out much better than anticipated. Surprisingly, the style of the code generated by Copilot actually aligned more with AMD’s standards than what their own programmers were producing. The improvement was so significant that some of the programmers even switched from using Vim, a highly customizable text editor, to adopting Visual Studio Code<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Visual Studio Code (VS Code)" data-type="indexterm" id="id496"/> as their IDE.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Use Case: Shopify" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="use_casecolon_shopify">
<h2>Use Case: Shopify</h2>
<p>Another interesting case study is Shopify<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="Shopify use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id497"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Shopify use case (Copilot)" data-type="indexterm" id="id498"/>. This company runs a platform that lets customers set up ecommerce websites. Shopify has about 10% of the market in the United States and 6% in Europe.</p>
<p>No doubt, this has created a need for a massive infrastructure. Consider that there are around 300 public repositories and about 5,000 private ones. Plus, Shopify is doing about 1,500 deployments to their code every day.</p>
<p>Shopify was one of the first companies to jump on the Copilot bandwagon, and it’s been a game-changer for making developers more productive. Currently, close to <a href="https://oreil.ly/ZI_9K">2,000 Shopify developers use the tool</a>. And here’s the cool part: 70% of them say it’s helpful, and 75% use it a lot. About 26% of the code suggestions from Copilot are accepted.</p>
<p>Sure, there are a few features that haven’t caught on, like the integration with the command-line interface (CLI). But despite this, many developers use code completion and chat on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Here are some interesting takeaways:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Value of code suggestions<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="code suggestions" data-secondary="value of" data-type="indexterm" id="id499"/></dt><dd><p>Even if a developer doesn’t use a given suggestion, it’s not a total loss. Any suggestion can spark ideas for writing even better code.</p></dd>
<dt>Rate of adoption</dt><dd><p>Usage usually picks up as time goes on, which should not be surprising. It takes time to tweak daily workflows and get used to new features. There’s also a learning curve with Copilot.</p></dd>
<dt>Uptake by senior developers</dt><dd><p>In the early days of adoption of Copilot, the more experienced developers weren’t too keen on using it. They tended to view it as more of a toy than a serious tool. But as time went on and they noticed other developers getting real results, they started to warm up to it.</p></dd>
<dt>Learning enhancement</dt><dd><p>Shopify noticed that Copilot is good at nudging people to try out a new language or framework. For example, there was a noticeable uptick in adoption of Rust.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>About a million lines of the Shopify codebase has been written using this tool, showing that Copilot is a very big deal for this business.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Use Case: Accenture" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="use_casecolon_accenture">
<h2>Use Case: Accenture</h2>
<p>Accenture<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="Accenture use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id500"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Accenture" data-type="indexterm" id="id501"/> is a massive professional services organization that helps clients improve operations and growth through innovative technologies and systems. The company has over <a href="https://investor.accenture.com">733,000 employees</a> in more than 120 <span class="keep-together">countries</span>.</p>
<p>In 2023, Accenture tested Copilot with <a href="https://oreil.ly/ku8Nd">450 of its internal developers</a>. The firm didn’t set any specific tasks or objectives. Instead, managers just asked everyone to go about their work as they normally would.</p>
<p>The trial with Copilot at Accenture spanned six months. So, what happened? In terms of coding, there was a 35% rate of acceptance of Copilot’s suggestions<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="code suggestions" data-secondary="Accenture’s uptake of" data-type="indexterm" id="id502"/>, with 88% of those changes sticking even after code reviews. Productivity saw a remarkable boost, too. There was a 50% increase in pull requests and a 15% rise in the merge rate. Efficiency also made a big leap forward, with 50% more builds and a 45% increase in their success rate. And the developers? They were really happy with it: a whopping 96% felt they were successful from day one.</p>
<p>Upon seeing these results, Accenture made the call to roll out Copilot globally to its <a href="https://oreil.ly/UgdoL">50,000 developers</a>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Security" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="security-id00004">
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Gartner <a href="https://oreil.ly/k1oVc">surveyed</a> more than 2,000 chief information officers (CIOs) and discovered that 66% of them plan to invest the most resources in cyber- and information security<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="security" data-type="indexterm" id="id503"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="security" data-secondary="Copilot" data-type="indexterm" id="id504"/> in 2023. This trend has been consistent for years.</p>
<p>At a time when cyber<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cybersecurity" data-type="indexterm" id="id505"/> threats are becoming more complex and widespread, a security breach could mean big financial losses, harm to reputation, legal troubles, and disruptions in operations. Plus, with data privacy regulations getting stricter, CIOs have to be vigilant about compliance to dodge fines and keep customer trust.</p>
<p>That’s why for GitHub, security is a major focus of its Copilot program. GitHub has developed a system based on LLMs that spots and fixes insecure coding patterns right as they happen.</p>
<p>Then there are also GitHub’s <a href="https://oreil.ly/fZamu">Advanced Security features</a> assisted by Copilot. Here are the main ones:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Code scanning</dt>
<dd><p>In real time, Advanced Security will search for security vulnerabilities and coding errors.</p></dd>
<dt>Secret scanning</dt>
<dd><p>The product can root out secrets like keys and tokens that have been checked into private repositories.</p></dd>
<dt>Dependency review</dt>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Codespaces and Visual Studio Code" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="codespaces_and_visual_studio_code">
<h2>Codespaces and Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p>There are two ways to use Copilot. One way is to access it through Codespaces<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="Codespaces on VS Code" data-type="indexterm" id="id507"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Codespaces on VS Code" data-type="indexterm" id="id508"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Visual Studio Code (VS Code)" data-secondary="Codespaces in Copilot" data-type="indexterm" id="id509"/>, a cloud-based development environment that runs on Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and is available directly on <a href="https://github.com"><em>https://github.com</em></a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can opt for the Copilot extension if you’re using the desktop version of Visual Studio Code. In this book, we’re going to focus on using the VS Code extension.</p>
<p class="pagebreak-before">The IDE itself is free. <a data-type="xref" href="#the_main_screen_for_visual_studio_code_i">Figure 4-2</a> shows the main screen of VS Code. You can run this system on various platforms<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="integrated development environments (IDEs)" data-type="indexterm" id="id510"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="operating system platforms" data-type="indexterm" id="id511"/>, including Windows (versions 7, 8, 10, and 11); macOS; and various Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and more.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 4-2. </span>The main screen for Visual Studio Code includes an Activity Bar and an area to generate and display code</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>On the left is the Activity Bar, which is a stack of icons. You can use these for loading files and folders. You can also select the fifth icon, which is the group of squares, to go to the area to install extensions (<a data-type="xref" href="#you_can_install_extensions_in_vs_codecom">Figure 4-3</a>).</p>

<p>If you enter “GitHub Copilot” in the search box, you’ll see a list of extensions. Select the top one and click Install.</p>
<p>Then look at the bottom right of the screen. If you see the Copilot icon, then you have the service available.</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="you_can_install_extensions_in_vs_codecom">

<h6><span class="label">Figure 4-3. </span>You can install extensions in VS Code, such as for Copilot</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>In the middle of the screen, you will see the code to print “Hello, Copilot!” This was created by using the following prompt, which Copilot turned into code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> # write a “Hello, Copilot!” program</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The # character specifies a comment<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="# (hashtag character), for comments" data-type="indexterm" id="id512"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="comments" data-secondary="hashtag (#) for" data-type="indexterm" id="id513"/>. This is one of the ways to instruct Copilot to generate code.</p>
<p>Notice that the code is in Python. Why so? The extension for the file is <em>py</em>. Copilot uses the file extension to determine what language to use.</p>
<p>At the top right of the screen, there is an icon to run the program. Click it, and VS Code will launch the terminal. You will then see the message printed out.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Suggestions" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="suggestions">
<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<p>Getting started with Copilot in VS Code is straightforward. As you begin typing your code, the tool kicks in, offering you code suggestions<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="code suggestions" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_GitHubCopilotcodesuggestions.04.112.143"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="code suggestions" data-secondary="Copilot" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_codesuggestionsCopilot.04.112.143"/> and generating code snippets based on your input.</p>
<p>Suppose you type the header for a function in Python:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting"><strong>def find_factorial(number):</strong></pre>
<p class="pagebreak-before">Copilot will promptly suggest a complete function body, as you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#copilot_suggests_code_when_a_user_writes">Figure 4-4</a>. This generated coding<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ghost text" data-type="indexterm" id="id514"/> is called <em>ghost text</em> and is highlighted in gray.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 4-4. </span>Copilot suggests code when a user writes a function header</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>Keep in mind that the code might look a bit different on your machine, and that’s normal since the underlying LLM works according to a complex set of probabilities.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: GitHub gets that you’re trying to write a function for calculating a factorial based on a parameter. So, it suggests the If–Then structure you need to get the right result.</p>
<p>You can hit Tab to accept the code suggestion. But if it’s not what you’re looking for, just press the Escape key to skip it.</p>
<p>If you hover over the generated code, you will see some more options, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#hovering_over_the_generated_code_evokes">Figure 4-5</a>.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 4-5. </span>Hovering over the generated code evokes more options, visible at the upper right</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>You can click Accept to accept the code suggestion, just like pressing the Tab key, or you can select Accept Word to select one word in the code at a time. If you click the three dots, you will get a menu for either accepting a line or to always show the <span class="keep-together">toolbar</span>.</p>
<p>Clicking on the 1/2 on the left lets you see alternatives for the generated code; in <a data-type="xref" href="#hovering_over_the_generated_code_evokes">Figure 4-5</a>, there are two alternatives, and the first one is currently showing. Clicking “&gt;” would take you to version 2. Then clicking “&lt;” would take you back to version 1.</p>
<p>You can also use the shortcut keys listed in <a data-type="xref" href="#shortcut_keys_for_scrolling_through_code">Table 4-1</a> to navigate the options.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Earlier, in <a data-type="xref" href="#codespaces_and_visual_studio_code">“Codespaces and Visual Studio Code”</a>, we looked at how you can prompt Copilot to generate code using one or more comments<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="generating comments" data-type="indexterm" id="id517"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="comments" data-secondary="Copilot" data-type="indexterm" id="id518"/>. To do this, you indicate the comment in the syntax of the programming language you’re working in.</p>
<p>But you can do more. You can use comments to interact with the system as if it were ChatGPT<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-secondary="and comments to prompt Copilot" data-secondary-sortas="comments to prompt Copilot" data-type="indexterm" id="id519"/>. Let’s check out an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> # q: What is a class in object-oriented programming?</p>
<p><em>Copilot:</em> # a: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object has properties and methods (functions) associated with it. Almost everything in Python is an object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see the answer is also in the context of the language you are coding in. Now say you ask Copilot about how the system works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> # q: What is the shortcut for accepting an inline suggestion?</p>
<p><em>Copilot:</em> # a: tab</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can ask Copilot about features of VS Code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> # q: What is the shortcut for the user settings in VS Code?</p>
<p><em>Copilot:</em> # a: Ctrl + ,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also ask it about shortcut keys for other IDEs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> # q: What is the shortcut for a new file in the Atom editor?</p>
<p><em>Copilot:</em> # a: ctrl + n</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that Copilot knows I’m on a Windows system and provides the code based on this platform.</p>

<p>You can dive into Chat right from <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a>. It’s great for analyzing code, handling pull requests, peeking at documentation, or just asking whatever coding questions you’ve got. Plus, Chat is available on the GitHub apps for both iOS and Android, so you can take it with you on the go.</p>
<p>But right now, let’s focus on how this works with VS Code<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Visual Studio Code (VS Code)" data-secondary="and Copilot Chat" data-secondary-sortas="Copilot Chat" data-type="indexterm" id="id520"/>. This means adding a new extension. Just look up “GitHub Copilot Chat.” Once you install it, you’ll see a new icon pop up on the left side of your screen. It’s got two little chat bubbles, as you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#an_icon_for_chat_has_appeared_on_the_lef">Figure 4-7</a>.</p>
<figure><div class="figure" id="an_icon_for_chat_has_appeared_on_the_lef">
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0407.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 4-7. </span>An icon for Chat has appeared on the left of the screen</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>At the top of the Chat panel, you see a group of icons in a menu. The first, consisting of horizontal lines and a small x, clears all your chat threads. This is important due to the way context works. When you type in a prompt, the LLM checks out the conversation history. If your chat’s all over the place topic-wise, you might end up with some less-than-helpful answers. That’s why it’s a good idea to keep each chat focused on a particular topic and start new chats for new topics.</p>
<p>The next icon, with a person and a chat bubble, allows you to send feedback about the system. Then there is the history button, a clock, which shows the prior threads.</p>
<p>If you click the three dots, you can use the chat inside the editor, where there is a lot more room for your chats.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the Chat box, there is an input area to ask a question of the system.</p>
<p>The Chat system has numerous shortcuts. One is @workspace<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="@workspace shortcut, Copilot Chat" data-primary-sortas="workspace shortcut, Copilot Chat" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_workspaceshortcutCopilotChat.04.203.61"/>, which refers to the files open in your workspace. For example, if you have a calculator program in Python, you can enter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> @workspace /explain</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#chat_can_be_used_to_explain_codecomma_fo">Figure 4-8</a> shows that Chat has analyzed the program file and provided an in-depth explanation.</p>
<figure><div class="figure" id="chat_can_be_used_to_explain_codecomma_fo">
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0408.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 4-8. </span>Chat can be used to explain code, for example, a calculator program</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>You can ask Chat to explain just a part of the code. Highlight the section you’re interested in and press the right button on your mouse. This will bring up a menu (<a data-type="xref" href="#focus_the_chat_on_a_segment_of_your_code">Figure 4-9</a>).</p>
<figure><div class="figure" id="focus_the_chat_on_a_segment_of_your_code">
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0409.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 4-9. </span>Focus the chat on a segment of your code by highlighting it and pressing the right mouse button</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>When you’ve told Chat to focus on just part of the code, you can not only explain the code but also fix it, generate documentation, or create tests<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_workspaceshortcutCopilotChat.04.203.61" data-type="indexterm" id="id521"/>.</p>
<p>Another helpful shortcut is the /new command<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="/new command, Copilot shortcut" data-primary-sortas="new command, Copilot shortcut" data-type="indexterm" id="id522"/>. It will create a scaffold for a new project or feature. Here are some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /new Create a Python script to scrape data from a website</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /new Generate a Java class for a student with fields for name, age, and grade</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /new Build a simple REST API using Flask</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /new Create a JavaScript function to sort an array of numbers in ascending order</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /new Design a SQL database schema for a blog, with tables for users, posts, and comments</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In response to these prompts, the Chat system will show the main steps and then provide the code listing. You also have several options for what to do with it. As you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#at_the_top_of_the_code_listing_for_chatc">Figure 4-10</a>, there is a menu bar at the top.</p>
<figure><div class="figure" id="at_the_top_of_the_code_listing_for_chatc">
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0410.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 4-10. </span>At the top of the code listing for Chat, there are options for what to do with the code</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>The first icon will copy the code, and the next one will insert it where the cursor is in the file (you can also use Ctrl+Enter). If you select the three dots, you can insert the code into a new file or the terminal.</p>
<p>There’s also a shortcut for creating a new Jupyter Notebook<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Jupyter Notebook, creating with Copilot" data-type="indexterm" id="id523"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="/newNotebook command, Copilot Chat" data-primary-sortas="newNotebook command, Copilot Chat" data-type="indexterm" id="id524"/>: /newNotebook. You should specify what you want the notebook to do. Here are some sample prompts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /newNotebook Create a notebook to visualize data from a csv file using matplotlib</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /newNotebook Create a notebook to preprocess and clean a dataset for machine learning</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /newNotebook Create a notebook to implement a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /newNotebook Create a notebook to analyze time series data</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /newNotebook Create a notebook to scrape data from a website and analyze it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chat also provides a /terminal<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="/terminal command, Copilot Chat shortcut" data-primary-sortas="terminal command, Copilot Chat shortcut" data-type="indexterm" id="id525"/> shortcut. You can ask questions about or get help with terminal or command line operations, such as with navigating directories, running scripts, or installing packages. Here are some prompts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /terminal What is the command to list all environment variables?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /terminal How do I use grep to find specific text in multiple files?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /terminal How can I use the find command to search for files by their permissions?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /terminal How do I redirect the output of a command to a file?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /terminal How do I use awk to process text files?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there is @vscode<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="@vscode agent, Copilot Chat" data-primary-sortas="vscode agent, Copilot Chat" data-type="indexterm" id="id526"/>, which is called an <em>agent</em>. With this, you can ask questions or get help about some aspects of VS Code such as a feature, navigation, configuration, or an extension.</p>
<p>Here are some sample prompts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> @vscode How do I split the editor into multiple windows?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> @vscode How can I customize my keyboard shortcuts?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> @vscode How do I set up a multi-root workspace?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> @vscode How do I configure task automation in VS Code?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> @vscode How can I set up and use Docker with VS Code?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, there is the /api command<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="/api command, Copilot Chat" data-primary-sortas="api command, Copilot Chat" data-type="indexterm" id="id527"/>. You can ask questions about or get help with aspects of API development or usage including creation, testing, or integration. Here are some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /api How do I make a POST request with JSON data in Node.js?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /api How can I handle CORS issues in an Express.js API?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /api How do I authenticate a user in a Django REST API?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /api How can I paginate results in a Rails API?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> /api How do I version an API in ASP.NET Core?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also use /api in the context of VS Code<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Visual Studio Code (VS Code)" data-secondary="and /api command in Copilot" data-secondary-sortas="api command in Copilot" data-type="indexterm" id="id528"/>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> @vscode /api How do I create a new command in VS Code extension?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> @vscode /api How can I read and write settings in VS Code extension?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> @vscode /api How do I create a new webview panel in VS Code extension?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> @vscode /api How can I interact with the file system in VS Code Extension?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> @vscode /api How do I add a new item to the activity bar in VS Code Extension?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that if you want to clear the chat, you can use /clear<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="/clear command, Copilot Chat" data-primary-sortas="clear command, Copilot Chat" data-type="indexterm" id="id529"/>.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Inline Chat" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="inline_chat">
<h2>Inline Chat</h2>
<p>You can use the Chat feature inside<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="inline chat (Copilot)" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_inlinechatCopilot.04.277.39"/> your code listing. You will highlight code and then press Ctrl+I for Windows or Cmd+I for macOS. You’ll then see a popup, such as in <a data-type="xref" href="#the_inline_chat_feature_allows_you_to_ch">Figure 4-11</a>.</p>
<figure><div class="figure" id="the_inline_chat_feature_allows_you_to_ch">
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0411.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 4-11. </span>The Inline Chat feature allows you to chat within your code</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>According to GitHub, Inline Chat has become a popular feature. After all, it allows a developer to stay within their “flow.”</p>
<p>You can use the shortcuts—which we described earlier—to ask questions about the code. The explanation will show up on the Chat panel.</p>
<p>Notice that there is also a orange sparkle icon next to the code. If you click it, you will get a few options—to fix the code, explain it, or rewrite it—which you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#pressing_the_yellow_light_bulb_icon_allo">Figure 4-12</a>.</p>
<figure><div class="figure" id="pressing_the_yellow_light_bulb_icon_allo">
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0412.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 4-12. </span>Pressing the orange sparkle icon allows you to interact directly with the code</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>Let’s try an example using Inline Chat. We’ll use this prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Create a function for a bubble sort</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chat creates code for this. But suppose we want to see if there is a faster type of sort. Highlight the function and execute Inline Chat. <a data-type="xref" href="#inline_chat_has_responded_to_a_request_t">Figure 4-13</a> shows the response.</p>
<figure><div class="figure" id="inline_chat_has_responded_to_a_request_t">
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0413.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 4-13. </span>Inline Chat has responded to a request to create a faster sort than the bubble sort on the top</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>Chat suggests a quick sort and shows this in “diff mode.” This allows for comparing and contrasting the two approaches. You can either accept the new code in its entirety or just parts of it<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_GitHubCopilotChatandinlinechat.04.192.16" data-type="indexterm" id="id530"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_chatfunctionCopilot.04.192.16" data-type="indexterm" id="id531"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_inlinechatCopilot.04.277.39" data-type="indexterm" id="id532"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Open Tabs" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="open_tabs">
<h2>Open Tabs</h2>
<p>When you’re working on a standard software development<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="open tabs feature" data-type="indexterm" id="id533"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="open tabs (Copilot)" data-type="indexterm" id="id534"/> project, your IDE is usually packed with a bunch of files, each playing its own part in the app’s framework. Take a web project using React as an example. You’re going to see <em>.jsx</em> and <em>.js</em> files for the components, along with HTML and CSS files, not to mention <em>.json</em> and <em>.env</em> files too.</p>
<p>What does this mean to Copilot? It’s a big help. Copilot gets better the more it understands the context of your work. This means it takes into account everything in the current file you’re working on. As for the other open files, the LLM doesn’t scan them all. It zeroes in on the parts that are relevant to what you’re doing. Also, Copilot does not look at the rest of the files in your project, likely to respect your privacy<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="privacy" data-secondary="Copilot’s respect for file" data-type="indexterm" id="id535"/>.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Command-Line Interface" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="commandhyphenline_interface">
<h2>Command-Line Interface</h2>
<p>You can use Copilot in your CLI<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="CLI" data-type="indexterm" id="id536"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="command line interface (CLI)" data-secondary="Copilot" data-type="indexterm" id="id537"/>. Copilot’s two main functions there are to explain commands and to suggest them.</p>
<p>To do this, you need to install the <a href="https://cli.github.com">GitHub CLI</a> and then log in to your GitHub account:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting"><strong>gh auth login</strong></pre>
<p>Next, you will install Copilot:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting"><strong>gh extension install github/gh-copilot</strong></pre>
<p>You can upgrade the extension:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting"><strong>gh extension upgrade gh-copilot</strong></pre>
<p>Here’s an example of asking Copilot to explain a CLI command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> gh copilot explain xcopy</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#copilot_explains_the_xcopy_command_in_a">Figure 4-14</a> shows the output.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> gh copilot suggest</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, Copilot will ask what type of command you want help with—a generic shell command, a gh command, or a git command—so specify this. Then it will ask what you would like the command to do. Here’s an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What are the commands for viewing and setting environment variables in the system?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#copilotapostrophes_suggest_feature_in_th">Figure 4-15</a> shows Copilot’s response, which includes suggestions for commands to use. You can copy this or ask Copilot for more help, such as to explain the command or revise it.</p>

Thanks to a plugin, developers can speed up database creation using Chat<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="chat function" data-secondary="Copilot" data-type="indexterm" id="id547"/>. For instance, Chat offers code suggestions for a database’s structure and metadata, all in line with coding standards. This leads to code that’s neater and easier to maintain.</p>
<p>To ask a question, use the @datastax tag. Some <a href="https://oreil.ly/4QQrB">sample prompts</a> include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Tell me about my chat_prod database</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Tell me about the schema of a table</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Write a SQL query to read from the chat table</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>Mary-Brenda Akoda, an AI researcher with a patent in the field of AI for ophthalmology, is an avid user of Copilot. She says, “One time, I wrote code for an entire model development process in under an hour using Copilot. This was a task that would typically have demanded a lot more of my time and effort. Interestingly, it is actually when I had to use an online IDE that didn’t support Copilot that I realized how tedious and slow the development process can be.”</p>
