<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When I decided to write this book, I wanted to give you a chance to understand the history of Tableau. I also wanted to give you a grounding and understanding of what artificial intelligence (AI) is. And finally, I wanted to address the impacts of this new technology, not only in analytics but also in the world. My goal in these decisions is to ensure that we are on the same page throughout the book, we are speaking the same language, and we’re addressing some important issues early on so that they aren’t neglected. Often I’ve found in our profession, the lack of saying things leads to confusion or the prolonging of important discussions, so instead, let’s get started.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="A Brief History of Tableau" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="pr01_a_brief_history_of_tableau_1732595610180560">&#13;
<h1>A Brief History of Tableau</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Tableau <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau" data-secondary="history of" data-type="indexterm" id="kab001"/>was founded in 2003 as a by-product of a Stanford research project and dissertation. The key innovation behind the software is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="VizQL" data-type="indexterm" id="id221"/>VizQL, a visual query language that allows those working with data to drag and drop fields in data sets on a canvas to query and answer questions. It’s a very intuitive system because all in-depth coding and manipulation of the data is done within the VizQL engine, and the person dragging and dropping gets direct visual feedback in the form of charts and graphs. I was first introduced to this technology around 2015, and to date I haven’t seen a more intuitive way to analyze and work with data.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In 2007, the software expanded to include <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Server" data-type="indexterm" id="id222"/>Tableau Server—a way to host and publish visualizations to true audience members and end users (not just those who create the charts)—and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Reader" data-type="indexterm" id="id223"/>Tableau Reader, a free application that allowed anyone to access and open Tableau files, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="workbooks" data-type="indexterm" id="id224"/>called <em>workbooks</em>, locally. This improvement paved the way for what is a big part of modern analytics, the idea <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="self-service analytics" data-type="indexterm" id="id225"/>of <em>self-service analytics</em>. With the inclusion of these two products, now someone could build charts and share them with anyone who was looking to use data as an aid in decision making or understanding. The responsibility and cycle of reaching out to a data analyst for answers to data-related questions was shifted back to the end user, with the goal that they become more empowered and able to answer their own questions, to explore the data, and to know it more intimately.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>From 2007 to 2016, Tableau continued to improve upon its core product, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Desktop" data-type="indexterm" id="id226"/>Tableau Desktop. Some of the most powerful innovations at the time were the inclusion of connectors to a myriad of databases and data sources. Data professionals using the tool could connect to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets with hand-constructed budget numbers and could also connect to larger databases holding transactional data. To this day, Tableau continues to be unique in the data tools landscape because it takes what I like to call <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data agnostic approach" data-type="indexterm" id="id227"/>a <em>data agnostic</em> approach. Most business intelligence (BI) tools thrive on connecting to specific data sources (like Microsoft’s legacy SSRS and SSAS) within an application stack (Microsoft), somehow making the visual analytics component the last step in the process. Tableau upends this paradigm by taking the data as it is, wherever it is, squarely aiming to make the job of the data analyst easier: easier to access data, analyze it, understand it, and disseminate it.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Beyond the continued improvements in data connectivity, Tableau added in the ability to <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="level of detail (LOD) expressions" data-type="indexterm" id="id228"/>construct <em>level of detail</em><em> </em>(<em>LOD</em>)<em> </em><em>expressions</em> in version 9. This gave Tableau visualization creators the ability to define unique aggregations for calculations independent of the aggregations and fields represented in a chart. I started using Tableau right before this feature was released, so I have a very strong sense of what was possible and the impact of this improvement. Suddenly, deeply complex queries and comparisons could be made within data sets, all in the same chart. At the time, I was working as an analyst in healthcare, and I remember being amazed at how I could now show zoomed-in data, like the best-performing provider, against a state, regional, and national average—all in one chart.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It was also around this time (2016) that Tableau released version 10. This introduced a modern user interface, a bespoke Tableau font, and the ability to relate, both by unions and more importantly by joins, tables across different databases. Suddenly, as an analyst, you could more easily enrich data that was disparate. Combining information from multiple systems without the prerequisite of a data warehouse or single-source repository was now possible (for die-hard Tableau users, data blending has been available since 2010, but with extreme limitations). Requests I made as an analyst changed from asking IT for constructed data sets to asking for direct access to databases. The unbelievable power of accessing the raw data was exciting. As an analyst, this access gave me a better understanding of the applications used for the business: I could now understand how it was really organized and what data was really there. It filled in a lot of gaps of whether certain types of analysis were possible.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>From this period of time to the end of 2019, Tableau started addressing two new problems: data access, storage, and management; and analytics tools beyond visualizations and dashboards. This shift was a significant milestone, quietly signifying that its visual analytics product was now quite mature and there was now space to spread into other areas of enterprise analytics.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>On the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data access, storage, and management" data-type="indexterm" id="id229"/>data access, storage, and management front, Tableau introduced <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Prep Builder" data-type="indexterm" id="id230"/>Prep Builder (its data preparation tool), a new proprietary data storage format (Hyper), and eventually a data catalog. All these innovations represented massive improvements to the quality of life of an analytics team working with data. Teams were now getting legitimate data preparation tools that rivaled SQL in terms of query and cleaning capabilities with the intuitive and visual interface Tableau is known for. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Hyper" data-type="indexterm" id="id231"/>Hyper, the name for Tableau <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data extracts" data-type="indexterm" id="id232"/>data extracts, allowed underlying data sets to be larger, with both more rows and columns. All analytical operations on dashboards became faster. Data started to get less aggregated underneath the dashboards, allowing for analysis at both the macro (executive) and the micro (data analyst) levels, all in the same space and at the same time. It was now easier to point to the exact record of data that was contributing to a monthly trend line. The data catalog addition helped legitimize <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Server" data-type="indexterm" id="id233"/>Tableau Server as an enterprise-level BI platform—marking the change of Tableau from being categorized as a pretty dashboarding tool to a more complete BI solution.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As I mentioned, it was also during this time that Tableau started working on two innovations unrelated to visual analytics:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Ask Data</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>A <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Ask Data" data-type="indexterm" id="id234"/>natural language querying tool (released in 2019)</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Explain Data</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>A <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Explain Data" data-type="indexterm" id="id235"/>statistical analysis tool that surfaced interesting statistical facts as the user created charts</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Looking back on this now, it is clear to see that these innovations were a precursor to AI, but at the time it was a little bit harder to see it that way. The introduction of Ask Data introduced a lot of anxiety to data practitioners. Previously, they had been able to control and check that any questions an end user asks of a dashboard would surface factually accurate answers. But with a language interpretation engine spitting out figures to someone less familiar with how to analyze data, it was tough to trust.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>With Explain Data, the statistical figures that surfaced may or may not be interesting, and for the creator of data products, that information felt repetitive. For dashboard consumers, it felt like Explain Data would, similarly to Ask Data, introduce facts (albeit statistically and factually accurate) that might or might not be of significance. Both do push the bar of self-service analytics more toward the end user. However, they also invited an erosion of trust (with their audiences) that data professionals had been building up through highly developed and iterated dashboards.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>From the end of 2019 onward was what I call the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Salesforce" data-type="indexterm" id="id236"/><em>Salesforce era</em>—maybe as a nod to Taylor Swift, but more as an explanation of everything that has been the focus of Tableau since its acquisition by its parent company, Salesforce, in the second half of 2019. Since then, Salesforce and Tableau have turned their focus almost exclusively to the inclusion and integration of Salesforce and Tableau technologies and products. On the data analysis side, it meant the inclusion of Salesforce’s <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Einstein" data-type="indexterm" id="id237"/>Einstein, a mostly predictive and scoring analytics technology, allowing for more advanced analysis in both Tableau Desktop and Prep Builder. Improvements were also made in connecting to Salesforce data sources and embedding Tableau visualizations in its <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="customer relationship management (CRM)" data-type="indexterm" id="id238"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="CRM (customer relationship management)" data-type="indexterm" id="id239"/>customer relationship management (CRM) application. And finally, analytics expanded beyond CRM and Tableau Server/Cloud and into Slack, the communications platform Salesforce acquired in December of 2020. The Einstein integration and outbound communication<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Slack" data-type="indexterm" id="id240"/> to Slack were <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Data Stories" data-type="indexterm" id="id241"/>released in 2021. Data Stories (summarized text insights based on charts) released in 2022. <a data-type="xref" href="#pr01_figure_1_1732595610174675">Figure P-1</a> shows a timeline of these innovations.</p>&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure P-1. </span>Timeline of major Tableau innovations</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Looking back on this history lesson, it’s easy to see that Tableau has always positioned itself at the forefront of innovation in its mission of “helping people to see and understand data.” Tableau has not only expanded what it means to have access to data and user-friendly tools, but also introduced more features to lower the bar of entry into a data-informed <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau" data-secondary="history of" data-startref="kab001" data-type="indexterm" id="id242"/>workplace.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Introducing Tableau Pulse and Tableau Agent" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="pr01_introducing_tableau_pulse_and_tableau_agent_1732595610180633">&#13;
<h1>Introducing Tableau Pulse and Tableau Agent</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>And now we have reached the current time and the release of technologies that are at the heart of this book: Tableau Pulse and Tableau Agent (formerly Einstein Copilot).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Tableau Pulse" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="pr01_tableau_pulse_1732595610180698">&#13;
<h2>Tableau Pulse</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Tableau Pulse</em> <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="overview of" data-type="indexterm" id="id243"/>is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Pulse" data-see="Tableau Pulse" data-type="indexterm" id="id244"/>a completely new interface to and component in the Tableau product line. As of this writing, Pulse exists only within <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Cloud" data-type="indexterm" id="id245"/>Tableau Cloud, Tableau’s software as a service (SaaS) offering. Within this interface, important business measurements<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="KPIs (key performance indicators)" data-type="indexterm" id="id246"/> called <em>key performance indicators</em> (KPIs) can be constructed and are served up in a separate area for end users to <em>follow</em>, much like following someone on a social media platform. Pulse includes a Metrics layer where data professionals curate different measurements and give definition to them. Metrics are served up as simple and uniform charts along with AI-generated summaries, called <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="insights" data-secondary="summaries of" data-type="indexterm" id="id247"/>insight summaries. End users can subscribe to receive email or <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Slack" data-type="indexterm" id="id248"/>Slack communications including these summaries at a given frequency. They can also access their followed metrics within the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Mobile app" data-type="indexterm" id="id249"/>Tableau Mobile app, a pared-down version of Tableau Server/Cloud available on mobile devices, or in a browser. In this web experience, they can access simple filters and ask questions in a conversant manner, expanding their ability to interact with the KPIs.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_getting_started_with_tableau_pulse_1732595607647464">Chapter 2</a> introduces Pulse in more detail, including how to get started and work with it. You’ll also see hands-on examples based on industry use cases in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05_use_cases_with_tableau_pulse_1732595608896811">Chapter 5</a>.</p>&#13;

<h2>Tableau Agent</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Tableau Agent</em> <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Agent " data-secondary="overview of" data-type="indexterm" id="id250"/>is an <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-seealso="Tableau Agent" data-type="indexterm" id="id251"/>AI assistant located directly within the Tableau Cloud products. Its purpose is to help the data professional analyze data and build charts more quickly. Tableau Agent accomplishes this speed enhancement by jumpstarting the user with key questions they may want to ask of their data. It also provides chart creation and calculation support. In theory (and practice), Tableau Agent can help get you up to speed more quickly with a data set and create charts through conversation. All of this aims to take the iterative and feedback-driven nature of the Tableau platform and make it even faster for the data worker to find, process, and share impactful information.</p>&#13;
