   <p>In previous chapters, you dealt with numerical data and learned the basic analytical methods for translating a bunch of numbers into sound business advice. This chapter and the next will show you how to deal with something far more sinister than numbers—text. Most of the text you’ll encounter won’t be clean, literary language that an author has double-checked and had edited by specialists. More often, you will deal with hastily prepared notes, offhand reviews, and emails. Such data is riddled with errors that can significantly impact the quality of analysis and results. These include spelling mistakes, typographical and punctuation errors, and irregular use of capitalization. Additionally, texts often contain irrelevant or redundant information such as headers, footers, or metadata, as well as linguistic noise from nonstandard abbreviations, slang, or jargon. Just when you think you are prepared to handle all this by adapting your text-cleaning functions, you may encounter another exception, like a piece of . . . ASCII art!</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p7"> &#13;
   <p>To make things worse, most text analysis is done on an amount of text exceeding the average person’s capacity for bedtime stories, especially since a lot of text you’ll work with is the stuff of nightmares. Fortunately, people who were likely fond of different types of literature developed many methods enabling them to draw conclusions from large amounts of text without reading it all. We’ll discuss some of these techniques in this and next chapter. And thanks to generative AI, they are readily available to you.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p8"> &#13;
   <p>In particular, chapters 5 and 6 will guide you through the complexities of unstructured textual data to extract valuable insights, patterns, and knowledge. By the end of this chapter, you will be equipped to harness generative AI for a broad range of foundational text-mining tasks, all while avoiding the typical pitfalls associated with large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations or ad hoc changed assumptions. As in previous chapters, you will learn how generative AI can aid you in information gathering, analytical planning, data interpretation, and coding, as well as enable you to perform quick, initial text analyses—either through direct interaction with the model or by leveraging its API. Moreover, you will learn about more of generative AI’s limitations, recognizing when they may provide unreliable results, and also about identifying key factors you’ll need to watch to ensure accurate results.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p9"> &#13;
   <p>In this chapter, we will perform an analysis of customer reviews. You will also see how the polyglot abilities of generative AIs are invaluable for handling data in foreign languages. Additionally, you will be impressed by the generative capabilities of LLMs to summarize findings in a format that is ready to be presented to your boss.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p11"> &#13;
   <p>Even with well over half of internet traffic being dedicated to certain types of videos and unwanted marketing communications, there is a lot of data movement left to analyze. And there is a chance some of it will end up on your computer, with the expectation that you’ll be able to draw some insights from the content. As we mentioned in the chapter’s introduction, a lot of this data might, in fact, be text. The ever-increasing volume of unstructured textual content from social media, websites, emails, company documents, and academic publications has elevated the role of text mining. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p12"> &#13;
   <p>Text mining employs the combined powers of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) to convert the deluge of unstructured text into organized data for more straightforward analysis and interpretation. NLP is crucial, as it allows systems to understand and manipulate human language, converting sentences into structured forms that a computer can understand. For instance, NLP techniques can break down text into components like phrases and sentences, identify parts of speech, and extract relationships and entities. This structured data is then more amenable to analysis. ML complements this by providing models that can learn from the structured data, identifying patterns or predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to look for something specific. This is particularly useful in sentiment analysis or topic modeling. Lastly, AI integrates these technologies to automate the entire process, enhancing the ability to make decisions or generate insights from large volumes of text data efficiently. AI systems can adapt to new patterns in text, refine their understanding over time, and handle a wide variety of text sources and formats, making the process of text mining more dynamic and context-aware.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p13"> &#13;
   <p>In its final form, text mining enables the discovery of underlying patterns, trends, and insights, offering valuable capabilities such as sentiment tracking, trend spotting, threat identification, and a deeper understanding of customer preferences.</p> &#13;

   <h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_59"><span class="num-string">5.1.1</span> Generative AI is a game changer</h3> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p15"> &#13;
   <p>Imagine you are assigned the task of understanding the trends in the latest technologies from technical articles (hopefully scraped for you beforehand) or of parsing customer feedback in product reviews. We already mentioned that actually reading all this data is an impractical feat, given its sheer volume and human life expectancy. In addition, while technical articles will allow you to build a coherent vision of the technological landscape, customer reviews are often contradictory—not just with multiple reviews contradicting each other but also with self-defeating prose within individual reviews!</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p16"> &#13;
   <p>Traditionally, pre-LLM text-mining techniques took a shortcut by not analyzing the entire text. Instead, they focused on extracting the most informative parts, such as the most frequent phrases, or they relied on predefined dictionaries to search for meaning. These methods are akin to statistical sampling, drawing conclusions about a whole population based on a limited sample. Similarly, identifying the most frequent terms or detecting certain keywords can hint at the overall message without the time-consuming task of fully reading the text.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p17"> &#13;
   <p>LLMs, however, have revolutionized this analytical landscape. They can process immense amounts of text (for instance, Gemini claims a million token context) and they do so word by word, sentence by sentence. More than just reading, LLMs can interpret text, connecting seemingly disparate pieces of data to provide a comprehensive overview without relying on the frequency-based shortcuts of old-school methods. While it is true that LLMs might still employ some form of data processing shortcuts—and perhaps not even their developers fully understand every intricacy of how LLMs process data—the outputs, as we will explore in the following sections, are impressive. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p18"> &#13;
   <p>However, no solution is without its limitations, and LLMs are no exception. Before we examine these limitations, let’s take a moment to consider an often-overlooked aspect: the human psychology, and particularly how one can feel intimidated by the impressive capabilities of generative AI. Understanding this human element is crucial not only for using these tools effectively but also for ensuring your mental well-being.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p19"> &#13;
   <h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_60"><span class="num-string">5.1.2</span> Beware of AI intimidation</h3> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p20"> &#13;
   <p>At first glance, seeking assistance from generative AI for traditional text-mining tasks might appear counterintuitive. Instead of merely using ChatGPT or Gemini as an advisor for rule-based sentiment analysis, you could submit a collection of texts to them, request a sentiment assessment, and often achieve results superior to constructing everything from scratch. Even a brief encounter with modern generative AI can reveal their astonishing capabilities in coding, data analysis, and extracting knowledge from data, potentially leaving you awestruck and questioning your professional relevance, if not identity. Given this context, the methods discussed in this chapter might seem analogous to retrofitting a chariot with racing car components to win a race when the optimal solution would be to simply drive the Formula 1 car itself. In the following sections, you will see that this attitude may be shortsighted.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p21"> &#13;
   <p>A few years ago, the advent of deep learning methods seemingly rendered many traditional ML models antiquated. Deep learning often delivered superior results and proved easier to implement for numerous tasks. A similar scenario can be observed today with generative AIs, except their performance may surpass traditional ML models and deep learning by orders of magnitude. The reason is straightforward: an average programmer has limited resources, and training models with 100 trillion parameters is beyond their capabilities. This raises a pertinent question: why invest time in learning NLP basics or training your own language models? Instead, shouldn’t we focus solely on refining our communication skills with generative AIs while enjoying a cup of coffee?</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text print-book-callout" id="p22"> &#13;
   <p><span class="print-book-callout-head">Note</span>  If you want to learn more about how generative AIs are surpassing traditional ML models and deep learning, or want to find the means to stay competitive on the global AI market, I recommend reading “Choose Your Weapon: Survival Strategies for Depressed AI Academics,” an article by J. Togelius and G.N. Yannakakis (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06035">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06035</a>).</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p23"> &#13;
   <p>This way of thinking is typical of AI intimidation and can be fatal; these models actually have many limitations that mean it is vital to maintain your own skills, if only to ensure that you are not accepting AI’s outputs purely on faith. Also note that, so far, no good metric to assess the quality of these outputs has been proposed, which means humans will have to rely on their own reason and expertise for a while longer. Keeping your own brain cells in shape is also crucial if you opt to refine your generative AI conversational counterparts by training them on specific datasets of your choice (refer to chapter 1 for details). This approach offers a balanced middle ground between grasping every nuance of the technology behind generative AI and placing unwavering trust in its outputs.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p25"> &#13;
   <p>Using generative AI for text-mining tasks might seem appealing due to its broad language capabilities; however, in practical business applications, dedicated libraries may sometimes prove more effective. It should be stressed, though, that the area where traditional methods surpass generative AI is shrinking with almost every update. Nevertheless, let’s explore the scenarios in which generative AI may struggle:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p26"> <em>Accuracy</em><em> </em>—Tools like Spacy, NLTK, and TextBlob provide a level of accuracy in text analysis that generative AI might not achieve, especially with specialized vocabularies. For instance, a company conducting competitive analysis can use these libraries to accurately track competitor announcements, capturing mentions of new product features or strategies that generative AI might overlook due to its broader focus. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p27"> <em>Ambiguity</em><em> </em>—While generative AI can offer a wide contextual understanding, it may struggle with ambiguous language, such as words with multiple meanings or slang. A social media platform, for example, might use dedicated libraries fine-tuned for hate speech detection, which can more accurately identify harmful content by recognizing specific linguistic patterns and expressions that generative AI could miss or has not yet learned. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p28"> <em>Language proficiency</em><em> </em>—For text analysis in less common languages, dedicated libraries may be more effective than generative AI. However, with the latest updates, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a niche language that generative AI cannot handle. Even less commonly spoken languages like Welsh or Basque seem to be well supported. Nevertheless, if you ever need to analyze customer reviews in Tolkien’s Sindarin or Star Trek’s Klingon, you might find it more practical to use specialized language models. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p29"> <em>Consistency</em><em> </em>—Dedicated libraries offer consistent results, crucial for applications like content moderation on social media platforms. Unlike generative AI, which may vary in its interpretations, dedicated libraries apply the same rules and patterns for detection, ensuring equitable treatment across all content. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p30"> <em>Speed and scalability</em><em> </em>—In handling large datasets, dedicated libraries outperform generative AI in terms of speed and scalability, processing text data more efficiently. A news aggregation platform, for instance, can categorize thousands of articles quickly using NLTK or Spacy, enabling faster updates and insights. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p31"> <em>Customizability</em><em> </em>—The flexibility of dedicated libraries allows for tailoring to specific needs, such as a legal firm customizing search algorithms to navigate patent databases with precision—a level of customization generative AI cannot easily match, unless you download and fine-tune it yourself. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p32"> <em>Integration</em><em> </em>—Dedicated libraries integrate smoothly into existing systems and workflows, enhancing the efficiency of data processing and analysis. For example, a retail company can incorporate text-mining libraries into their analytics platforms for automatic sentiment analysis of customer feedback, informing marketing and product development. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p33"> &#13;
   <p>While these limitations suggest using generative AI for text mining with caution, it doesn’t imply that such LLMs should be omitted from your toolkit. By recognizing their strengths and weaknesses, generative AI can still play a significant role in your projects, offering valuable insights and enhancing the capabilities of more specialized tools. The key is to know when and how to effectively leverage each tool to fully realize its potential. With the knowledge gained from this chapter, you should be equipped to maximize the benefits of the generative AI of your choice.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p35"> &#13;
   <p>If you’ll ever work with marketing, product design, customer service, strategic planning, or . . . let’s keep it short. If you ever work with any customer-related business departments, there is a high probability they will task you with analyzing what customers think about their company product or service. Sometimes, companies decide to invest in customer surveys, but more often they decide to get insight from opinions available on their website or retail platform.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p36"> &#13;
   <p>The basics of analyzing scores associated with product reviews are to be found in previous chapters. Here, as the chapter’s title suggests, we’ll focus on analyzing the actual comments left by users.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p37"> &#13;
   <h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_63"><span class="num-string">5.2.1</span> Data quality</h3> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p38"> &#13;
   <p>Data cleaning has been addressed in previous chapters, but not all the elements of data preparation we previously discussed are applicable to text data. However, this does not mean it can be overlooked. It’s crucial to ensure you comprehend aspects such as the relevance, timeliness, uniqueness, and integrity of your data.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p39"> &#13;
   <p>Are these reviews even about your product, or did the agency scraping online retail websites send you reviews of your competitor’s products? Did you get recent reviews or data your predecessor analyzed three years ago? Are the comments unique, or will you assign “Karen’s from NY” complaint 60 times more weight than anybody else’s opinion because a glitch in the system copied her comment every second for a full minute? Finally, are the reviews bound to an order, or are they general impressions left on a review site? </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p40"> &#13;
   <p>If you don’t answer these questions, you may chase the wrong rabbit. Take your time. Look at the data. The following list of practices will ensure you have high-quality data in your analysis:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p41"> <em>Text cleaning</em><em> </em>—Start by removing irrelevant characters, such as HTML tags, emojis (unless they are part of your analysis), stopwords (i.e., common words like “and,” “the,” or “a,” that do not provide much information), and extra white space. Normalization techniques such as lowercasing can also help reduce complexity. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p42"> <em>Handling missing values</em><em> </em>—Decide on a strategy for missing data—whether to impute, ignore, or remove missing values. The choice might depend on the volume of missing data and its potential impact on the analysis. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p43"> <em>Dealing with duplicates</em><em> </em>—Identify and remove duplicate reviews, as they can skew your analysis. Sometimes, duplicates are not exact matches but paraphrases or slightly altered texts, which might require more sophisticated detection methods. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p44"> <em>Spell checking and correction</em><em> </em>—Reviews often contain spelling errors. Utilizing spell-check libraries can help correct these, but be cautious with domain-specific terms or slang. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p45"> <em>Language detection</em><em> </em>—Ensure your text data is in the expected language (or languages). Non-relevant language data can be filtered out, especially in global platforms where multiple languages are common. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p46"> <em>Sentiment consistency</em><em> </em>—For sentiment analysis, it’s useful to check for consistency between the review rating and the sentiment expressed in the text. Anomalies might indicate sarcasm or incorrect ratings. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p47"> <em>Entity recognition</em><em> </em>—Identifying and standardizing entities mentioned in text data (e.g., product names, brands) can improve the accuracy of your analysis, especially when aggregating insights. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p48"> <em>Removing or identifying biased data</em><em> </em>—Reviews may contain biased or non-representative views, especially if they are predominantly from a specific user group. Identifying and mitigating this bias is crucial for generalizable insights. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p49"> <em>Data anonymization</em><em> </em>—Ensure compliance with privacy laws by anonymizing personal information in your dataset. In the case of data that we use as an example, the anonymization replaced actual names with fictional ones. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p50"> <em>Use of domain-specific stopwords</em><em> </em>—Besides standard stopwords, consider removing or adding irrelevant or overly common words to your specific dataset of stopwords. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p51"> <em>Quality control pipelines</em><em> </em>—Implement automated pipelines that continuously monitor data quality metrics and flag issues for review. This is particularly important for real-time data analysis systems. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p52"> <em>Human-in-the-loop</em><em> </em>—Despite automation, having domain experts review and validate data quality and analysis outcomes periodically can catch nuances that automated systems miss. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p53"> &#13;
   <p>These practices are time-consuming and require a blend of automated tools and human judgment, and their specifics can vary depending on the nature of the text data and the objectives of the analysis. However, implementing these practices not only ensures data quality but also enriches your analysis, leading to more accurate and actionable insights.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p55"> &#13;
   <p>A common task in customer review is identifying the main areas of customer feedback: both positive aspects, and areas requiring improvement to boost customer satisfaction. The review dataset we are going to use throughout this chapter, collected from post-purchase customer surveys, resembles typical datasets of this kind: disorganized, emotional, and likely containing spelling errors. Analyzing this dataset will show you the practical applications of generative AI in text mining, underscoring their potential to transform how we analyze and interpret vast amounts of textual data.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p56"> &#13;
   <p>Throughout this and the next chapter, we will use the olist_order_reviews_dataset .csv file from the Brazilian e-commerce dataset. Both the file and the dataset were presented in previous chapters. As you can probably guess, the reviews are not in English, and unless you are familiar with Portuguese, the entire exercise may appear needlessly complex. However, this intricacy is purposeful, designed to demonstrate that generative AI can transform what was previously considered an insurmountable language barrier into a mere curb. Although it will still require a bit of your attention, crossing it will not make you sweat.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p57"> &#13;
   <p>As a reminder, the dataset file we will explore contains customers’ reviews of products and their buying experiences. It consists of seven columns:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p58"> <code>review_id</code>—Unique review identifier, an alphanumeric string </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p59"> <code>order_id</code>—Unique order identifier, an alphanumeric string </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p60"> <code>review_score</code>—Rating ranging from 1 to 5 given by the customer on a satisfaction survey </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p61"> <code>review_comment_title</code>—Comment title from the review left by the customer, in Portuguese </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p62"> <code>review_comment_message</code>—Comment message from the review left by the customer, in Portuguese </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p63"> <code>review_creation_date</code>—The date on which the satisfaction survey was sent to the customer in the format “YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss” </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p64"> <code>review_answer_timestamp</code>—The satisfaction survey answer timestamp in the format “YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss” </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p65"> &#13;
   <p>The easiest way to use this data is to save the input file in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook you downloaded from our GitHub repository (otherwise, you will have to specify the path to your file manually). If you want generative AI to generate a piece of code that acknowledges your specific input file, you’ll have to specify the filename in the query. If you don’t specify the input file directly, generative AI will probably refer to the input as your_data.csv or something similar. In such a case, you must manually replace this made-up filename with the path to your input file. The loaded input file will be stored as a pandas DataFrame under the variable <code>df</code>.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p66"> &#13;
   <p>To demonstrate the utility of generative AI in analyzing the provided reviews, we will initially focus on fundamental techniques for extracting information from text, such as a frequency analysis of common words and expressions (section 5.3). After that, we will explore co-occurrence analysis to examine patterns of word associations (section 5.4). These two sections should offer insights into the most prevalent topics covered within the reviews. Our next step will involve the basic categorization of reviews as positive, negative, or neutral by analyzing the occurrence of sentiment-related keywords (section 5.5) and lexicon phrases (section 5.6). More sophisticated text-mining techniques are presented and compared in chapter 6. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p67"> &#13;
   <p>To evaluate the efficacy of the tested sentiment analysis methods, we will utilize the <code>review_score</code> field, which conveys customer satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 5. This numerical score allows easy determination of negative, positive, or neutral reviews without any textual analysis. However, you must keep in mind that in real-life scenarios, analyzed texts, especially of a different nature than reviews, are rarely accompanied by such scores; we are employing them here strictly for research purposes.</p> &#13;

   <h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_65"><span class="num-string">5.3</span> Frequency analysis</h2> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p69"> &#13;
   <p>Diving into frequency analysis is far from a ceremonial nod to data analytics’ past—it’s a smart strategy that fills your toolbox with useful, real-world applications. Besides its well-known importance in cryptography and security, frequency analysis also plays a big role in studying more exotic DNA and protein analysis terrains. For example, it helps find patterns or sequences that are key for understanding genetic diseases or developing groundbreaking drugs. Looking at more everyday uses, frequency analysis in e-commerce helps spot trends in customers’ buying, showing which products are hot and predicting future sales. In social media, it helps identify what topics or hashtags are getting attention, helping brands connect better with people. And in customer service, analyzing the most common complaints or questions can make everything run smoother and keep customers happier.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p70"> &#13;
   <p>Frequency analysis offers a clear and direct path to uncovering insights, but what exactly is it? Simply put, frequency analysis tallies how frequently each item occurs within a dataset. When applied to text analysis, it enables us to measure how often certain words or phrases appear, providing a clear view of the primary topics or ideas being discussed.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p71"> &#13;
   <p>To demonstrate how frequency analysis can help in everyday business situations, we will focus on analyzing customer reviews from the collection presented in the previous section. To learn what customers most often praise or complain about, our initial instinct might be to read a few randomly selected reviews. However, this approach may not be effective, especially if the reviews are in a foreign language, and the chosen sample may not represent the overall content. Examining frequently occurring words and phrases is a much more efficient method of grasping the overall sentiment of customer feedback.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p72"> &#13;
   <p>The best way to utilize generative AI in frequency analysis is by letting it guide you through the process, offering suggestions on tools and techniques, and providing code examples in popular programming languages. </p> &#13;

   <p>While a quick check of your product’s average rating (the number of stars) will provide an overall customer satisfaction level, frequency analysis of customer reviews offers a comprehensive view into the nuances of consumer sentiment, revealing what customers value and the areas requiring attention. By pinpointing the most frequently mentioned aspects of a product or service, such as “customer service” or “durability,” businesses can understand the key drivers of customer satisfaction. Positive examples, like repeated praise for a smartphone’s “battery life,” highlight the product features that resonate well with consumers, indicating areas of strength.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p75"> &#13;
   <p>Conversely, the balance between positive and negative terms in reviews provides insight into the product’s overall reception. A higher frequency of positive terms suggests customer satisfaction, while prevalent negative terms might pinpoint issues needing resolution. This balance offers a clear gauge of how well a product meets customer expectations.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p76"> &#13;
   <p>Moreover, frequency analysis can detect shifts in customer preferences and emerging trends. An increase in mentions of “eco-friendly” features could signal a growing demand for sustainable products, guiding businesses to adjust their offerings accordingly. It also reveals common use cases, such as the popularity of “low light performance” for cameras, indicating how customers commonly use the product.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p77"> &#13;
   <p>By integrating these insights, frequency analysis serves as a powerful tool for businesses to understand both the current landscape of customer appreciation and the evolving trends in consumer preferences. This can enable a strategic approach to product development and marketing, ensuring that offerings not only meet current customer needs but are also positioned to adapt to future demands, leading to enhanced customer satisfaction and business success.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p79"> &#13;
   <p>The most straightforward and intuitive method for conducting frequency analysis using generative AI is to directly input the data into the chat interface and request the desired analysis. Upon testing, all GenAI models demonstrated consistent performance, producing similar results. Should there be any gaps or inaccuracies in the initial output, a follow-up query from the user can swiftly refine and enhance the accuracy of the response. Let’s look in detail at how ChatGPT handles this task.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text prompt" id="p80"> &#13;
   <p><strong class="prompt-head-image"><img alt="image" height="67px" src="../Images/Init-MA.png" width="66px"/></strong><strong><span class="aframe-location"/></strong>Can you perform basic frequency analysis on this bunch of reviews:</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p83"> &#13;
   <p><strong class="response-head-image"><img alt="image" height="60px" src="../Images/Response.png" width="59px"/></strong><strong><span class="aframe-location"/></strong>The frequency analysis of the provided reviews reveals a focus on a few key terms:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p84"> &#13;
   <p>“a” and “e” appear most frequently, but as they are articles and conjunctions in Portuguese, their high frequency is expected and not particularly informative.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p85"> &#13;
   <p>“do” (of/from) and “o” (the) also show up frequently, again reflecting common Portuguese grammar structures rather than specific content.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p86"> &#13;
   <p>More relevant to the reviews’ content, “antes” (before), “prazo” (deadline), and “aparelho” (device) each appear multiple times, indicating common themes around timely delivery and product discussions.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p87"> &#13;
   <p>“prazo” appearing 3 times underscores a focus on delivery times in these reviews.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p88"> &#13;
   <p>“aparelho” appearing 3 times suggests that the product, presumably some type of device, is a central topic of discussion.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p89"> &#13;
   <p>The words “recebi” (I received), “parabéns” (congratulations), “pela” (by the/for the), “marca” (brand), “esta” (this/is), “com” (with), “que” (that/which), “produto” (product), “entrega” (delivery), “compra” (purchase), and “foi” (was) appearing twice each further highlight common elements of customer feedback, such as receiving products, brand mentions, and satisfaction with purchases and deliveries.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p90"> &#13;
   <p>This analysis indicates a general satisfaction with delivery times and product quality, with some mentions of brand and product discrepancies.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p91"> &#13;
   <p>In the preceding example, the model’s response was enriched with a Python code snippet used to perform the analysis. Interestingly, generative AI can also perform such analyses using its built-in language model capabilities, presenting an alternative method that doesn’t require external coding. It’s vital, however, to recognize the distinction between these two methodologies and to be conscious of which one your generative AI employs to deliver its insights. For example, ChatGPT, as of February 2024, shows a preference for a method that involves crafting and running Python code, followed by an interpretation of the outcomes. This preference underscores the method’s reliability and the tangible benefit of having a verifiable code snippet to review the analysis’s accuracy.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p92"> &#13;
   <p>Nevertheless, invoking generative AI’s inherent language abilities through a specific prompt remains a viable option (e.g., by requesting “use your inherent abilities for this task”). This approach, while immediately accessible and not requiring any coding knowledge, tends to be more error-prone and less scalable due to token analysis limitations. Moreover, it functions as a black-box mechanism, where the underlying process isn’t as transparent, and users don’t receive a code snippet to verify the analysis’s logic.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p93"> &#13;
   <p>Speaking of token number limitations, we pasted just the first ten reviews from the example data set into the previous dialogue. For an effective and manageable analysis within this format, it’s best to keep the input text to a moderate length—ideally, a few paragraphs or around 500 words. You should be aware that while there isn’t a strict limit on how much text you can paste for fast frequency analysis, excessively long texts may cause processing delays or exceed the context token limit for a single response. If your input or the AI-generated response exceeds this limit, the message may be truncated, and you may not receive the full information you require. In such cases, it’s advisable to divide your input or request into smaller portions and send them separately to ensure you receive complete and accurate responses. The input/output limits of generative AI were discussed in chapter 1.</p> &#13;

   <h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_68"><span class="num-string">5.3.3</span> Uploading a data file to ChatGPT for frequency analysis</h3> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p95"> &#13;
   <p>For handling larger inputs, a more practical option to consider is directly uploading your data file to generative AI and requesting the specific analysis you need. However, not all generative AI platforms offer this feature, so it’s important to verify its availability.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p96"> &#13;
   <p>When uploading data files, keeping the file size manageable, ideally below a few megabytes, is crucial for efficient processing. ChatGPT supports various formats, such as plain text (.txt), CSV (.csv), and Excel (.xlsx), making analysis more straightforward. While there is no strict limit on data size, very large datasets may necessitate focusing on particular segments to manage the analysis effectively within the platform’s processing capabilities. Moreover, it’s vital to ensure that the data does not contain sensitive or personally identifiable information to adhere to privacy regulations and company policies.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p97"> &#13;
   <p>Furthermore, when uploading data files to a generative AI platform for analysis, several issues might arise that could affect the accuracy and reliability of the results. Issues with data cleanliness and formatting can lead to misinterpretations; incorrectly preprocessed data may result in skewed or erroneous analyses. Without a deep understanding of the dataset’s context and subtleties, the model may miss important insights or make inaccurate assumptions, particularly with complex or specialized data.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p98"> &#13;
   <p>Therefore, for complex and nuanced datasets, it’s recommended that you maintain oversight throughout the analysis process. This involves breaking the analysis into manageable parts and using generative AI for assistance at each stage, while keeping a close watch on the progress. Although generative AI can help in deriving conclusions, relying entirely on it for a comprehensive large-scale data analysis project is asking for trouble. It’s important to understand that the issue isn’t just about the input size generative AI can handle, because with nearly every update, the capacity of LLMs increases. Employing a “divide and conquer” strategy is beneficial because it allows you to supervise the process, understand what is happening, and identify errors.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p100"> &#13;
   <p>Throughout this chapter, we emphasize the fact that in real-life scenarios, most of the text input data you’ll encounter will likely be neither small nor simple, unlike the examples provided earlier. In such situations, your strategy should include soliciting generative AI for a tailored code snippet to address your data analysis needs. To secure a snippet that’s ready for use, you might need to specify the name of your DataFrame, the specific column where your data resides, or both. Generative AI may default to a generic naming convention if you don’t.°</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p101"> &#13;
   <p>Since the models won’t directly interact with your data this time, it is prudent to supply essential additional details about your dataset; in this example, highlighting that your data is in Portuguese could be crucial. Advanced frequency analysis requires the elimination of stopwords and the tokenization of text, which are inherently language-dependent tasks. You will need to employ an appropriate set of Portuguese stopwords and a tokenizer that is designed for the Portuguese language. The GenAI model is expected to adjust to these specifications accordingly, but as you will discover, this process may not always function flawlessly. Consider the following prompt.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text prompt" id="p102"> &#13;

   <p>We have included the recording of the whole conversation to show you that even though we specifically informed ChatGPT that we would be working with reviews in Portuguese, it doesn’t take that fully into account. The proposed tokenizer uses its default settings and applies tokenization rules for English. In practice, this small oversight should not generate serious differences in the output, but it is a very important lesson for us.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text print-book-callout" id="p109"> &#13;
   <p><span class="print-book-callout-head">Generative AIs forget about the context</span>  In some cases, generative AI may disregard crucial aspects of NLP analysis, such as the language of the input data. Consequently, certain portions of the code may use tools with default settings (usually for English), while others may leverage language-specific libraries. To ensure accuracy, always thoroughly review the recommended resources and their settings, ensuring they align with your analysis’s context.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p110"> &#13;
   <p>You may wonder if talking to generative AIs in Portuguese would eliminate such errors. Remember that these AIs generate their answers based on the selected online resources it was trained on, and in the case of NLP, most of these resources are in English. The most popular generative AI will naturally drift toward English data solutions anytime you let them out of your sight. Even if communication in Portuguese may reduce the number of similar issues, there is no guarantee that you will be able to eliminate them completely. Stay alert!</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p111"> &#13;
   <p>Another question is whether other generative AIs perform better in this task. We posed the same query to Gemini and Code Llama, receiving varied responses. For instance, Gemini accurately recognized the need for Portuguese language support in its code, making it immediately usable. However, its analysis was rather basic, relying on Python’s <code>split</code> method for tokenization without employing a specialized tokenizer, and it failed to address stopword removal. Yet, Gemini did account for some text cleaning specific to the Portuguese language and encouraged users to refine their queries for enhanced results. Conversely, the code from Code Llama wasn’t immediately functional, requiring several manual adjustments even to run. Its proposed analysis lacked depth, with no cleaning, tokenization, or stopword removal, making it challenging to assess Code Llama’s ability to recognize the intended language of the input data.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p112"> &#13;
   <p>If an error occurs, as in the preceding scenario, where the context of our analysis was overlooked, you can request a correction. Advanced generative AI, with ChatGPT as a frontrunner, can help you even if you don’t provide it with a very detailed problem description; even a slight hint can steer the generative AI toward an improved solution. This feature proves invaluable when you feel something is amiss with the answer but can’t identify the specifics.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p119"> &#13;
   <p>It may be beneficial to approach every answer the model returns with skepticism and questioning. Beware, however, of voicing all of your concerns.

Just dropping “Are you sure about it?” after each prompt can take you down the rabbit hole. However, a question about a given aspect of the analysis should result in either a correction or an explanation of the selected method. With a healthy dose of skepticism, you will probably discover additional errors the model can correct without guidance. </p> &#13;

    <p>Feel free to question the responses of generative AI whenever you have doubts about the output. The better you understand its errors, and the more accurately you can describe them in your next prompt, the more satisfying the final answer will be. Even if you cannot pinpoint the exact error, the AI might still manage to correct itself. However, there is a genuine risk of generative AI acknowledging mistakes it hasn’t actually made! When challenged, it might opt to deliver incorrect responses instead of contradicting the user.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p122"> &#13;
   <p>The aim of this brief exercise is not to compare the capabilities of various generative AIs or to demonstrate how you can obtain a perfect code snippet with a single prompt. All the models mentioned are adept at handling such tasks, and with a little effort and attention to detail, you can extract the necessary information from them. Moreover, engineering of the prompts that elicit perfect responses is not an exact science. Interacting with generative AIs is a dynamic dialogue where you can progressively refine your queries based on the feedback you receive.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p123"> &#13;
   <p>The key lesson from this exercise is the importance of vigilance in evaluating the output for accuracy and relevance. To do this effectively, you should understand the fundamentals of the techniques you’re employing. In our scenario, a thorough frequency analysis necessitates the removal of stopwords and proper tokenization with respect to the language of the input data. The good news is that if you’re unfamiliar with a method, you can always begin by asking generative AI about the basics of the technique.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p126"> &#13;
   <p>Once, a boss asked his employee to describe, “in one word,” how they felt at work. The reply was “good.” Feeling encouraged, the boss then asked for an answer “in two words,” to which the response was “not good.” While this joke may not be the height of humor, it illustrates a valid point: single, common words often fail to capture the essence of messages in our reviews. A more effective strategy involves focusing on groups of consecutive words, which offer a clearer view of customer sentiment by capturing the context and nuances that single words might miss. These sequences of <em>n</em> items, such as words, are referred to as <em>n</em>-grams in NLP.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p127"> &#13;
   <p>To extract the most common phrases from customer reviews, you can analyze the frequency of <em>n</em>-grams, most commonly bigrams (where <em>n</em>=2) and trigrams (where <em>n</em>=3). Higher-order <em>n</em>-grams may also be useful, depending on the level of granularity required for your analysis, especially when the text data you are analyzing is more complex. By analyzing the frequency, you can identify trends, common concerns, or strengths in their products or services, allowing the business to address issues more effectively. For example, the mere recurrence of the word “delivery” does not provide much insight into customer satisfaction. However, noticing the frequent appearance of phrases like “failed delivery” or “super fast delivery” in reviews can lead to valuable and actionable insights. A quick request to generative AI can result in a code snippet that will analyze trigrams in our reviews. In the following example, we used the same ChatGPT session and the following prompt: “Propose code snippet to analyze trigrams in my reviews.”</p> &#13;

The good news is that generative AIs can easily do that for you. As a bonus, you don’t need to extract the words from the output lists or tuples before translation. You can simply copy and paste the raw output, and a sufficiently advanced generative AI should be able to process it. In our case, we got the following result:</p> &#13;

   </div> &#13;
   <div class="readable-text" id="p158"> &#13;
    <p>Generative AI proves useful for small-scale text-mining operations. Many NLP tasks, such as frequency analysis, can be executed utilizing its intrinsic language model. However, for larger inputs and more functional applications, it’s preferable to leverage models to generate a dedicated script. The most convenient way to do so is to upload your data file and specify the desired analysis in the prompt, but not all GenAIs have this option. </p> &#13;
   </div> &#13;
   <div class="readable-text" id="p159"> &#13;
    <p>In both cases—utilizing GenAI's intrinsic language model and asking it for dedicated scripts—it is crucial to stay alert to potential errors and the misinterpretation of data. </p> &#13;
   </div> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p160"> &#13;
   <p>You have just observed how leveraging generative AIs for frequency analysis can swiftly and efficiently yield valuable and actionable insights. In the following section, we’ll explore whether this analysis can be enhanced using a slightly more advanced technique: co-occurrence analysis.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p161"> &#13;
   <h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_72"><span class="num-string">5.4</span> Co-occurrence analysis</h2> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p162"> &#13;
   <p>Speaking of reviews, consider the feedback on how a software update affects device performance. Let’s assume your product development team has outdone itself, and your website is flooded with comments from users concerned specifically about how the new software version “slows down” the device “over time.” While trigram analysis might identify phrases like “software update slows,” “update slows down,” or “slows down device,” it could overlook the broader, nuanced issue of performance degradation “over time” after the update. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p163"> &#13;
   <p>Is hope lost? Not really, unless it’s the hope, after the previous section, that your text analysis is done and dusted. There is still a lot to do! </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p164"> &#13;
   <p>The method that would identify the relationships between “software update,” “slows down,” and “over time,” even when these terms aren’t part of the same trigram, is called co-occurrence analysis. To examine relationships between specific terms like these, we must first clean and tokenize our text data. Next, we need to choose a context window, which dictates how many words around a target word are considered to establish relationships. For each word, we then count how often other words appear within this window and record these counts in a co-occurrence matrix. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p165"> &#13;
   <p>This matrix helps identify which terms frequently appear near each other, providing insights into common themes and issues discussed across the dataset, such as potential impacts of software updates on device performance over time—a key insight for developers and customer service. It’s a simple yet potent tool!</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p167"> &#13;
   <p>While co-occurrence analysis might seem similar to <em>n</em>-gram analysis at first glance, they tackle different aspects of text mining. Where the latter zooms in, searching for the words snugly fitting next to each other, co-occurrence analysis zooms out a bit, capturing word pairs in a broader context. This can reveal some surprising connections and insights that you wouldn’t get from just looking at immediate word sequences. For a more detailed comparison of these two methods, see table 5.1.</p> &#13;

For larger datasets, uploading a data file and requesting analysis will yield both the necessary code and a comprehensive analysis explanation.

However, the results, while accurate, might overlook some finer details of the data. For instance, in the preceding example, tokenization is based on the basic Python <code>split</code> method. If you find this approach insufficient for your analysis and want to explore more deeply, you might need to ask the model to revise the snippet using more advanced methods.

   <p>Another issue with the code proposed in listing 5.3 is that it may be inefficient, considering the size of the input dataset. In co-occurrence analysis, we need to create matrices where rows and columns represent unique words, with values indicating their frequency of co-occurrence. Since most word pairs rarely occur together, the resulting matrices are predominantly filled with zeros, necessitating the use of sparse matrices, which are data structures that store only nonzero elements. Using sparse matrices saves significant amounts of memory and computational resources. If you’re anxious about the execution time, don’t worry. Generative AI rarely returns optimal code as its first answer. We’ll cover issues related to code optimization in detail in chapter 7.</p> &#13;

Additionally, interesting pairs include “great-product,” “excellent-product,” and “super-recommend,” indicating customer satisfaction with product quality. The only indication of negative sentiment discernible in this figure is the co-occurrence of the words “not” and “received.” Furthermore, we can deduce that most reviews refer to the store or website codenamed “Lannister.”</p> &#13;

   <p>While working at a large corporation, we encountered an instance where customer reviews frequently touched upon various topics but notably avoided mentioning a specific feature that the engineering team had pegged as a major selling point, and that was heavily promoted by the marketing department. This scenario might resonate with your professional experiences. How often are you confronted with inquiries like, “But what do customers think about our prized Quantum Fluff feature?” More critically, what steps can you take if your analysis reveals that Quantum Fluff doesn’t even rank among the top 50 most mentioned features in frequency analysis?</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;

   <p>This is where keyword search is pivotal. By locating and extracting information from vast text datasets based on specific words or phrases, this fundamental text-mining technique proves invaluable. It aids in uncovering patterns, trends, and insights within unstructured textual data, serving as a cornerstone for tasks such as sentiment analysis and document classification.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p195"> &#13;
   <p>As NLP techniques continue to evolve, keyword search methods are becoming increasingly sophisticated, incorporating advanced text processing techniques like tokenization (the process of dividing text into individual words or terms), stemming (reducing words to their base or root form by removing inflections or suffixes), and lemmatization (converting words to their base form using linguistic knowledge) to enhance the precision and relevance of search results.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p196"> &#13;
   <p>You can integrate generative AI into a keyword search process by using the model to enhance various aspects of the search, such as generating relevant keywords, improving text preprocessing, generating code, or even providing summaries of the search results. We will demonstrate generative AI’s capabilities in the next section by completing the simple task of extracting customer reviews that contain a keyword indicating a positive opinion about products or services.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p198"> &#13;
   <p>Everyone would agree that Quantum Fluff is a pretty specific keyword to search for, and selecting all the reviews that contain it is relatively simple in a digital environment. But that’s not all there is to keyword search. In data analytics, keywords are used to distinguish between positive and negative feedback. You can identify positive reviews by searching for messages that include keywords often linked with positive opinions and vice versa. While a star-based score can give you an idea about the overall product performance, keywords can tell you how happy (or unhappy) your clients are with specific aspects of your offering. Performing this task at regular intervals can, for instance, assist in tracking the volume of positive feedback over time, which becomes especially valuable following any modifications to the product or service. For example, you could use it to filter out customer reviews that mention “durable,” “enduring,” or “lasting” from discussions about a product’s quality.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p199"> &#13;
   <p>Apart from performing customer feedback analysis, keyword search can be instrumental in a variety of business contexts. Imagine being able to tap into market trends by observing how often certain phrases pop up over time. For instance, if you notice an uptick in mentions of “sustainable packaging,” this could signal a shift in consumer preferences, guiding you to possibly rethink your product offerings or marketing approach.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p200"> &#13;
   <p>Then there’s the aspect of competitive intelligence. By keeping an eye on how frequently your competitors are mentioned across news articles and social media, you might uncover insights into their strategies or product launches, giving you a chance to adapt or innovate in response.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p201"> &#13;
   <p>Content optimization for SEO is another area where keyword search shines. By understanding the terms your target audience uses, you can optimize your website content to rank higher on search engine results, attracting more visitors.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p202"> &#13;
   <p>Risk management, too, benefits from keyword search. Monitoring mentions of your company alongside negative terms allows you to address potential issues proactively.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p203"> &#13;
   <p>Lastly, keyword search can unveil opportunities for innovation. By spotting discussions around unmet needs in your industry, you could lead your company to develop groundbreaking products that fill these gaps.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p204"> &#13;
   <p>In each of these scenarios, keyword search is your ally in navigating the competitive and ever-evolving business landscape, allowing you to make informed decisions that keep you ahead of the curve.</p> &#13;

   <p>Let’s go to a restaurant. Specifically, to a restaurant chain. One that specializes in deliveries. Let’s assume you’ve been tasked with identifying, on the basis of reviews, if there are problems with the timeliness of the food delivery service they offer. It’s a really big chain, and a popular one, which means you’ll have a lot of reviews on your hands. Reading all of them is out of the question. Give yourself a couple of minutes to come up with all the keywords relevant to your task. You should have things like “late delivery,” “long wait,” and “slow service” on your list. Did you add “cold food,” “soggy fries,” and “starving” as well?</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p207"> &#13;
   <p>Generating relevant keywords for a specific search task may be harder than you think. First, the issue of expertise comes into play. Without a deep understanding of the field, identifying the most effective keywords can feel like attempting to summon a demon without knowing its name. Eventually, some particularly nasty demon would appear, or you might stumble upon some keywords, but there’s no assurance they will be effective. The most deceptive part, probably even more deceptive than the nasty demon itself, is the illusion of completion these keywords might provide, leaving you unaware of how far your findings might be from the truth.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p208"> &#13;
   <p>Time constraints present another challenge. Since time is money and money is a key motivator for most businesses, it is rare that you will have the luxury to research emerging trends or niche terminology thoroughly without rushing. This is despite the adage that more haste results in less speed. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of language and market shifts means that yesterday’s optimal keywords may not capture today’s conversational nuances or consumer interests. Bias in generating keywords poses an additional hurdle. Much like the devil (or our accidentally summoned demon friend) hides in the details, a slight preference or even an unconscious assumption can narrow your keyword selection, potentially causing you to overlook broader or emerging topics of interest. Finally, similar to our review analysis, the text and keywords you may need to investigate could be in a foreign language, adding an extra layer of complexity to your task.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p209"> &#13;
   <p>Generative AI emerges as a beacon in this complex landscape. By leveraging its vast database and learning capabilities, generative AI can swiftly generate a diverse and relevant set of keywords, cutting through the noise to identify those that truly resonate with current trends and audience needs. This not only saves time but also brings a level of objectivity, insight, and adaptability to keyword generation, which manually combing through data simply can’t match. However, the world changes rapidly, and the generative AI of your choice may not be up to date with the latest trends if it was trained just a few months ago. Ultimately, it is your responsibility to steer the boat and avoid the rocks. If the light from your AI beacon seems too weak or unreliable, consider using other methods.</p> &#13;

   <p>Returning to our narrative from a large company, the development team is eager to learn not just about their pet feature but about others as well. Marketing acknowledges that their narrative hasn’t gained enough traction and is in search of fresh claims to emphasize. Logistics is desperate for feedback on delivery. You might describe this scenario as mayhem or the frontline, but in reality, it’s just another Monday morning, given that customer feedback is invaluable to everyone involved.

   <p>In our scenario, let’s imagine for a while that your boss has an innovative idea to integrate generative AI’s functionality into a more comprehensive software solution designed to automate review analysis. For instance, the new application should take as input a general query in the form “I want to extract reviews about…,” then use generative AI to generate a desired list of keywords, and then run the code to extract relevant reviews that contain these keywords. Fortunately for your boss, this idea is entirely feasible thanks to the APIs offered by some generative AIs. Unfortunately for you, your boss’s idea may not be as brilliant as he believes.

   <p>The preceding code generally works well, but there are some issues that need to be addressed. The first is the post-processing of the output. We should remember that consistency and repetition are not guaranteed. Even though the model returns the keyword list in the exact same format, in our example, this may not hold true for more complex tasks. In such cases, you either need to ensure the proper formatting of the output, which requires manual inspection, or you can fine-tune the prompt to encourage the model to present the response in the desired format. The difficulty of this task varies depending on the type of model used, but the latest versions tend to perform better in this regard.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p242"> &#13;
   <p>The second issue concerns the desired number of generated keywords. It might seem intuitive to set the <code>max_tokens</code> parameter to 20, but this will not work. The model requires more tokens to generate our list effectively. Experimenting with this parameter will reveal that setting it to anything less than 100, or even 120, results in an incomplete, truncated list with fewer keywords than desired. This is because the <code>max_tokens</code> parameter in the API call does not directly dictate the number of keywords to generate; instead, it specifies the maximum number of tokens (words or word pieces) that the model’s response can contain.

   <p>The last issue pertains to the keywords themselves. With each run, the list may look slightly different. Even if all proposed keywords are more or less suitable for your task, certain implementations of the code, such as unit tests, require identical output for the same input. Is it possible to force the model to generate an identical outcome with each run? By this time, everyone should be aware of the <code>temperature</code> parameter, which is intended to regulate the model’s creativity and imagination. Adjusting its value from 0 to 1 transforms dull Clark Kent into Superman. However, even setting the temperature to 0 does not guarantee completely consistent results. After all, it appears that even the most mundane androids still dream of electric sheep.</p> &#13;

   <p>At the outset of this section, we noted that generative AIs effectively generate keywords that reflect current trends. To evaluate how different models fare in this regard and to identify potential pitfalls, let’s briefly shift our focus from customer reviews and tackle the task of providing a list of hashtags for searching social media posts about the most trending movies. This experiment targets movies for two main reasons: their release dates and popularity are well-documented online, making verification straightforward, and most people are generally aware of current and past cinema trends, allowing us to discuss results without extensive prior research.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p248"> &#13;
   <p>Two models known for their quick and easy web browsing capabilities are Gemini and ChatGPT 4. For our task, we used the following prompt:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text prompt" id="p249"> &#13;
   <p><strong class="prompt-head-image"><img alt="image" height="67px" src="../Images/Init-MA.png" width="66px"/></strong><strong><span class="aframe-location"/></strong>Can you run a quick internet search to check the current 5 most popular movies and, based on the results, generate a list of hashtags to search social media posts that mention them?</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p250"> &#13;
   <p>The results from the two models were notably different, primarily because Gemini (as well as Gemini Advanced) and ChatGPT 4 referenced different lists of current trending movies. Consequently, ChatGPT 4’s list included: <em>This Is Me... Now: A Love Story</em>; <em>Lover, Stalker, Killer</em>; <em>Anyone But You</em>; <em>Double Blind</em>; and <em>The Crime Is Mine</em>. In contrast, Gemini’s suggestions were <em>Wicked</em>; <em>Madame Web</em>; <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverin</em><em>e</em>; and <em>Dune: Part Two</em>. As of February 2024, it’s clear that ChatGPT 4’s list appears somewhat dated, featuring three movies from 2023 and missing current blockbusters like <em>Poor Things</em> and <em>Dune: Part 2</em>. Further inquiry into the sources used by the models revealed that ChatGPT 4 relied on popular websites like IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. However, the model noted that this might not be the optimal choice for capturing the latest trends, as these sites are more suited to identifying popular movies over time. Upon deeper probing, ChatGPT 4 admitted to using a month-old IMDb editorial on popular movies to generate its list of trends. Conversely, Gemini synthesized information from IMDb’s “Most Popular Movies” chart, industry news, articles, streaming service charts, and social media trends, showcasing a more comprehensive and current approach.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p251"> &#13;
   <p>Drawing from this experiment and our overall experience while writing this book, we arrived at a conclusion that might be seen as subjective: Gemini excels in web searches compared to ChatGPT 4, and this stands even for its free version. Specifically, it synthesizes information from various sources, unlike ChatGPT, which often concentrates on the first available internet result.</p> &#13;

However, if you’re feeling less inclined to edit the code yourself, you can bring this issue to generative AI’s attention and likely receive an effective workaround, as presented in listing 5.6. We always recommend engaging in a more extended dialogue with generative AI, rather than aiming to craft a single perfect prompt. Through such interactions, generative AI can act more as a guiding assistant than a sole solution provider, often sparking inspiration and leading to new ideas for enhanced research.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p261"> &#13;
   <p>We already discussed that different generative AIs and even different runs of the same generative AI can provide different results. But how can you tell which generative AI generates <em>better </em>results for your purposes? Before we start enhancing our keyword search, it is essential to establish a practical measure to evaluate the quality of both current and future output. Extracting positive reviews essentially constitutes a classification task, and assessing the quality of such classifications is crucial for numerous business scenarios, not limited only to analyzing customer feedback.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p262"> &#13;
   <p>Consider, for instance, the task of email sorting and prioritization in customer service. Accurately classifying emails into complaints, inquiries, or requests can significantly enhance response efficiency and customer satisfaction. In the realm of fraud detection, the ability to precisely distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions is paramount for financial institutions to mitigate risks and protect customers. Similarly, for platforms hosting user-generated content, accurately identifying and filtering inappropriate content through content moderation is vital for maintaining a safe and compliant online environment. Each of these examples underscores the importance of reliable classification systems in streamlining operations, safeguarding interests, and ensuring a positive user experience across various business domains.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p263"> &#13;
   <p>To assess the quality of any binary classification, the simplest approach would be to calculate its sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is a measure of the proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified as positive by a classifier, while specificity is a measure of the proportion of actual negative cases that are correctly identified as negative by a classifier (see figure 5.3). A high sensitivity means that the classifier correctly identifies most of the positive cases, while a high specificity means that the classifier correctly identifies most of the negative cases. <span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p264">  &#13;
   <img alt="figure" src="../Images/CH05_F03_Siwiak3.png"/> &#13;
   <h5 class="figure-container-h5 sigil_not_in_toc"><span class="num-string">Figure 5.3</span> Sensitivity and specificity</h5>&#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p265"> &#13;
   <p>The combination of sensitivity and specificity gives an overall measure of the accuracy of the classifier, and in a perfect world, the classifier should have both measures equal to 1. In most practical cases, you should open your champagne if both sensitivity and specificity score above 0.9, but the exact threshold depends on the context of your analysis. A sensitivity of 0.9 for extracting positive reviews may be fine; the same sensitivity for cancer-screening tests means that 10% of ill people go home without a diagnosis that could save their lives.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p266"> &#13;
   <p>Thus, a crucial step of the protocol is to set your acceptable level of specificity and/or sensitivity while acknowledging the tradeoff between the two measures. Increasing sensitivity can decrease specificity and vice versa. A good example is a demon classifier (which could be the one we summoned earlier) whose only job is to label all records as positives. Such a model would have a sensitivity of 1. How perfect! All criminals will end up in jail if we put everyone behind bars, won’t they? That is why it is extremely important always to measure both the sensitivity and specificity of your model. You may come to the conclusion that a lower specificity is acceptable in your context, but it should always be an informed decision, not a coincidence.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p267"> &#13;
   <p>There are a few other methods for illustrating the relationship between sensitivity and specificity. If you prefer visual representations, you might find the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve useful. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1 – specificity) at various threshold settings, providing a visual measure of a classifier’s performance.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p268"> &#13;
   <p>Another helpful metric is the area under the curve (AUC) score, which measures the area under the ROC curve. A higher AUC score indicates a better model performance, as it implies a greater distinction between the true positive and false positive rates. This metric can be crucial for assessing the overall effectiveness of a model, especially when making decisions in scenarios with uncertain or variable thresholds.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p269"> &#13;
   <p>For those with a mathematical inclination, calculating the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) can be particularly enlightening. The MCC is a measure often used in ML to provide a balanced evaluation of binary classifications, even when the classes are of very different sizes. It returns a value between –1 and +1, where +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 indicates no better than random prediction, and –1 denotes total disagreement between prediction and observation. This coefficient is considered one of the best metrics for evaluating the quality of binary classifications because it takes into account true and false positives and negatives, providing a comprehensive overview of the model’s performance. Additionally, it condenses this information into a single number, making it particularly useful for comparing the performance of multiple models.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p270"> &#13;
   <p>Coming back to our example where we are evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of our review classification, we need accurate sentiment information for each customer review. Fortunately, our dataset includes this data in the <code>review_score</code> column. However, in most real-world scenarios, you may not have this luxury, and you will need to create a small, manually labeled dataset to assess the quality of your classification. It may be tempting to use generative AI for this tedious manual task, but it’s crucial to resist. Never ever should you utilize automatically labeled data to assess the quality of automatic labeling! Generative AI may help you in translation, but the actual reading and understanding is your part of the duty.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p271"> &#13;
   <p>We’ll assume that scores of 4 and 5 in the <code>review_score</code> column indicate positive reviews. The code that measures the sensitivity and specificity of our classification was written manually.</p> &#13;

   <p>After applying the proposed cleaning solution to our example data, the specificity of our positive review search based on keywords rose from 89% to 94%; however, its sensitivity dropped from 47% to 17%. The reason for this is pretty obvious: the keywords are not matched properly, as we have applied the <code>clean_text()</code> function to reviews but not to the list of keywords. As a result, the keywords in the list are still in their full form, while the same words in the reviews are only word roots.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p294"> &#13;
   <p>If the keywords are cleaned in the same way as the reviews, the sensitivity of our search rises to 56%, while specificity slightly drops to 83%. It is worth checking whether ChatGPT is able to come up with the reason for the sensitivity drop.</p> &#13;

   <p><strong class="response-head-image"><img alt="image" height="60px" src="../Images/Response.png" width="59px"/></strong><strong><span class="aframe-location"/></strong>The sensitivity of the positive review search might have dropped drastically after applying the proposed cleaning steps due to the stemming process. The use of stemming can sometimes lead to inaccurate results when searching for specific keywords, as it reduces words to their root form, which may not always align with the original keyword list.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p297"> &#13;
   <p>In the case of the Portuguese language, the RSLPStemmer used in the example is an algorithm specifically designed for the Portuguese language, but it is still an aggressive stemmer. It may lead to the loss of certain keyword variations, making it harder to find matches with the original keyword list.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p298"> &#13;
   <p>To address this issue, you can try one of the following approaches:</p> &#13;

   <li class="readable-text" id="p300"> Use lemmatization instead of stemming: Lemmatization is a more sophisticated technique that reduces words to their base form while considering the context and word meaning. It may preserve more of the original word structure, leading to better keyword search results. You can use the spaCy library to perform lemmatization in Portuguese: </li> &#13;

   <p>Impressive! Not only did we learn about the keyword stemming issue but also about other problems related to stemming plus the concept of lemmatization was introduced together with a way to apply it. The provided code is a modification of the code we have developed so far: the new <code>lemmatize_text()</code> function replaces the previous stemming function in the <code>clean_text()</code> function. Again, the language of our data was correctly acknowledged, and the Portuguese <code>pt_core_news_sm</code> model was proposed. The entire code, adapted to our variable names, is provided in Jupyter notebooks in our repository. If the model is not installed in your environment, you can ask generative AI for installation instructions.</p> &#13;

   <p>The new version of the positive review search that is based on lemmatized keywords and reviews has 50% sensitivity and 89% specificity. Lemmatization didn’t help much in this case, but this result is cited for the record only. As our generative AI advisor mentioned already, the choice of preprocessing techniques significantly influences the final results. Further experimentation would be required to improve the overall extraction of positive reviews with the help of keywords.</p> &#13;

   <p>The code suggested by Gemini doesn’t significantly outperform ChatGPT’s code in terms of data cleaning. Its only extra cleaning step was the removal of stopwords, acknowledging the Portuguese language—a plus for Gemini. However, this step isn’t crucial for searching single-word keywords. Moreover, Gemini employs a bit of a workaround by using the vaderSentiment package to analyze sentiment strength. While this approach isn’t entirely flawed and could potentially improve our extraction of positive reviews, the package isn’t designed for languages other than English. It attempts a workaround by translating the text into English for analysis, but as a user, I would have preferred being informed about this added layer of complexity and potential bias. Additionally, the initial version of the code had functional issues due to errors in importing nltk libraries. After Gemini failed to provide a satisfactory solution to these bugs, we had to manually correct them (the working version of the code can be found in our Jupyter notebooks). Overall, Gemini’s proposed code wasn’t more sophisticated and required more user involvement and manual adjustments, but with some effort, it could still be useful.</p> &#13;

   <p>In a perfect world, data analysts are akin to Hollywood hackers. They are expected to effortlessly devise the best strategy right off the bat and execute it flawlessly within minutes. There would be no issues with missing libraries, package conflicts, or bugs to interrupt the seamless flow of code through the command line. Ideally, they would conjure up Oscar-worthy data visualizations on the fly, delivering results just in the nick of time to avert a crisis, leaving the boss a bit shaken but with a sweet sense of mission accomplished.</p> &#13;

This is when our unsung hero, the generative AI, comes into play. Whenever you are unsure about the direction of your analysis, are in need of hints or inspiration, or only have a rough idea of what you aim to achieve, your AI advisor stands ready to lend a hand.

   <p>ChatGPT proposes to create a confusion matrix (or error matrix) containing the count of the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. These counts are then used to evaluate the performance of our classification by calculating sensitivity and specificity. The method is analogous to the one presented in listing 5.7—our manually written piece of code. When it is used to assess the efficiency of the positive reviews extraction proposed entirely by ChatGPT, both scores are very similar to our first and most basic analysis of sensitivity and specificity presented in listing 5.7. The observed differences are caused by a slightly different set of keywords being used in the analysis proposed entirely by ChatGPT.</p> &#13;

   <p>In this modified code, we calculate the average product score for both the original dataframe and the positive reviews dataframe.

You can use the seaborn library for visualization. Here’s how you can do it:</p> &#13;

   <p>This code first imports the required libraries and loads your dataset into a pandas dataframe, then follows the same steps as before to extract the positive reviews. After creating the <code>positive_reviews_df</code>, it uses seaborn to create a countplot to visualize the distribution of review scores in the extracted positive reviews.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p387"> &#13;
   <p>The countplot will show the count of reviews for each review score (1 to 5) in the extracted positive reviews dataframe. If the extraction of positive reviews is correct, you should see the majority of the reviews having high scores (e.g., 4 or 5). This would indicate that your keyword-based extraction is working well in identifying positive reviews.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p388"> &#13;
   <p>However, keep in mind that this method isn’t foolproof, as it’s possible that some positive reviews might not contain any of the specified positive keywords, or some reviews might contain a positive keyword but still be negative overall. For a more accurate extraction, you could consider using natural language processing techniques like sentiment analysis.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p389"> &#13;
   <p>The only difference in the question posed in this and the previous example is that we now specified the name for the column with review scores—this change should be irrelevant to the analysis we want to perform.

    <p>Depending on the applied temperature parameter, even a small and seemingly irrelevant change in the query (or even no change at all!) may result in a completely different solution being proposed by generative AI. It might be a good idea to repeat the query a couple of times to examine and test more than one option. Learning the fundamentals of the domain of interest will help you decide whether asking for more options is really needed and how to choose the best solution.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p392"> &#13;
   <p>The last of the proposed approaches to testing the relevance of our simple sentiment analysis was based on a visualization of the review score distribution among reviews considered positive by the keyword search. Such a method would only work if we know the distribution of scores in the entire dataset and compare it to the distribution of scores in the extracted reviews. Without such a comparison, it is not possible to assess whether the extraction of positive reviews works well. Imagine, for instance, that the review scores distribution in the entire dataset is not uniform, and most scores are 5s. The majority of review scores in the dataset of extracted reviews would also be 5s, even if the extraction were done completely at random.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p393"> &#13;
   <p>Note that ChatGPT did not propose to compare two distributions, nor did it check that the review score distribution in the entire dataset is uniform. It seems that ChatGPT simply assumed this and did not bother to inform the user about this assumption.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p394"> &#13;
   <p>Such hidden assumptions can be extremely dangerous, especially in the case of more complex datasets and analyses, where a similar mistake can be more difficult to spot. Not to mention that proper data analysis should always be preceded by data cleaning, visualization, and, above all, data understanding in order to avoid the traps of incorrect assumptions. If queried, ChatGPT will likely confirm that these are the necessary steps, but it is not guaranteed that it will remember them when asked to generate the code to perform an analysis.</p> &#13;

   <p>If your boss’s expectations include basic respect for the quality of results, you may be allowed the time necessary to go beyond counting reviews containing “good” or “bad” words (dropping into the same bucket “oh my God, oh my God, it’s sooooo good” and “not so good as advertised! avoid this piece of…,” and missing “it’s just awesome!”). </p> &#13;

   <p>As we mentioned in the introduction to this section, not all the topics you’ll analyze in your work will be unique to your business. Some things are analyzed by hundreds of people all over the world. While you could consider your set of keywords a “secret sauce” distinguishing your work from all others, it’s still good to have a solid base so as not to overlook the “secret sauce” of others. There are a lot of analyses where you can benefit from the fact that others have already put a lot of thought into it:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p404"> <em>Sentiment analysis</em><em> </em>—Dictionaries for sentiment analysis contain lists of words that are indicative of positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. These are used to gauge the overall sentiment of a piece of text toward a topic or product. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p405"> <em>Emotions</em><em> </em>—Similar to sentiment analysis but more granular, emotion dictionaries categorize words according to the specific emotions they convey, such as joy, anger, sadness, surprise, fear, and disgust. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p406"> <em>Subject-specific terminology</em><em> </em>—Many dictionaries are tailored to specific fields or subjects, such as finance, healthcare, technology, law, environment, and politics. These dictionaries contain terminologies and jargon used within those fields to help identify and analyze texts related to them. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p407"> <em>Social media analysis</em><em> </em>—With the rise of social media, dictionaries have been developed to analyze slang, abbreviations, and emojis commonly used on social media platforms to understand public opinion, trends, and behaviors. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p408"> <em>Opinion mining</em><em> </em>—Apart from detecting sentiments, dictionaries are used to identify opinions regarding products, services, or policies. This is particularly useful in market research and public policy analysis. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p409"> <em>Cultural references</em><em> </em>—Dictionaries may also cover slang, idioms, and cultural references to understand texts better and interpret meanings that rely on cultural knowledge. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p410"> <em>Domain-specific sentiments</em><em> </em>—In areas like finance or healthcare, dictionaries can identify terms that, while neutral in general language, carry positive or negative connotations within the specific domain (e.g., “volatility” in finance). </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p411"> <em>Intent detection</em><em> </em>—Some dictionaries are designed to detect the intent behind a query or statement, such as informational, transactional, or navigational intents, which are crucial for applications like chatbots and customer service automation. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p412"> &#13;
   <p>Such a set of keywords related to a specific topic is called a “dictionary” or a “lexicon.” However, dictionaries are much more than the set of keywords we hastily prepared earlier in this chapter. Here are some of the key features and components that can be included in advanced text-mining dictionaries:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p413"> <em>Part-of-speech </em>(POS) <em>tags</em><em> </em>—Dictionaries often include POS tags for each word, specifying whether it is a noun, verb, adjective, etc. This information helps in understanding the role of a word within a sentence, which is crucial for accurate parsing and interpretation of text. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p414"> <em>Sentiment scores</em><em> </em>—For sentiment analysis, dictionaries may assign scores to words that reflect the degree of positivity, negativity, or neutrality. These scores allow for a more quantitative analysis of sentiment rather than a simple positive/negative classification. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p415"> <em>Semantic information</em><em> </em>—Some dictionaries provide semantic information, such as synonyms, antonyms, and semantic relationships between words. This can help in understanding the context and nuances of language use. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p416"> <em>Frequency information</em><em> </em>—The inclusion of word frequency data (how often a word is typically used in the language or within specific corpora) can help in weighting the importance of words in text analysis. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p417"> <em>Multi-word expressions</em><em> </em>—Phrases or idioms that carry specific meanings are included as single entries. This is important because the meaning of the whole expression can differ significantly from the meanings of its individual words. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p418"> <em>Contextual rules</em><em> </em>—Some dictionaries include rules or patterns that describe how the meaning or relevance of a word might change depending on its context. This can be particularly useful for words that have multiple meanings or that can serve different functions in a sentence. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p419"> <em>Domain-specific attributes</em><em> </em>—For dictionaries focusing on specific fields or industries, entries might include attributes relevant to the domain, such as the relevance of a term to certain subfields or its regulatory significance. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p420"> <em>Cultural and regional variations</em><em> </em>—Words or phrases that have different meanings or connotations in different cultures or regions can be annotated with this information, which is essential for analyzing texts from diverse sources. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p421"> <em>Emotion intensity</em><em> </em>—Similar to sentiment scores, some dictionaries provide intensity levels for emotions, which can help in distinguishing between texts that express strong versus mild emotions. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p422"> <em>Usage tags</em><em> </em>—Information about the usage of a word (e.g., formal, informal, slang, offensive) can also be included, which is valuable for analyzing texts with varying levels of formality or for filtering out inappropriate content. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p423"> &#13;
   <p>The effectiveness of dictionary-based approaches hinges on the quality of the dictionary, but unlike simple keyword detection, these methods can analyze the complexity of word relationships and contexts, evaluating sentiment intensity or recognizing when negations change a statement’s meaning.</p> &#13;

   <h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_86"><span class="num-string">5.6.2</span> Finding resources</h3> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p425"> &#13;
   <p>The indisputable requirement of applying dictionary-based methods is the availability of a proper dictionary. When choosing the right lexicon for a specific task, several factors need to be carefully considered to ensure that the chosen resource effectively meets the needs of your project:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p426"> <em>Relevance and coverage</em><em> </em>—The first step is to assess the relevance and coverage of the lexicon. Ensure that the lexicon covers the specific domain or subject area of your project. For example, a lexicon that excels in medical terminology might not be suitable for analyzing texts related to finance. Additionally, the lexicon should have sufficient breadth and depth—meaning it should include a wide range of terms and provide detailed information about each term, such as the part of speech, connotations, and usage in different contexts. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p427"> <em>Accuracy and currency</em><em> </em>—Evaluating the accuracy and currency of the lexicon is crucial. The definitions and associations within the lexicon should be accurate and reflect current usage, especially in rapidly evolving fields. Checking the source and date of publication can provide insights into the reliability and modernity of the lexicon. For tasks involving slang or contemporary language, newer lexicons or those regularly updated are preferable. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p428"> <em>Bias and limitations</em><em> </em>—Every lexicon carries inherent biases and limitations that can impact the outcomes of your analysis. It’s important to identify these biases—whether they are cultural, linguistic, or domain-specific—and consider how they might affect your results. For instance, a lexicon developed with data from one geographic region might not be appropriate for analyzing language use in another region. In cases where biases cannot be completely eliminated, being transparent about these limitations in your analysis can help mitigate potential issues. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p429"> &#13;
   <p>In summary, do not limit your lexicon search to the first result in the web browser. Consider multiple lexicons and perform pilot tests to compare how they impact the outcomes of your specific task. You may also benefit from reviewing research papers associated with existing lexicons. Often, these papers detail the efficacy of a particular dictionary, which can save you the effort of conducting tests yourself.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p430"> &#13;
   <p>However, you may soon realize that this approach is more challenging than expected, especially when searching for lexicons in languages other than English, which are often described in—surprise—their native languages. Another potential frustration is discovering that many academic tools become unavailable once their funding for maintenance ceases. To navigate these challenges, you’ll need guidance toward a few enduring solutions. Fortunately, you have access to an advisor who can provide just that.</p> &#13;

Here are some strategies to acquire a sentiment lexicon for Portuguese:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p433"> &#13;
   <p>Use Existing Lexicons</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p434"> &#13;
   <p>OPINLEX: This is a lexicon specifically designed for Portuguese. It includes a list of opinion words that can be very useful for sentiment analysis tasks.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p435"> &#13;
   <p>SentiLex: This is another lexicon for Portuguese, focusing on sentiment analysis. It provides polarity for a large number of words and can be a good starting point for your analysis.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p436"> &#13;
   <p>LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count): The Portuguese version of LIWC can be used for sentiment analysis as it categorizes words into various emotional, cognitive, and structural components. However, LIWC is not free, and you would need to purchase it.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p437"> &#13;
   <p>Public repositories and datasets: Platforms like GitHub or research article repositories may have sentiment lexicons available for download. These can sometimes be found as supplementary materials in academic articles on sentiment analysis in Portuguese.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p438"> &#13;
   <p>Building Your Own Lexicon</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p439"> &#13;
   <p>If existing lexicons do not meet your requirements, you might consider building your own. Here are a few approaches:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p440"> &#13;
   <p>Translation and Adaptation: Start with an English sentiment lexicon (like AFINN, VADER, or SentiWordNet) and translate the words into Portuguese. Be mindful that direct translation might not always capture the sentiment accurately due to cultural and contextual differences. After translation, manually adjust the list based on your understanding of the language and context.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p441"> &#13;
   <p>Manual Creation: Gather a team of native speakers and manually create a list of words associated with positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. This approach is time-consuming but can result in a highly customized and accurate lexicon for your specific needs.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p442"> &#13;
   <p>Crowdsourcing: Use platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk or Figure Eight to crowdsource the sentiment classification of words. This is a more scalable way to manually create a lexicon, although it still requires careful quality control.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p443"> &#13;
   <p>Bootstrapping: Start with a small set of seed words and use a corpus to find words that frequently appear in similar contexts (using techniques like co-occurrence analysis). Assign sentiment scores to these new words based on the scores of the seed words they are associated with. This method can be semi-automated but requires initial manual effort and continuous refinement.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p444"> &#13;
   <p>Utilizing Machine Learning: Train a model to classify words into sentiment categories based on a corpus of labeled text. This approach requires a substantial amount of labeled data and computational resources but can be effective in creating a comprehensive lexicon.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p445"> &#13;
   <p>Regardless of the approach, validation and refinement are key. Test the lexicon with a set of labeled data to evaluate its performance, and iteratively refine it based on the results. Remember, the appropriateness of a lexicon can vary greatly depending on the context and domain of your text data, so customization and ongoing adjustment are often necessary for optimal results.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p446"> &#13;
   <p>ChatGPT’s advice on selecting the optimal lexicon for our needs is incredibly useful. It outlines several existing lexicons and suggests the possibility of creating a custom one from scratch. While the list provided might not be the most current, using another model like Gemini to search for the latest solutions is always an option. However, it’s worth noting that ChatGPT doesn’t offer specific download links for models unless explicitly instructed to find the latest web resources. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p447"> &#13;
   <p>Let’s say we decide to incorporate the SentiLex lexicon into our research. After conducting a manual web search on 23 February 2023, we downloaded the lexicon from the eudat.eu service (<a href="https://b2share.eudat.eu/records/93ab120efdaa4662baec6adee8e7585f">https://b2share.eudat.eu/records/93ab120efdaa4662baec6adee8e7585f</a>). However, we found the file to be somewhat confusing.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p449"> &#13;
   <p>The downloaded sentiment lexicon, after unzipping, turned out to be a collection of two separate files: SentiLex-flex-PT02.txt and SentiLex-lem-PT02.txt. As the naming convention is pretty standard for this type of resource, it is likely that our generative AI would be able to tell us something about these files.</p> &#13;

   <p><strong class="response-head-image"><img alt="image" height="60px" src="../Images/Response.png" width="59px"/></strong><strong><span class="aframe-location"/></strong>The two files you have found for the sentiment lexicon for Portuguese are likely to contain different representations of the lexicon. Here’s a brief explanation of what each file might contain:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p452"> &#13;
   <p>SentiLex-flex-PT02.txt: This file is likely to contain a list of words along with their associated part-of-speech (POS) tags and polarity scores. The POS tags indicate the grammatical category of each word (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, etc.). This file may be useful if you want to perform sentiment analysis that takes into account the syntactic structure of the text.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p453"> &#13;
   <p>SentiLex-lem-PT02.txt: This file is likely to contain a list of lemmas (base forms of words) along with their associated polarity scores. This file may be useful if you want to perform sentiment analysis that is based on the overall sentiment of a text, rather than the sentiment of individual words.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p454"> &#13;
   <p>Which file to use depends on your specific use case and the goals of your sentiment analysis. If you want to perform sentiment analysis that takes into account the grammatical structure of the text, you may want to use the SentiLex-flex-PT02.txt file. If you are more interested in the overall sentiment of a text, you may want to use the SentiLex-lem-PT02.txt file.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p455"> &#13;
   <p>If you’re unsure which file to use, you could also consider trying both and comparing the results. You may find that one file works better for your specific dataset or task.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p456"> &#13;

   <p>Important Considerations</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p466"> &#13;
   <p>Lexicon Format: The example assumes the SentiLex lexicon is in a CSV file with the structure described. You may need to adjust the loading mechanism based on the actual format of your SentiLex file.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p467"> &#13;
   <p>Encoding: Make sure to match the encoding of the SentiLex file when loading it. The example uses UTF-8, which is common, but your file might differ.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p468"> &#13;
   <p>Word Matching: The effectiveness of this approach heavily depends on how well the preprocessing of your text matches the words in the SentiLex lexicon. Pay special attention to stemming, lemmatization, and accent normalization if these aspects are relevant to how the lexicon was constructed.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p469"> &#13;
   <p>Polarity Scores: The example assumes that the SentiLex lexicon provides polarity scores directly. If the lexicon uses different methods to denote sentiment (e.g., categorical labels or multiple dimensions of emotion), you’ll need to adjust the scoring logic accordingly.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p470"> &#13;
   <p>Integrating a specific lexicon like SentiLex can significantly enhance the relevance and accuracy of sentiment analysis for Portuguese texts by leveraging linguistic insights specific to the language.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p471"> &#13;
   <p>There is a problem with the provided code, which is a good learning opportunity for us. The lexicon we plan to use is not in CSV format, so it will require further adjustments to be compatible with our code. In the good old days of manually searching Stack Overflow, we’d probably start looking for a way to transform our lexicon to a required format. This process would often lead to several failed attempts, such as encountering unexpected header discrepancies, before finally achieving success. However, this approach would leave us drained before we even began the actual analysis. Generative AI changes that completely. You really, really need to remember that your AI advisor is not your last resort. It should be the first one. </p> &#13;

   <p>File Path: Replace <code>path_to_sentilex.txt</code> with the actual path to your SentiLex file.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p484"> &#13;
   <p>Encoding: This example uses UTF-8 encoding to open the file, which is generally standard. However, if your file uses a different encoding, you might need to adjust this parameter.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p485"> &#13;
   <p>Polarity Score: The example assumes the polarity score is an integer. If your scores are in a different format (e.g., floating-point numbers or categorical labels), you may need to adjust the parsing logic.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p486"> &#13;
   <p>Error Handling: Depending on the consistency of your SentiLex file format, you might want to add error handling to manage lines that don’t conform to the expected format.</p> &#13;

   <p>We can merge the proposed solutions to create a complete code snippet (available in our Jupyter notebooks). Yet the outcome leaves much to be desired. With a specificity of 0.88 but a sensitivity of only 0.36, it’s clear our classification misses many positive reviews. Can we enhance our method for identifying positive reviews?</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p490"> &#13;
   <p>So far, we’ve intentionally overlooked a crucial aspect of our lexicon—it comprises lemmas. Typically, these are in the masculine singular form for adjectives, singular for countable nouns, and infinitive for verbs and idiomatic expressions, which can significantly differ from the actual words found in customer reviews. To refine our analysis, the reviews should also be converted into a collection of lemmas prior to conducting the dictionary-based search. It’s noteworthy that ChatGPT initially overlooked this essential detail. However, upon direct inquiry, it acknowledges our concerns and suggests a solution.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text prompt" id="p491"> &#13;
   <p><strong class="prompt-head-image"><img alt="image" height="67px" src="../Images/Init-MA.png" width="66px"/></strong><strong><span class="aframe-location"/></strong>The results of our sentiment analysis are pretty poor and it seems we have low sensitivity in extracting positive reviews. It might be because our lexicon is a collection of lemmas. Can you adapt the code accordingly?</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p492"> &#13;
   <p><strong class="response-head-image"><img alt="image" height="60px" src="../Images/Response.png" width="59px"/></strong><strong><span class="aframe-location"/></strong>If the lexicon is based on lemmas but your preprocessing step does not include lemmatization, there’s a mismatch that could indeed lead to low sensitivity in detecting sentiments, especially positive ones if those are underrepresented in their non-lemmatized form in your analysis. To address this, you need to include a lemmatization step in your preprocessing, which aligns the words in your reviews with the lemma forms in your lexicon.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p493"> &#13;
   <p>Lemmatization in Portuguese can be more challenging than in English due to the language’s richer morphology. However, the NLTK library, combined with other tools like spaCy, which has support for Portuguese, can be used for this task. First, ensure you have spaCy installed and have downloaded the Portuguese language model. If not, you can install spaCy and download the model as follows:</p> &#13;

   </div> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p495"> &#13;
   <p>Here's how to adapt the preprocessing function to include lemmatization for Portuguese:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p496"> &#13;
   <div class="code-area-container code-area-with-html"> &#13;
    <pre class="code-area">import spacy&#13;
&#13;
<em># Load the Portuguese language model</em>&#13;
nlp = spacy.load('pt_core_news_sm')&#13;
&#13;
def preprocess_and_lemmatize(text):&#13;
    text = unidecode(text.lower())  <em># Normalize</em>&#13;
    doc = nlp(text)&#13;
    lemmas = [token.lemma_ for token in doc if token.is_alpha and &#13;
<span class="">↪</span>       åtoken.lemma_ not in stop_words]&#13;
    return lemmas&#13;
&#13;
<em># Update the DataFrame processing line to use the new preprocessing </em>&#13;

df['processed_reviews'] = df['reviews'].apply(preprocess_and_lemmatize)</pre>  &#13;
   </div> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p497"> &#13;
   <p>In this code snippet:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p498"> &#13;
   <p>We use spaCy’s Portuguese model (<code>pt_core_news_sm</code>) to process each review.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p499"> &#13;
   <p>For each token in a processed document (<code>doc</code>), we extract its lemma using <code>token .lemma_</code> if it’s an alphabetic word and not in the stop words list.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p500"> &#13;
   <p>The preprocessing function now returns a list of lemmas instead of the original tokens.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p501"> &#13;
   <p>After adapting the preprocessing step to include lemmatization, your sentiment analysis should better align with the lemma-based lexicon, potentially improving the sensitivity and overall accuracy of positive sentiment detection.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p502"> &#13;
   <p>Keep in mind that the effectiveness of this adjustment also depends on the quality and coverage of your lexicon. If you continue to experience low performance, you might need to revisit your lexicon to ensure it adequately represents the range of positive sentiment expressions in your dataset.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p503"> &#13;
   <p>The solution to lemmatize the input was integrated into a previously developed solution and is available in the Jupyter notebook in our GitHub repository. The resulting quality of our positive reviews extraction is marked by a sensitivity of 0.41 and specificity of 0.85. This is an improvement, yet there’s still potential for further refinement. Would we do any better if we applied a dedicated pretrained model for sentiment analysis? We will check that in the next chapter.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p504"> &#13;
   <p>What’s particularly interesting is the noticeable enhancement in ChatGPT’s output quality over time. Conducting a similar task nearly a year ago, we found that although ChatGPT could lead us to an appropriate solution, adapting the methods to our specific data posed several challenges. Currently, ChatGPT makes fewer errors and is more adept at retaining the context of our analysis, contributing to a more seamless experience. This trend suggests that we might see even more significant advancements in the near future.</p> &#13;
