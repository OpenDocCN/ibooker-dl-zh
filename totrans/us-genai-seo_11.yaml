    functions. LLMs and generative AI will continue to evolve, and you must account
    for those changes in your future SEO strategies. In this section, we’ll discuss
    what you can expect of generative AI in the future and how that will affect SEO
    professionals and business owners.

    content. Text content will sound more humanlike. As a result, marketing content—including
    ad copy—will be more appealing to customers. Images and videos will look more
    realistic and natural. SEO practitioners will find it easier to develop content.
    This doesn’t change the fact that AI-generated content will still need human oversight.
    As we’ve emphasized throughout this book, if you do not have a human reviewer,
    you risk your brand’s reputation by putting out content rife with misinformation
    and inaccuracies or content that sounds too robotic to resonate with users. In
    addition, you have lost the opportunity to put forth your organization’s perspective
    and insights.

    Laws currently are not set up to protect non-human-generated art and text. In
    the future, we’ll see more regulations to control what can be owned and what constitutes
    copyright infringement as artists’ work is used to train AI models. More laws
    will oversee and limit the use of other art to generate images. However, SEO practitioners
    will continue to use generative AI to create basic logos and for image search
    and editing. For more details, see [“Copyright Concerns”](ch02.html#ch02_copyright_concerns_1748358211790817).

    we’ll discuss in the following sections of this chapter. Users will see more AI-generated
    content alongside traditional search results, which could affect trust and search
    engine ranking. Companies that offer users informational content will need to
    focus on getting their content to become one of the sources for AI-generated responses
    in addition to ranking in traditional search results. Companies will compete for
    their pages to be used as part of the AI search overviews.

    to increase the velocity of coding websites and desktop and mobile applications.
    From user interface designs developed for better optimization and engagement to
    backend code snippets, generative AI can help get your websites and applications
    in front of customers sooner.

    producers. AI models will get better at processing videos and producing accurate
    subtitles, alternative text, and transcripts. It’s also foreseeable that translations
    of video into other languages will improve.

    remember that your primary focus should continue to be on quality and providing
    value to users. Having authoritative content will become more important than in
    previous years because generative AI tool vendors will strive to use trustworthy
    content. SEO professionals will need SMEs and careful oversight of any generative
    AI content to ensure that it meets Google’s authoritative content expectations.

    search engines in order to gain relevant traffic to the website—faces a significant
    shift with the rise of generative AI. However, it’s unlikely that generative AI
    will completely replace search engines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a significant amount. Generative AI requires massive amounts of data, and Google
    has the most data in the world from its years of cataloging the web, understanding
    user intent and relevancy, and identifying authorities on a wide range of topics.
    In addition, Google has built a massive repository of facts called the [Knowledge
    Graph](https://oreil.ly/IwSxk), which provides it with a way to validate content
    accuracy.

- en: Many users will move to using generative AI instead of search engines to find
    information. For example, when a user uses a search engine to look for pizza places,
    their query might ask Google to find pizza restaurants close to their location.
    This query doesn’t always return an exact match. The top three ranking restaurants
    might have long wait times or not have the user’s preferred menu item. These specifics
    are likely found in the customer feedback, and generative AI ingests and processes
    feedback. Users will then go to their favorite AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT or Copilot)
    to ask questions rather than rely on search engine results.
  prefs: []

    Suppose the LLM returns the same three results as Google. The user can then ask
    the LLM to give them results based on other ingested information like wait times,
    menu items, and customer feedback that wouldn’t be part of on-site content. This
    gives SEO professionals another type of information to target on their sites:
    information that addresses follow-up questions. Authoritative content that focuses
    on these kinds of follow-up questions could help sites become a reference in an
    LLM output.'

    search assistance. Instead of targeting web page content, SEO practitioners will
    need to focus on injecting their brands into recommendations offered by smartphone
    AI assistants. These assistants may be even smarter in the future and will begin
    giving suggestions before the user asks. For example, suppose a smartphone user
    regularly buys flowers on a specific day for their spouse’s birthday. The assistant
    could recommend flower stores before the user performs a search. SEO practitioners
    will need to create strategies for being one of the top—or *the* top—recommendations.

    answers from search queries lowered organic traffic by 18%–64% and reduced CTR

    generative AI could be Google’s next move for its search strategy. For example,
    some number-one results have been pushed down by 640 pixels, but this ranges between
    200 and 2,000 pixels depending on Google’s experiments, according to the same
    *Search Engine Land* article. When your site is affected, you may see the same

    on the nature of the query. As an example, suppose a user asks Google to display
    the “best vacuum cleaner.” The “best” vacuum cleaner is subjective, and AI is
    not valuable for opinions (people generally want the opinions of experts or other
    people who have used the product). Having a short snippet at the top of search
    results isn’t beneficial for users in this scenario either because they likely
    want to see real human reviews and need to decide on purchasing the best appliance.
    Shopping and ecommerce SEO professionals will still find themselves working to
    rank their sites in these types of traditional search results as AIOs will have
    less of a presence. That said, Google is likely going to value human-generated
    content for these types of queries, such as Reddit, review sites ([*Trustpilot.com*](https://www.trustpilot.com),
    [*ConsumerAffairs.com*](https://www.consumeraffairs.com), and others), or other

    need to cover search queries. Instead, SEO professionals need to find ways to
    get their products shown in ChatGPT Search.

    strategy to cover as many search queries as possible that users might use when
    searching for a product or service like what your organization offers. For example,
    some potential customers could be looking for eco-friendly cars, another group
    of people might be searching for cars that are best for long-distance commutes,
    and others might be looking for sports cars. The current goal of SEO is to show
    up in Google search results for various search queries. Ideally, SEO practitioners
    strive to appear in the first three results, or at least on the first page. Not
    every search query has the same search volume and intent, but SEO aims to drive
    traffic to your employer’s site to then sell its product.

    interested in, and the LLM provides a list of suggestions. Google’s search results
    are vastly different. Right now, Google doesn’t give you a list of links to cars.
    Instead, it gives you links to discussions where people talk about cars. Let’s
    look at the query “I’m looking for a car that’s good for California driving and
    off-road trails” for both Google and OpenAI. First, let’s look at the initial
    links in Google’s search results, shown in [Figure 8-4](#ch08_figure_3_1748358221779556).

    results are based on discussions or reviews provided by third-party sites. The
    results don’t provide direct suggestions for car manufacturers or models, so users
    must click links and read more to figure out the best car for what they want.

    three direct suggestions. For an SEO practitioner, your new goal will be to get
    your organization into these search results. You may even need to create content
    that can be used in generative AI search results for better conversions once users
    land on your pages. You may want to shift toward focusing on earning placements
    in generative AI search results.

- en: In December 2023, DeepSeek was released to the public. The new Chinese models
    are open source—meaning the parameters for models are made publicly available
    (also known as *open**weight*)—and DeepSeek is seen as a significant competitor
    to OpenAI. A major feature of DeepSeek that attracts users is its [user price](https://oreil.ly/pGggM).
    Users pay about $3 for one million tokens, which give you about 80,000 words.
    Compare this cost to $15 on OpenAI for the same number of tokens. This inexpensive
    alternative to OpenAI could mean more users flocking to DeepSeek instead of using
    OpenAI. Cheaper generative AI could attract more users to content creation and
    other SEO benefits at a much greater scale at a lower cost. The lower cost also
    gives smaller businesses the opportunity to leverage generative AI.

- en: DeepSeek is a lower-cost LLM option, so it’s likely that others will find ways
    to reduce the costs of training these models. Cheaper costs benefit SEO practitioners
    who might not work for an organization with high-end marketing budgets, which
    brings more competition to the industry. You should expect to see many other new
    LLMs emerge over time. These will give SEO practitioners more options and add
    competition to the market. Even with other LLMs in the market, SEO will not be
    eliminated. Some of the work will now focus on GEO and become more competitive
    for brands.

    producing complete and accurate humanlike output. Images, videos, and text often
    have elements that give them away as being created by a bot. Although sometimes
    the signs are subtle, as people become more familiar with AI-generated content,
    their ability to discern it will grow.

- en: 'Nevertheless, generative AI will continue to evolve, and we can expect significant
    improvements in its ability to create more humanlike output. It might take many
    years to get there, but generative AI is still at the beginning stages of its
    evolution. While it might seem like generative AI cannot replace human-made art
    or writing, it will improve. In years to come, it will be less and less distinguishable
    from human-made content. Automation using generative AI will make SEO tasks more
    efficient, and some jobs traditionally done by humans might go away. SEO practitioners
    will need to “skill up” and find ways to work with new search engine strategies:
    strategies that include focusing more on the AI snippets at the top and less on
    displaying links to users.'

- en: DeepSeek and other innovative generative AI technology have already reduced
    the number of “hallucinations” when models don’t have the right answers. Instead
    of relying on human researchers, generative AI can work with thousands of academic
    journals and sources to produce more accurate answers. The benefits will continue
    to grow, and generative AI will become an important asset for critical industries
    like health care. For example, doctors could get information about treatments
    based on symptoms to help them better treat their patients. It’s likely that many
    other industries will leverage generative AI to speed up productivity and provide
    a better quality of life.

    of AI output will take time. It may not happen next year or the year after, but
    it will within a few years and over the next decade. The generative AI you know
    today will be vastly different and more accurate in 10 years. For SEO practitioners
    to keep pace with generative AI, they need to continually experiment with changes,
    adapt their strategies, and work with AI models that produce output for their
    brand. If you aren’t using or planning to use the advanced technologies discussed
    in [Chapter 6](ch06.html#ch06_advanced_use_cases_for_generative_ai_in_seo_1748359259642070),
