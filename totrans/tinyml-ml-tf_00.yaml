- en: Something about electronics has captured my imagination for as long as I can
    remember. We’ve learned to dig rocks from the earth, refine them in mysterious
    ways, and produce a dizzying array of tiny components that we combine—according
    to arcane laws—to imbue them with some essence of life.

- en: To my eight-year-old mind, a battery, switch, and filament bulb were enchanting
    enough, let alone the processor inside my family’s home computer. And as the years
    have passed, I’ve developed some understanding of the principles of electronics
    and software that make these inventions work. But what has always struck me is
    the way a system of simple elements can come together to create a subtle and complex
    thing, and deep learning really takes this to new heights.

    understands how to see. It’s made up of thousands of virtual “neurons,” each of
    which follows some simple rules and outputs a single number. Alone, each neuron
    isn’t capable of much, but combined, and—through training—given a spark of human
    knowledge, they can make sense of our complex world.

    made from sand, metal, and plastic can embody a fragment of human understanding.
    This is the essence of TinyML, a term that Pete coined and will introduce in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#intro).
    In the pages of this book, you’ll find the tools you’ll need to build these things
    yourself.'

    hard to keep things simple and explain all the concepts that you’ll need. We hope
    you enjoy what we’ve written, and we’re excited to see what you create!
