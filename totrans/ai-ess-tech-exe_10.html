<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>In this guide, we’ve covered a lot of ground. Below are three main
ideas that we hope you’ll take away:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop chasing AI tools and focus on process first.</li>
<li>Look at your raw data—don’t trust metrics blindly.</li>
<li>Build AI features that amplify your existing advantages through the
right strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it’s time to put them into practice. Here are some resources you
can use to learn more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our <a href="https://bit.ly/evals-ai">four-week live-cohort course on evals</a>. Learn a systematic approach for improving AI applications, regardless of the domain or use case.</li>
<li><a href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/course">Our survey
course on LLMs</a>, taught by practitioners. This is more technical than
this guide, but it’s a good resource for engineering teams to up-level on
AI.</li>
<li>The O’Reilly article <a href="https://applied-llms.org">“What We
Learned From A Year Building With LLMs”</a>, written by Eugene Yan, Bryan
Bischof, Charles Frye, Hamel Husain, Shreya Shankar, and Jason Liu.</li>
</ul>
