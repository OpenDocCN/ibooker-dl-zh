- en: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a core area of research and development
    for computer scientists and engineers for decades. While the potential of AI remained
    constrained by hardware and software for years, recent breakthroughs have allowed
    product managers to harness AI’s power, scaling it into practical and impactful
    solutions.

- en: In 2023, the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and similar large language models transformed
    the landscape of digital products, empowering product managers to infuse AI into
    user experiences in ways that were unimaginable just a year before. In the span
    of a year, the market has seen a Cambrian explosion of generative AI models, from
    image generation tools like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E to advanced
    search solutions like Deepseek—and even multimodal AI systems like Google’s Gemini.
    As of 2024, most tech companies are focused on integrating some aspect of AI into
    their products, with many prioritizing the transition from task-specific AI solutions
    to general-purpose AI and building new user experiences with multimodal AI and
    personalized AI agents.

    Management* is a road map for navigating the complexities of creating AI-driven
    products. Drawing on my experiences at Google and Meta, and complemented by insights
    from the AI Product Academy, this guide aims to equip product managers, entrepreneurs,
    and business leaders with the tools and frameworks to confidently integrate AI
    into their work.'

- en: 'AI product management is uniquely challenging. Unlike traditional product development,
    AI systems are probabilistic, depend on high-quality data, and demand continuous
    learning and optimization. Concepts such as large language models, retrieval-augmented
    generation, and model fine-tuning are critical to understand, yet they often feel
    inaccessible to nontechnical PMs. This is why I founded the AI Product Academy,
    which provides AI Product Management certifications, and it is the reason I wrote
    this book: to bridge the gap between niche AI technologies and solve user pain
    points in impactful ways. The book offers actionable guidance, practical tools,
    and case studies to help you navigate the intricate AI Product Development Lifecycle,
    tackle strategic and ethical considerations, and build products that are both
    innovative and user centric.'
