    enough love: debugging, testing, and deployment. It’s a guide to everything from
    spotting different bugs, to writing docs that people can actually understand,
    to making sure your code does what it’s supposed to. We’ll also dive into how
    to merge changes without a hitch, make your software run smoothly and safely,
    take in what users say, and even how to make a splash when you launch.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When creating code, a developer will spend around [35% to 50% of their time
    on debugging](https://oreil.ly/vci4A). This is not just a time sink. It also eats
    up a big chunk of the budget in a software project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are two main types of bugs. First, there are *syntax errors*. These pop
    up when your code doesn’t play by the rules of the structure of a language. It
    can be as simple as forgetting to add a colon at the end of a `for` loop. A modern
    IDE like VS Code should detect and fix many of these types of errors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, there are *logical errors*. These are trickier because they happen when
    something in your logic is off. For example, suppose you have created a program
    to filter out adult users from a list based on their age. The only problem is,
    instead of excluding everyone aged 18 and above, your code mistakenly excludes
    those under 18\. So, you end up with a list full of adults instead of teens. This
    mix-up is a prime example of a logical error. Your code is doing the exact opposite
    of what you intended. Pinpointing why it’s flagging the under-18 crowd, instead
    of those 18 and above, can be quite the puzzle. The fix can range from making
    a quick adjustment in the age condition to having to rethink the whole logic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless, using an AI-assisted programming tool is not something you should
    start off with when debugging. Often, traditional approaches should be fine. VS
    Code provides powerful debugging features that can detect and resolve problems.
    After all, you can easily set up breakpoints to inspect variable values, walk
    through the code line by line, and see what’s exactly happening. These are a lifesaver,
    especially in large programs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But of course, some bugs can be real head-scratchers. Modern software is often
    a complex puzzle with many layers and parts that have to work together. Sometimes
    a bug pops up because these parts interact in unexpected ways, and figuring out
    what’s actually going wrong can be a real challenge. Then there’s the issue of
    documentation—or the lack of it. When software doesn’t come with clear instructions
    or explanations, it’s tough to understand how it’s supposed to work, which makes
    finding and fixing bugs even harder. Your software will usually rely on external
    libraries or services, and if something goes wrong there, the bugs in your software
    can be maddening.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is where you can turn to AI. For example, one scenario is deciphering
    cryptic or long error messages. These may be stack traces, for instance, which
    are snapshots of what the program was doing when everything went haywire. You
    might also get detailed information about the interactions among various frameworks
    and libraries.

    it’s usually shoved to the back burner. We’ve all seen it—working with code without
    a guide is like wandering in a maze, and it’s a pain, especially for new folks
    or anyone trying to figure things out.
  prefs: []

- en: In a way, unit tests are mini evaluations for parts of your code, say for a
    few functions or methods. Developers often do this testing themselves using cool
    tools like JUnit for Java, NUnit for .NET, or pytest for Python. These tools help
    write and run tests, and tell you the results. They usually play nice with other
    software tools you’re using.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Doing unit testing is helpful because it makes your software better, cuts down
    on pesky bugs, and makes it easier to tweak and fix problems later. Each test
    focuses on just one thing, so if something goes wrong, you know exactly where
    to look. These tests are usually automated, which means they can be run fast and
    often. This is important for keeping everything smooth and up-to-date.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of the code, they shouldn’t be too complicated. Plus, they’re like a guide to
    your software. By checking out the unit tests, other developers can get how certain
    parts are supposed to work. If you change your code, unit tests are great for
    making sure you haven’t messed up something that was working fine before.

    can help verify that the function correctly calculates the total amount, including
    tips, for a range of inputs. This is important because even a small error can
    lead to significant discrepancies. Unit tests can cover typical cases, such as
    standard bill amounts and tip percentages, as well as edge cases, like a zero
    or negative bill amount or unusually high tip percentages. They also help to ensure
    that the function handles wonky inputs, such as non-numeric or null values, gracefully.

    you’ve done, give it a thumbs up, or maybe throw in some pointers to make it even
    better. It’s all about making sure that when your code joins the rest of the project,

- en: User feedback is key to making your software rock. When your users see you’re
    tuning in and making changes based on their thoughts, they’re more likely to stick
    around and be all smiles. It’s smarter to iron out the kinks early with their
    help, rather than try to clean up a big mess later when a lot of (increasingly
    unhappy) folks are using your app.

    your software hits the real world. Your users are like your own personal detectives,
    spotting the stuff that might have slipped past you.

    you never dreamed of. Their wild ideas can light the spark for new features, or
    even brand-new products.

    tools include Zendesk, Freshdesk, Drift, and Salesforce. They are handy with everything
    from live chat that lets you talk to customers in real time to feedback forms
    that gather insights on what your users think. Automated ticketing systems keep
    track of customer issues, ensuring that nothing slips through the cracks. And
    don’t forget about customer relationship management (CRM) systems, which keep
    all customer interactions in one place. These tools can really make a difference
    in providing efficient, responsive customer service.

    good at processing large amounts of unstructured data like user feedback.

    contact form information from users. You can then go to ChatGPT and use this prompt:'

    features, bugs, and customer service. Also, do sentiment analysis on this file.
    Based on the frequency and severity of issues mentioned, help prioritize which
    bugs to fix first or which features to consider adding. With all this, create
    a report that includes charts.'

    customer feedback, it can help you write better responses, such as by creating
    templates for answers to common questions. This way, you’re always on point and
    professional when you’re chatting with users or customers.

    feedback. This is what Warp did. The company had a developer spend less than a
    week—at half-time—to create the app. It was built using the OpenAI API.

    at Warp. “Before, it was difficult to categorize and prioritize the incoming feedback.
    But the generative AI has been able to do this extremely well.”

- en: Several years before ChatGPT became a big deal, generative AI was already making
    an impact on important activities like sales and marketing. The trailblazer was
    Jasper. The company grew at a staggering rate. Then again, generative AI is ideal
    for whipping up catchy and creative content—fast.

    fine. First of all, you can start mapping out a killer marketing plan with it.
    Here’s a sample prompt:'

    custom meal plans based on dietary preferences, health goals, and nutritional
    needs. It can also generate shopping lists, offer recipe suggestions, and track
    nutritional intake. For this app, put together a marketing plan. The company is
    an early-stage startup and does not have much resources for a marketing budget.'

    that the primary users are “health-conscious individuals, fitness enthusiasts,
    people with specific dietary needs (e.g., gluten-free, vegan), busy professionals,
    etc.” It then covers various strategies, such as leveraging social media, content
    marketing, community engagement, email marketing, and partnerships.

- en: This chapter is like a behind-the-scenes look at the things in software development
    that don’t always get the spotlight. Sure, creating new software is thrilling,
    but it’s the less flashy tasks like debugging, testing, and documentation that
    really make or break your app. We’ve talked about how AI tools, like ChatGPT,
    can make these jobs a lot smoother. These AI buddies aren’t magic fixes, but they’re
    pretty awesome at sifting through tons of data, giving advice, whipping up content,
    spotting problems, and speeding up the whole process. This means developers get
    to focus on the really tricky stuff. By bringing generative AI and some smart
    strategies into every step, from squashing bugs to launching, developers can build
    better software that really hits the mark for users—and do it quicker too.
