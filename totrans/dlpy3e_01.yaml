    media hype. Machine learning, deep learning, and AI come up in countless articles,
    often outside of technology-minded publications. We’re promised a future of intelligent
    chatbots, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants — a future sometimes painted
    in a grim light and other times as utopian, where human jobs will be scarce and
    most economic activity will be handled by robots or AI agents. For a practitioner
    of machine learning, it’s important to be able to recognize the signal amid the
    noise, so that you can tell world-changing developments from overhyped press releases.
    Our future is at stake, and it’s one in which you have an active role to play:
    after reading this book, you’ll be one of those who can develop these AI systems.
    So let’s tackle these questions: What has deep learning achieved so far? How significant
    is it? Where are we headed next? Should you believe the hype?'

    normally performed by humans*. As such, AI is a general field that encompasses
    machine learning and deep learning, but that also includes many more approaches
    that may not involve any learning. Consider that until the 1980s, most AI textbooks
    didn’t mention “learning” at all! Early chess programs, for instance, only involved
    hardcoded rules crafted by programmers and didn’t qualify as machine learning.
    In fact, for a fairly long time, most experts believed that human-level artificial
    intelligence could be achieved by having programmers handcraft a sufficiently
    large set of explicit rules for manipulating knowledge stored in explicit databases.
    This approach is known as *symbolic AI*. It was the dominant paradigm in AI from
    the 1950s to the late 1980s, and it reached its peak popularity during the *expert
    systems* boom of the 1980s.

    certain computations from the field of mathematical analysis — hence, the name
    Analytical Engine. As such, it was the intellectual descendant of earlier attempts
    at encoding mathematical operations in gear form, such as the Pascaline, or Leibniz’s

    from exposure to training data. Meanwhile, other approaches to machine learning

    The term *neural network* is a reference to neurobiology, but although some of
    the central concepts in deep learning were developed in part by drawing inspiration
    from our understanding of the brain (in particular, the visual cortex), deep learning
    models are not models of the brain. There’s no evidence that the brain implements
    anything like the learning mechanisms used in modern deep learning models. You
    may come across pop science articles proclaiming that deep learning works like
    the brain or is modeled after the brain, but that isn’t the case. It would be
    confusing and counterproductive for newcomers to the field to think of deep learning
    as being in any way related to neurobiology; you don’t need that shroud of “just
    like our minds” mystique and mystery, and you may as well forget anything you
    may have read about hypothetical links between deep learning and biology. For

    automates what used to be the most crucial step in a machine learning workflow:
    feature engineering. Previous machine learning techniques — shallow learning —
    only involved transforming the input data into one or two successive representation
    spaces, which wasn’t expressive enough for most problems. As such, humans had
    to go to great lengths to make the initial input data more amenable to processing
    by these methods: they had to manually engineer good representations for their
    data. This is called *feature engineering*. Deep learning, on the other hand,
    completely automates this step: with deep learning, you learn all features in
    one pass rather than having to engineer them yourself. This has greatly simplified
    machine learning workflows, often replacing sophisticated multistage pipelines

- en: It might be tempting for those new to the field to assume that it is the practical
    successes of generative AI that caused the belief in near-term AGI, but that is
    actually backward. The claims of near-term AGI came first, and they significantly
    contributed to the rise of generative AI. As early as 2013, there were fears among
    tech elites that AGI might be coming within a few years. Back then, the idea was
    that DeepMind, a London AI research startup acquired by Google, was on track to
    achieve it. This belief was the impetus behind the founding of OpenAI in 2015,
    which initially aimed to be an open source counterweight to DeepMind. OpenAI played
    a critical role in kick-starting generative AI, so in a peculiar twist, it was
    the belief in near-term AGI that fueled the ascent of generative AI, not the other
    way around. In 2016, OpenAI’s recruiting pitch was that it would achieve AGI by
    2020! To be fair, though, only a minority of people in the tech industry believed
    in such an optimistic timeline back then. By early 2023, however, a significant
    fraction of engineers in the San Francisco Bay Area seemed convinced that AGI
    would be coming within the following couple of years.

    automation” — the encoding and operationalization of human skills and knowledge.

- en: 'To be clear, cognitive automation is incredibly useful. But intelligence —
    cognitive autonomy — is a different creature altogether. Think of it this way:
    AI is like a cartoon character, while intelligence is like a living being. A cartoon,
    no matter how realistic, can only act out the scenes it was drawn for. A living
    being, on the other hand, can adapt to the unexpected.'

- en: “If the cartoon is drawn with sufficient realism and covers sufficiently many
    scenes, what’s the difference?” you may ask. If a large language model can output
    a sufficiently human-sounding answer when asked a question, does it matter if
    it possesses true cognitive autonomy? The key difference is adaptability. Intelligence
    is the ability to face the unknown, adapt to it, and learn from it. Automation,
    even at its best, can only handle situations it’s been trained on or programmed
    for. That’s why creating robust automation is so challenging — it requires accounting
    for every possible scenario.

    This has happened before. Twice in the past, AI went through a cycle of intense
    optimism followed by disappointment and skepticism, with a dearth of funding as
    a result. It started with symbolic AI in the 1960s. In those early days, projections
    about AI were flying high. One of the best-known pioneers and proponents of the
    symbolic AI approach was Marvin Minsky, who claimed in 1967, “Within a generation
    . . . the problem of creating ‘artificial intelligence’ will substantially be
    solved.” Three years later, in 1970, he made a more precisely quantified prediction:
    “In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence
    of an average human being.” In 2025, such an achievement still appears to be far
    in the future — so far that we have no way to predict how long it will take —
    but in the 1960s and early 1970s, several experts believed it to be right around
    the corner (as do many people today). A few years later, as these high expectations
    failed to materialize, researchers and government funds turned away from the field,
    marking the start of the first *AI winter* (a reference to a nuclear winter, because
    this was shortly after the height of the Cold War).'

  zh: 过度膨胀的短期期望的危险在于，当技术不可避免地未能达到预期时，研究投资可能会枯竭，长时间地减缓进步。这种情况以前发生过。在过去，人工智能经历了两次高度乐观随后是失望和怀疑的周期，结果是资金短缺。这一切始于20世纪60年代的符号人工智能。在那些早期日子里，对人工智能的预测很高。符号人工智能方法最著名的先驱和倡导者之一是马文·明斯基，他在1967年声称：“在一代人之内……创造‘人工智能’的问题将基本得到解决。”三年后，在1970年，他做出了一个更精确的预测：“在三到八年之内，我们将拥有一个具有普通人类一般智能的机器。”到2025年，这样的成就似乎仍然遥不可及——如此遥远以至于我们无法预测它需要多长时间——但在20世纪60年代和早期70年代，一些专家认为它就在眼前（正如今天许多人所认为的那样）。几年后，随着这些高期望未能实现，研究人员和政府资金开始远离这个领域，标志着第一次**人工智能寒冬**（这个术语是参照核冬天而来的，因为这是冷战高潮之后不久）的开始。
- en: It wouldn’t be the last one. In the 1980s, a new take on symbolic AI, *expert
    systems*, started gathering steam among large companies. A few initial success
    stories triggered a wave of investment, with corporations around the world starting
    their own in-house AI departments to develop expert systems. Around 1985, companies
    were spending over $1 billion each year on the technology; but by the early 1990s,
    these systems had proven expensive to maintain, difficult to scale, and limited
    in scope, and interest died down. Thus began the second AI winter. We may be currently

    AI research like we saw in the 1990s. If there is a winter, it should be very

    inevitable that some air will need to be let out of the 2023–2024 AI bubble. Currently,
    AI investment, primarily in data centers and GPUs, surpasses $100 billion annually,
    while revenue generation lags significantly, closer to $10 billion. AI is currently
    being judged by executives and investors not by what it has accomplished, but
    by what we are told it might soon become able to do — much of which will durably
