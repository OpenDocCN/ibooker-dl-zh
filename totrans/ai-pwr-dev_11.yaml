    from an afterthought to being integral to a project’s design and implementation
    phases. Despite this elevated attention, developers often find it challenging
    to keep pace with the rapidly changing sphere of application security. This chapter
    offers a comprehensive understanding of how AI, specifically ChatGPT, can be embedded
    into various stages of the application development process to strengthen application
    security, providing a novel set of tools for building more secure software applications.

    into various stages of the application development process for the ISAM application,
    written in Python using FastAPI. We’ll discuss how this AI model can help identify
    vulnerabilities, contribute to threat modeling, assess application design for
    potential insecurities, understand and apply security best practices.

    for all security concerns but rather to showcase its potential as a powerful tool
    in the developer’s security toolkit. We will learn how to proactively identify
    and manage threats, keeping in mind the holistic goal of creating not just functional
    software but secure software. In this journey, we will navigate topics such as
    modeling threats, incorporating security in the development lifecycle, the role
    of AI in security, and much more. Let’s get started!

    is often treated as such. Generative AIs are tools that can be used to assess
    and improve the security of your application, but they will not replace input
    from a security expert, nor will they make you one. For more information on designing
    secure applications, refer to *Secure by Design* by Dan Bergh Johnsson, Daniel
    Deogun, and Daniel Sawano (Manning, 2019; [www.manning.com/books/secure-by-design](https://www.manning.com/books/secure-by-design)).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Threat modeling is a structured approach that helps teams understand, prioritize,
    and manage potential threats in a system. By simulating the mindset of an attacker,
    threat modeling systematically identifies vulnerabilities, evaluates the potential
    effect, and determines mitigation strategies. Rooted in the design phase but relevant
    throughout the entire software development lifecycle, threat modeling acts as
    a crucial bridge between high-level security policies and on-the-ground practices.
  prefs: []

    your system and the external environment change, so you must revisit and update

    to understand why we would want to do this in the first place. With a greater
    emphasis on security in today’s development landscape, we must be mindful of factors
    that have significantly reshaped how software is developed, deployed, and accessed.
    As more services go digital, there’s a broader attack surface. Everything from
    online banking to health records, e-commerce, and even government services is
    now available online, making them potential targets.

    and attackers are continually devising new methods. The danger has never been
    more significant, with the rise of state-sponsored attacks, ransomware, and cyber
    espionage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    commonly utilize microservices, third-party APIs, and cloud infrastructures. This
    complexity can introduce multiple potential points of vulnerability. Systems are
    not standalone but interconnected with other systems, creating a domino effect.
    A breach in one can provide a stepping-stone to compromise others.

    harm a company’s reputation, lead to legal consequences, and result in a loss
    of customers or business opportunities. Further, with regulations like the General
    Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy
    Act (CCPA) in the United States, organizations have an increased responsibility
    to protect user data. Noncompliance can result in substantial penalties.

    mitigation techniques. ChatGPT has an extensive knowledge base of basic cybersecurity
    concepts; it can define standard terms and explain complex attack vectors to you
    in whatever level of detail is appropriate to your cybersecurity journey. You
    can begin by asking it to explain cybersecurity principles, what a SQL injection
    attack is (but not how to perform one!), or what clickjacking is.

    it. The primary objective of SAST is to find security vulnerabilities early in
    the development process by analyzing the codebase and identifying patterns or
    code segments that may lead to security breaches. This approach allows developers
    to address vulnerabilities before the application is even run, enabling the detection
    of problems that may be missed during runtime or dynamic testing. SAST tools can

- en: Dynamic application security testing (DAST) is a testing process that identifies
    security vulnerabilities while the application is running, typically from the
    perspective of an external attacker. Unlike SAST, which analyzes source code,
    bytecode, or binary code, DAST evaluates the application in its runtime environment.
    This approach can identify vulnerabilities that are not apparent in the code but
    emerge during its execution, such as problems related to authentication, session
    management, data validation, and other runtime concerns. DAST tools often operate
    by simulating attacks on a running application and monitoring its responses, making
    them especially useful for detecting vulnerabilities that can be exploited during
    real-world attacks.

    it is being transmitted)—can pose significant risks if not protected. Unencrypted
    data can be easily accessed and read by unauthorized individuals, making it a
    prime target for cybercriminals. If malicious actors gain access to systems or
    networks storing this data, they can extract valuable information without any
    barriers.

    can result in massive financial losses, both from the theft itself and from potential
    lawsuits or fines from regulatory bodies. Many regions and sectors have stringent
    data protection regulations. Noncompliance, such as failing to encrypt sensitive
    data, can result in heavy fines and legal actions. As mentioned earlier, the GDPR
    in the EU and CCPA in California are notable examples.

    parties. This can lead to misinformation, data corruption, or malicious actions
    like poisoning a dataset. Data breaches resulting from unencrypted data can severely
    harm an organization’s reputation, leading to a loss of trust from customers,
    clients, and partners.

    it’s not a silver bullet. Effective data security requires a multilayered approach,
    including access controls, regular security audits, secure backups, and user education,
    among other measures.

    around the world. One such recent and infamous real-world incident, the result
    of a failure to properly secure data, was the Ashley Madison breach in 2015\.
    This breach of the popular dating site resulted in the release of user data for
    37 million users, including real names, addresses, and more. It led to widespread
    personal and professional repercussions for its users, several lawsuits, and significant
    damage to the company’s image.

    essential to be aware of associated trade-offs such as potential performance effects,
    added complexities, and management overheads. For example, there will be additional
    computational overhead. Encryption and decryption processes require computational
    resources. Especially for algorithms that provide higher security, the computational
    cost can be significant. You need to factor this into your capacity planning.'

    operations, such as streaming services and voice communications, may experience
