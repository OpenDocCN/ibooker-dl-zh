- en: The TensorFlow ecosystem has evolved into many different frameworks to serve
    a variety of roles and functions. That flexibility is part of the reason for its
    widespread adoption, but it also complicates the learning curve for data scientists,
    machine learning (ML) engineers, and other technical stakeholders. There are so
    many ways to manage TensorFlow models for common tasks—such as data and feature
    engineering, data ingestions, model selection, training patterns, cross validation
    against overfitting, and deployment strategies—that the choices can be overwhelming.

- en: This pocket reference will help you make choices about how to do your work with
    TensorFlow, including how to set up common data science and ML workflows using
    TensorFlow 2.0 design patterns in Python. Examples describe and demonstrate TensorFlow
    coding patterns and other tasks you are likely to encounter frequently in the
    course of your ML project work. You can use it as both a how-to book and a reference.

- en: This book is intended for current and potential ML engineers, data scientists,
    and enterprise ML solution architects who want to advance their knowledge and
    experience in reusable patterns and best practices in TensorFlow modeling. Perhaps
    you’ve already read an introductory TensorFlow book, and you stay up to date with
    the field of data science generally. This book assumes that you have hands-on
    experience using Python (and possibly NumPy, pandas, and JSON libraries) for data
    engineering, feature engineering routines, and building TensorFlow models. Experience
    with common data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and NumPy arrays will
    also be very helpful.
