<h1><span class="label">Chapter 1. </span>+AI to AI+: Generative AI and the “Netscape Moment”</h1>

<p>The title of this chapter<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="generative AI (GenAI)" data-secondary="Netscape moment" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_generativeAIGenAINetscapemoment1335"/> may have caught you a bit off guard—after all, Netscape came out in 1994, and we’re writing this book in 2025! In this chapter, we’ll tell you what we mean by equating generative AI (GenAI) to a “Netscape moment,” and then we’ll lightly touch on a wide range of topics, from how the technology works to things to keep in mind as you plan your GenAI journey.</p>

<p>Our publishers told us not to make the first chapter too long, but we’ve gone a different route. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="business considerations" data-secondary="GenAI’s contributions" data-see="use cases" data-type="indexterm" id="id281"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="GenAI" data-see="generative AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id282"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="skilling" data-secondary="skills program levers" data-see="levers of clever" data-type="indexterm" id="id283"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="jobs in GenAI" data-see="skilling" data-type="indexterm" id="id284"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="employee management in GenAI" data-see="skilling" data-type="indexterm" id="id285"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="leadership" data-secondary="skill development" data-see="skilling" data-type="indexterm" id="id286"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="models" data-secondary="SLMs" data-see="small language models" data-type="indexterm" id="id287"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="enterprise data, customizing open source for" data-see="data representations" data-type="indexterm" id="id288"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMs (large language models)" data-see="large language models" data-type="indexterm" id="id289"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="models" data-secondary="LLMs" data-see="large language models" data-type="indexterm" id="id290"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="spending money to save money" data-see="shifting left" data-type="indexterm" id="id291"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="business considerations" data-secondary="governance" data-see="governance" data-type="indexterm" id="id292"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="business considerations" data-secondary="productivity" data-see="productivity" data-type="indexterm" id="id293"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="business considerations" data-secondary="legal" data-see="legal considerations" data-type="indexterm" id="id294"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="persuasion equations" data-see="equations for persuasion" data-type="indexterm" id="id295"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="models" data-secondary="foundation" data-see="foundation models" data-type="indexterm" id="id296"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="privacy" data-see="security and privacy" data-type="indexterm" id="id297"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="spending money to make money" data-see="shifting right" data-type="indexterm" id="id298"/>We figure that if we give you enough things to think about, give you enough value, and teach you the things that sit in our brains that we put to work every day with customers, you’ll want to learn more. And that’s exactly what we’re doing here—it’s like a Netflix pilot episode: it’s a little longer than the episodes that follow, but the remaining episodes shorten up and narrow the focus to the topic at hand. We also did this so you don’t have to read the book linearly. For example, we might touch on how there are over a million large language models (LLMs) out there, which makes us confident in telling you that one model (no matter how popular it is or how much press it gets) <em>will not </em>rule them all. Not by a long shot. You might have a lot of enterprise data that you want to drive into your AI but not share, and that might spur you to jump to <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_using_your_data_as_a_differentiator_1740182052172518">Chapter 8</a> to learn about the LLM landscape and how to safely use your data with an AI model. Or perhaps you’ve decided that you’ll learn from our experience when we tell you that firms that build a company-wide upskilling plan will outperform those that leave the upskilling to some propeller heads and the privileged few with access to the AI. In that case, you’ll jump to <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06_skills_that_thrill_1740182050334297">Chapter 6</a> and learn what Lady Gaga and Queen Elizabeth I (think 1500s) have to do with your company’s skills plans.</p>

<p>We’re pretty confident that all of you will learn something from this chapter—be it some business insights, how LLMs and agents work, historical perspective, how the future is now (like agentic AI), or something else. With that said, let’s begin.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="What Is a “Netscape Moment”?" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch01_what_is_a_netscape_moment_1740182043983212">
<h1>What Is a “Netscape Moment”?</h1>

<p>Why do we call this moment in time a Netscape moment? (Ah, Netscape—an ancient relic of the internet that’s as familiar to our youth today as rotary phones. Young readers...it was pretty much the world’s first web browser.) Think about what happened (assuming you were around) when Netscape made its debut in 1994: the internet started to become very tangible and very personable—for everyone. Truly, the internet was taken out of the hands of just the privileged few and democratized<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="democratization of internet" data-type="indexterm" id="id299"/> for the many (though not all took advantage of it at first). Looking back, it’s evident that a democratized internet changed our world...forever. It changed the way we store data, communicate, buy, date, and even vote! So, we call this a Netscape moment (and they don’t come around that often) because at this point, the world has gotten a strong sense of what the AI opportunity is, and that’s going to lead to a heck of a lot of innovation and ideas going forward. But much like those who didn’t take advantage of the original Netscape moment, those who don’t become part of this wave of AI will fall behind and be on the wrong side of the divide. This divide will not only impact their ability to stay connected with evolving societal norms and practices, but those on the wrong side will be restricted in their access to essential services and opportunities. This Netscape moment is going to play out just like the first one did. Those who have access to AI and take advantage of it will reshape the future (just think what those who took advantage of their access to the internet and put it to work did to the taxi industry), and those who don’t take advantage of it will lose out, with hefty societal or business consequences. (The names of the original Netscape moment losers have been withheld to protect the guilty.)</p>

<p>Now, there’s a lot of talk about how GenAI and the rise of AI agents<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="agentic systems" data-type="indexterm" id="id300"/> could be world ending. What’s our opinion? We don’t think a technology has to be world ending to be world changing, and as far as world-ending technology goes...we’ll note that we humans have a history of creating things that we’ve struggled to contain and that could have destroyed our world but have helped us at the same time (for example, nuclear technology, with which we’ve created medicine, power, and bombs). We talk about this in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05_live_die_buy_or_try_much_will_be_decided_by_ai_1740182048942635">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, like most great things in life, the amazing stuff didn’t just happen. It was a bunch of little things that added up over time to create a moment that everyone noticed. The moment we are talking about here is made up of experiences, learnings, failures, and breakthroughs that have literally been decades (we’re talking over half a century) in the making. But make no mistake about it—GenAI, especially in the form of agents, will change the world. In fact, we think that it will become such an integral part of everything we do that we’ll wish we could go back in time (AI can’t do that, in case you’re wondering) and redefine the acronym <em>AI</em> to mean <em>ambient intelligence</em> as opposed<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ambient intelligence" data-type="indexterm" id="id301"/> to <em>artificial intelligence</em>. Why? Think about where you’re sitting right now, reading this book. There is likely some light around you: it’s not obtrusive, you don’t notice it, it’s in the background, and it’s assisting you as you read this page—so it’s ambient. That’s what we think AI is going to provide—ambient assistance for lots of things we do every day in business—and that’s why we are naming this moment in time a Netscape moment.</p>

<h1>AI and the Magical Moment</h1>

<p>Arthur C. Clarke<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Clarke, Arthur C." data-type="indexterm" id="id302"/> famously said<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="and magical moment" data-secondary-sortas="magical moment" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_AIartificialintelligenceandmagicalmoment11842"/>, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” And perhaps, the first time you played with GenAI it evoked a sense of magic. (Considering that one of our dads is 89, and he uses ChatGPT to write blogs, and another dad texted his child asking about DeepSeek when certain stocks tanked on its release, we’ll assume you’ve heard of GenAI.)</p>

<p>Suddenly, for the first time in history, everyone with an internet connection has—in their hands—a technology that can speak their languages, understand their requests, and produce entirely novel output. Today AI can even reason<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="reasoning models" data-type="indexterm" id="id303"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="models" data-secondary="reasoning" data-type="indexterm" id="id304"/> through problems on its own and come up with ideas to solve them—advances in reasoning models are fueling <em>agentic AI</em>, an emerging domain of GenAI.</p>

<p>AI can write poetry and draw otherworldly images based on our mere utterances of intents. AI can write and document code, and it can surprise and delight us with an original joke or musical composition. It can create—and an act of creation often inspires wonder!</p>

<p>At first, it’s hard to argue with those who feel that AI is magic—and organizations (and people) are running fast toward this magic.</p>

<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="ch01_not_so_secret_agents_1740182043983354">
<h1>Not-So-Secret Agents</h1>

<p>We’ll get into more details of AI agents<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="agentic systems" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_agenticsystems12554"/> in subsequent chapters. (We’re purposely stretching it a bit, but when you hear the term <em>agentic AI</em>, consider it a synonym for <em>AI agents</em><em>—which are powered by GenAI</em>.) But for now, think of an <em>agent</em> as a program in which the flow logic is defined and controlled by the AI (an LLM) itself. Quite simply, today, most people use AI in a task-oriented workflow (for example, to finish a code stub or summarize a document), whereas agents are goal oriented. You give an AI agent a task, and it will get it done and even plan future actions without needing your explicit guidance or intervention.</p>

<p>Working with agents requires a change in perspective: instead of designing an AI-driven app to run some specific tasks, you use an agentic approach that focuses on outcomes and objectives. An agent will try to achieve a desired outcome and will figure out on its own which tasks are necessary. For example, you might have a group of agents—such as a researcher, a blog writer, and a social media poster (notice that they reflect different personas)—kick off a piece of work to write a blog post on the effects of inflation on the housing market and accompany that with some social media posts that they write in the appropriate style for the desired target outlets. For example, a post on Instagram is more likely to involve emojis and nonbusiness language, while a LinkedIn post is typically more professional, and a post on X (is the world still tag-lining this with “formerly known as Twitter”?) is typically limited to a smaller number of characters. Producing a blog and social media posts is the outcome that the agents in this example would work together to achieve on their own. As another example, you can use agentic AI to build a plan to improve your net promoter score (NPS) by 10 points, and the agents will go about their work (and show you their reasoning) to figure out a way to achieve that goal.</p>

<p>Another great example comes from the world of self-paced education. Perhaps the target goal of an agent is to teach you Greek. The agentic view may come up with a preliminary test to see if your Greek skills go beyond yelling “Opa!” while dodging the flames from cheese that’s on fire (saganaki) with a shot of ouzo. From there, it (or another agent that’s part of a group) may work on a comprehensive learning plan and perhaps prod you along the way to keep you learning, based on what it finds are the best practices for continuity. Could you do this with an LLM the traditional way? It would be clunky, but you could, sort of: you’d prompt it, wait for a response, give it guidance, and give it input at each step. You might even invoke chain of thought (CoT) calls or start to leverage a model that does this. But agentic AI is making it autonomous.</p>

<p>Another example of agentic AI is a shopping agent. Perplexity has released an AI shopping agent that will navigate websites to locate what you’re trying to buy and even click the checkout button for you. Compare that to the workflow you currently perform when you buy something from Amazon. What’s more, Stripe (the popular payment processing service) has started allocating single-use debit cards so those agents can pay for the stuff you want without touching your banking details (or perhaps to put a hard stop on how much an agent can spend). As you can imagine, AI shopping agents have the potential to find products and deals that perhaps you can’t find on your own or at least would have to expend a lot of effort to find them <span class="keep-together">yourself</span>.</p>

<p>Now, if you’re a retailer, you may not like that. After all, what about your upsell impulse purchase offers to those human late-night shoppers, and what about the individual browsing behavior you track for personalization purposes? Surely, you don’t want to lose those things. But an agent will just look for what it’s trying to look for—it won’t have a “squirrel” moment and go down a new path like retailers count on humans to do. This happens all the time in the real world. If you live in a place where there’s a Costco, ask yourself if you’ve ever gone in for one thing and left with just that one thing. Never! You leave with a bill that’s always over a hundred dollars, even when you just went in to get some bread. Truth be told, you likely also bought a $1.50 hot dog and soda there too.</p>

<p>That’s why some other approaches to agents (like that of Anthropic’s Claude LLM<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Claude LLM" data-type="indexterm" id="id305"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Anthropic" data-type="indexterm" id="id306"/>) are training to mimic the exact steps a user would take on the interface itself (think desktop control). Taking this approach, there’s no need to access a site with special permission (to get at backdoor hooks) or in a special way that retailers will likely want to shut down if the agentic access doesn’t benefit them.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of focus on agents and agentic frameworks right now—and speculation about what developers will be able to do with them in the future. Agents represent a major breakthrough in computer science, so this space is certainly exciting, and for sure, there is some hype here, and while it’s early, it’s also promising. That said, we believe that agents have the potential to unlock the next wave of productivity gains for the enterprise—and we can already tell what you’re thinking, and you’re right: they are going to need guardrails and management too<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_agenticsystems12554" data-type="indexterm" id="id307"/>.</p>

<h2>But...AI Is <em>Not</em> Magic</h2>

<p>For centuries, electricity was thought to be the domain of sorcerers—magicians who left audiences puzzled about where it came from and how it was generated. And although Benjamin Franklin was well aware of this phenomenon when he proved the connection between electricity and lightning, he had difficulty envisioning a practical use for it back in 1752. Ironically, Franklin’s most prized invention—the lightning <span class="keep-together">rod—was</span> entirely for the purpose of avoiding electricity, rather than using it.</p>

<p>Today, we know that too many people are going to view GenAI as another magical technology and will put it to work with little understanding of <em>how</em> it actually works. Or they will view AI as special and relegate it to experts who are expected to master and dazzle us with it. But this approach to AI takes on an air of mysticism with promises of grandeur, and it tends to push AI out of the reach of mere mortals. On the contrary, we think that widespread understanding (of both the goods and the bads) of AI is what will fuel the current Netscape moment.</p>

<p>But here’s the deal: while AI is amazing, it’s definitely not magic. Trust us. We played a round of golf with putters and drivers all “designed by AI,” and all but one of us still sliced the ball something fierce and missed a lot of 2-foot putts for $1 bets. If AI were magic, then that game would have had much lower scores and fewer Greek words that certainly don’t translate into English as “What a beautiful day. I’m great at golf.”</p>

<p>Let’s be clear: all AI does is connect data points<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="connection of data points to reach conclusions" data-type="indexterm" id="id308"/> (and come to conclusions, irrespective of moral consequences...but we’ll get into that later in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05_live_die_buy_or_try_much_will_be_decided_by_ai_1740182048942635">Chapter 5</a>). And just how does it connect data points? It does it by using math and science. The simplest way to explain it is to say that AI is just trying to guess a number that represents something (which we call a <em>vector</em>) by using clues given to it from previous numbers (which we call <em>vector sequences</em>). Yes, that’s right. If you’re using AI for visual recognition, it’s likely looking at a set of numbers—typically, three groups of them, representing red, green, and blue (RGB)—with shading intensities on a scale of 0 to 255. If you have a 16-MHz voice recording, it means you have 16,000 numbers per second that represent different components of sound (like displacement and amplitude). If you type the sentence, “Don’t cry over spilled milk,” into an AI, it reads it as something like {16357, 956, 16106, 927, 74125, 14403} and really has no idea what milk is, let alone why you would cry over spilling it. In fact, it’d be more accurate to call an LLM—which powers many GenAI programs like ChatGPT and DeepSeek—a large number-guessing model. Perhaps better yet, you could call it a large sequence number model<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="large sequence number model, LLM as" data-type="indexterm" id="id309"/> (which is what computer nerds...er, scientists, call them)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_generativeAIGenAINetscapemoment1335" data-type="indexterm" id="id310"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_AIartificialintelligenceandmagicalmoment11842" data-type="indexterm" id="id311"/>.</p>

<h1>Moving Your Business from +AI to AI+</h1>

<p>Let’s step back<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="generative AI (GenAI)" data-secondary="moving business from +AI to AI+" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_generativeAIGenAImovingbusinessfromx2bAItoAIx2b14427"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="business considerations" data-secondary="moving from +AI to AI+" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_businessconsiderationsmovingfromx2bAItoAIx2b14427"/> to first understand the <em>why</em> of this moment<a contenteditable="false" data-primary=" +AI to AI+" data-primary-sortas="AI to AI transition for mental model" data-secondary="transition for mental model" data-type="indexterm" id="id312"/>. Why is this moment so big? To many, it’s the amazing things that AI can now do. Certainly, we’ve seen it do amazing things, but we’ve been around AI—and technology, for that matter—for a while. Amazing stuff happens a lot. Look at that TV hanging on your wall. Is it thinner than the one you had three years ago and the one you had five years before that? What about the number of cameras on your smart phone—more or fewer? And what about the amount of storage on your computer, the number of streaming services you have, and the check-in experience for your flight? We <em>expect</em> technology to get better all the time, and certainly, if you look at successive generations of any LLM or non-AI technology, stuff gets more and more amazing over time. But one thing not to be missed in this Netscape moment is the set of superpowers brought to us by prompts<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="prompts" data-secondary="power of for non-techies" data-type="indexterm" id="id313"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="completion" data-type="indexterm" id="id314"/>. A <em>prompt</em> is what we give to an LLM, and a <em>completion</em> is what the LLM returns. The prompt has literally given non-techies superpowers. How so? In the past, you had a shot at giving yourself a productivity boost, <em>but only if</em> you were code and data <span class="keep-together">savvy—but</span> today, all of us<em> </em>can interact with AI in the same natural way we do with our human colleagues.</p>

<p>The question is, will you take advantage of it? We’re certain you <em>want </em>to take advantage of this business once-in-a-lifetime opportunity (because you’re reading this book). But an even bigger question is, <em>will</em> you be able to take advantage of it? You need a business framework that allows you to execute on your vision (the remainder of this chapter will help you do that), knowledge of how LLMs work, an upskilling plan, and knowledge about what can go right <em>and</em> what can go wrong. All of this is covered in this book.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Imagine this: you’re sitting at your desk, and you ask (prompt) an AI to do some work for you. You ask it to open a purchase order, give sentiment as to the sales outlook for the current quarter, procure materials for a new product—or, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_1_1740182043962270">Figure 1-1</a>, list all the new job requisitions for your 30,000-person company.

<h1>Before You Do Anything, Change Your Mental Model from +AI to AI+</h1>

<p>What do we mean by <em>w</em><em>ill you take advantage of it?</em> Today, most organizations are going about their business with their traditional technology strategy. They’re saying, “Hey, let’s do some AI as well!” This is the world of<em> +AI</em>, which typically means adding AI to existing business processes. (Spoiler alert: this isn’t the mode you want to be in.) And while in the last five years adoption of AI has doubled, most organizations still have a +AI mentality.</p>

<p>We are moving from the world of +AI to <em>AI+</em>, which means <em>AI first</em>. And a decade from now, the companies that adopt an AI+ mentality today—in terms of how they’re training their people and how they’re putting AI and technology into production—will be the winners of today’s Netscape moment, just like the early adopters of the internet were the winners of the original Netscape moment. So<em> </em>we’re telling you this right now:<em> if you’re content to sit on your +AI mindset, things aren’t going to go well for your business (or you personally) because you will lack the agility and capability that come with the next generation of </em><em>AI</em><em>.</em></p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch01_figure_2_1740182043962325"><img src="assets/aivc_01in01.png"/></div></figure>

<p>To get to AI+, you have to break down your business workflows into granular discrete components, then see where AI can take over (it’s typically the rote work), and build the human part of the workflow on top of it.</p>

<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="ch01_what_s_in_a_name_foundation_models_are_where_you_s_1740182043983616">
<h1>What’s in a Name—Foundation Models Are Where You Start</h1>

<p>Everybody’s heard about ChatGPT or DeepSeek—they’ve both created a heck of a lot of interest<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="foundation models (FMs)" data-seealso="large language models" data-type="indexterm" id="id315"/> and have certainly brought the domain of AI to everyone’s attention. But we find people get lost in the terminology, so to at least help you sound cool in front of your significant other (meaning correcting them when they’re wrong, because that’s always helpful in a relationship), let’s spend a quick moment on these terms that we will flesh out later in this book. For now, know that all your GenAI will start out with some sort of foundation model and will end up under the umbrella of GenAI inputs producing outputs.</p>

<p>ChatGPT, Granite<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Granite" data-type="indexterm" id="id316"/>, DeepSeek, Llama, and more are all LLMs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-type="indexterm" id="id317"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="IBM" data-secondary="Granite" data-type="indexterm" id="id318"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="DeepSeek" data-type="indexterm" id="id319"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Llama" data-type="indexterm" id="id320"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenAI" data-secondary="ChatGPT" data-type="indexterm" id="id321"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Meta" data-secondary="Llama" data-type="indexterm" id="id322"/>, but an LLM is just a type of <em>foundation model</em> (FM). Work on FMs started with a seminal paper<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch01.html#id323" id="id323-marker">1</a></sup> out of Stanford University a few years ago. One other thing we want to point out is that “language” can be anything—we use specific languages for coding, and we use a certain language around molecules, so don’t get caught up in the notion that LLMs are just about languages that we use to speak and write to each other. If you squint just enough, you’ll see that everything is associated with a language (coding, communication, molecular properties—everything).</p>

<p>The beauty of FMs (and their LLM offspring) is that they can easily be adapted to perform downstream tasks for which they were never originally designed (again, it’s more math than magic, but it’s cool).

<section data-pdf-bookmark="The AI Ladder, Rebooted for GenAI" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch01_the_ai_ladder_rebooted_for_genai_1740182043983774">
<h2>The AI Ladder, Rebooted for GenAI</h2>

<p>What does this all mean in terms of how you’ll go about adopting GenAI and agents in your organization? A few years ago, two of us wrote a book called <em>The AI Ladder</em> (O’Reilly), in which we introduced the framework you see in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_4_1740182043962382">Figure 1-2</a>. That book focused on data as the path to AI through an information architecture (IA)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="information architecture (IA)" data-type="indexterm" id="id326"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="IA (information architecture)" data-type="indexterm" id="id327"/>. We think this point of view accurately reflected how AI was done at the time—humans collecting, organizing, and labeling datasets for supervised training. (Things changed with the invention<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="transformers" data-type="indexterm" id="id328"/> of the <em>transformer</em>, which to many was the inception of GenAI.) We felt that the AI Ladder was a perfect analogy because it wasn’t just about technology—it also embodied the vendors you chose to work with and the skills gaps you were trying to bridge in your companies.</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch01_figure_4_1740182043962382"><img alt="A blue rectangular object with black text  Description automatically generated" src="assets/aivc_0102.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 1-2. </span>The AI Ladder: a traditional (pregenerative) AI guiding strategy that organizations could use to transform their business by connecting trusted data to AI</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>As <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_4_1740182043962382">Figure 1-2</a> shows, back then, data operations made up most of the AI Ladder. And rightfully so, because organizations were struggling to get their hands around their data back then (they still are today) and wanted to get some AI added to their existing business processes (they had a +AI mindset back then).</p>

<p>Now, step back and think about the ground (the foundation) a ladder sits on that you’re about to climb. If it’s solid, you’ll have more confidence climbing it. Even better, if someone (like a trusted technology partner) is holding that ladder, you will certainly climb it higher, faster, and with even more confidence. None of that goes away with GenAI and agents, and that’s why we decided to reboot the AI Ladder for this AI moment (see <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_5_1740182043962404">Figure 1-3</a>).</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch01_figure_5_1740182043962404"><img alt="A blue rectangular box with white text  Description automatically generated" src="assets/aivc_0103.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 1-3. </span>The AI Ladder rebooted for GenAI</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>From the first rung, our reframed modern-day AI Ladder is built with AI in mind, not the destination<a contenteditable="false" data-primary=" +AI to AI+" data-primary-sortas="AI to AI transition for mental model" data-secondary="transition for mental model" data-type="indexterm" id="id329"/>! What does that mean? Well, there’s a rung (the first one) that’s still really focused on data. Notice in this reboot that we’ve collapsed several rungs from the original AI Ladder in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_4_1740182043962382">Figure 1-2</a>? We’ve also added a slight tweak to ensure you don’t miss an important component of your ultimate success with GenAI: your ability to collect, organize, protect, and govern data (and more) is your <em>information architecture—</em>which should be infused with AI to help it along. IA is so important to AI+ that we decided to put our advice in a font size so big that you won’t miss it (in case you’re skimming this chapter), so don’t feel like we’re yelling this at you (though we probably are).</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch01_figure_6_1740182043962427"><img src="assets/aivc_01in03.png"/></div></figure>

<p>What doesn’t change? You <em>still </em>need (even more so now than before) an IA platform<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="information architecture (IA)" data-type="indexterm" id="id330"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="IA (information architecture)" data-type="indexterm" id="id331"/> that lets you collect, organize, integrate, transform, apply data intelligence, and store data. In fact, while you needed such a platform to become a +AI business, you’ll need it <em>even more</em> to become an AI+ business.</p>

<p>Why is an IA so important? You’ll learn more and more throughout this book that to get the most benefit out of this Netscape moment, you’ll leverage your data to steer your models. To do that properly (such that it not only performs but is trusted and explainable), you will come to appreciate how an IA is going to turbocharge your efforts when you really put AI to work for your business and tasks that you will eventually have agents do on your behalf.</p>

<p>The new rungs help organizations learn how to add AI to their applications. They guide you in how to automate your workflows and replace existing workflows with agentic workflows. After all, the problem in the past was that people put AI on top of existing workflows (which made sense because they were operating in a +AI model). But the real value—the kind that makes your bosses actually say, “Amazing work!”—will come when you reimagine new workflows that make you look back and ask, “Why did we ever do it this way?” That’s what AI+ is all about! And by the time you get to the top rung (what this book is designed to help you do), you’ll be letting AI do the work it is well suited to do. You’ll be AI+. AI will do the (rote) work, and we like the sound of that. This Netscape moment is truly going to change how business gets done.</p>

<p>We encourage you to really spend some time looking at this new AI Ladder, and while you’re doing that, think about your core business processes and how you’re doing this today. Where are you on the +AI to AI+ spectrum? Do you even have your hands around your data, let alone be ready to put it to work? Have you started to do some automation? Again, the technology is available for you to do anything on this rebooted AI Ladder, but it’s on you to take advantage of it<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_AILadder171250" data-type="indexterm" id="id332"/>.</p>

<h1>Before You Start Your Journey, Classify the Budget and Identify How AI Is Going to Help</h1>

<p>Before you even start thinking about a GenAI project<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="generative AI (GenAI)" data-secondary="budget classification" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_generativeAIGenAIbudgetclassification19964"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="generative AI (GenAI)" data-secondary="AI contribution analysis" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_generativeAIGenAIAIcontributionanalysis19964"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="business considerations" data-secondary="AI usage analysis" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_businessconsiderationsAIusageanalysis19964"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="business analysis for AI use" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_AIartificialintelligencebusinessanalysisforAIuse19964"/> (or any IT project, for that matter), we thought it’d be a good idea to share some sound advice that’s best embodied by a quote from Thomas Edison<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Edison, Thomas" data-type="indexterm" id="id333"/>: “Vision without execution is hallucination.”</p>

<p>Just like (as you will find out) today’s models can hallucinate and confabulate, your plans to transform from a +AI business to an AI+ business will be nothing short of fantasy without well-documented priorities and strong execution skills. Trust us on this; we’ve either been involved (and have the scar tissue to prove it) or seen big ideas jump off the peak of the hype curve and plummet to their demise. (A great example are those data lakes during the Hadoop phase, which share an unfortunate common denominator with Humpty Dumpty.)</p>

<p>Our advice? It doesn’t matter whom (vendor or colleague) you’re talking to—get them to classify whatever project they’re proposing across two dimensions: what they’re spending the money for and the category of AI that’s going to help the business.</p>

<p>Sure, there are lots of dimensions that we could have shared with you, but we wanted something you could KISS (keep it simple, silly—although others use a different word for that last <em>S</em>). You don’t need some complex formula, but at the end of the day, our (shockingly) simple advice will almost guarantee that you will not fall into the “AI project” trap so many businesses fall into when deep technical teams are looking for project funding for the latest technology trend. You need to focus on the business value/aspect value of your projects, <em>not </em>on the technical aspects.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Dimension One: Spend Money to Save Money, or Spend Money to Make Money? How Will AI Help Your Business?" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch01_dimension_one_spend_money_to_save_money_or_spend_1740182043983908">
<h2>Dimension One: Spend Money to Save Money, or Spend Money to Make Money? How Will AI Help Your Business?</h2>

<p>There are many ways to spend budget<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="shifting left" data-type="indexterm" id="id334"/>, but when you get right down to it, every day leaders wake up with entrusted budgets and have to decide to either spend money to save money or spend money to make money. (Adjust for your industry; for example, in healthcare, think of spending money to save lives as another spend category.) When you spend money to save it, you’re <em>renovating</em>, and when you spend it to make it, you’re <em>innovating</em>.</p>

<p>We’d be remiss if we didn’t explicitly note that it’d be fair to say that some use cases are going to renovate and innovate at the same time—but remember to KISS it. If your use case is going to do both, why not break it down using the same approach used for microservices and modern application architectures? These smaller phased components get you quicker wins and more focus—once you finish Phase 1 of the use case (save money), go to Phase 2 (make money). For example, we talked to a company that moves 30 million pounds of potatoes across a value chain, trying to stay relevant in a world of automated systems. When they came to us, about 50% of their facility was high tech and about 50% was low tech. They had a challenging issue because a potato wart infestation devastated the exportability of some of their yields. Potato warts pose no threat to human health or food safety, but they do have an economic impact on potato growers because they make the product unmarketable in the grading process (and even banned in certain countries). The movement to invest in technology to identify and better wash “warty” potatoes (just writing it that way makes them sound way worse than they are) would allow this company to better process its potatoes. That movement resulted in big savings over its original plan to expand (scarce) labor for more manual inspections and washing. Using budget from a spend money to save money (labor) savings approach created surplus budget to deploy those dollars (by using renovation to fund innovation) into reestablishing export relationships for some potatoes (with the veracity of the AI-assisted inspection and washing process) and finding secondary markets for other potatoes. This also had the benefit of reducing the amount of food waste that resulted from the export controls (in a world that is short of food).</p>

<p>Step back for a moment and think about the initiatives your company is journeying on right now. The projects you personally are responsible for and even the ones you’re trying to sell or gain sponsorship for—you can boil them all down to this simple framework.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Dimension Two: Categorize How the AI Helps Your Business" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch01_dimension_two_categorize_how_the_ai_helps_your_bu_1740182043983968">
<h2>Dimension Two: Categorize How the AI Helps Your Business</h2>

<p>Once you’ve figured out the kind of budget dollars<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="renovation versus innovation with AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id335"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="renovation versus innovation with AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id336"/> you’re spending—renovation or innovation—the next step is to categorize your project in one of three ways in which AI can help your business: automation, optimization, or prediction.</p>

<p>This framework isn’t perfect, but it’s powerful and pretty simple. Let’s try it out with some examples:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Automation: spending money to save money</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>“I want to use AI to summarize an internal help desk<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="automation" data-secondary="as use case for AI" data-secondary-sortas="use case for AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id337"/> ticketing system and automatically route it to the appropriate department for action, based on what the AI understands about the subject and severity of the ticket.” Spice this up with agentic AI that could go through all these tickets, evaluate trending issues and even the performance of the people handling them, then automatically generate reports and action plans.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Optimization: spending money to save money</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>“I want to use AI to deliver<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="optimization use case for AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id338"/> highly personalized (not just in text and tone, but in the modality of delivery, time of delivery, and so on) outreach messages to support our sales campaigns.” Spice this up with agentic AI that researches the best modality and time combinations to reach out to cohorts like seniors, working professionals, teachers, and yes—even Swifties.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Prediction: spending money to make money</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>“I want to <em>nowcast</em><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="prediction use case for AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id339"/> (not forecast) which products are likely to sell out and which are likely to underperform (using point-of-sale systems data), and I want to discount underperformers earlier in the selling season so I don’t have to make drastic reductions at the end of a sales cycle when I still have lots of stock.” Spice this up with agentic AI by having AI research trend lines that have high geographic granularities using weather predictions that perhaps effect this particular class of inventories.</p>

<h2>Use an Acumen Curve to Visualize How AI Helps Your Business</h2>

<p>We think it’s a great idea to visualize the dimensional decisions<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="acumen curve, business value to AI" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_acumencurvebusinessvaluetoAI113079"/> you make because it will make it easier for you to see the aggregate view of AI investments across your company and communicate them as well. You can come up with your own version and labels, but <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_7_1740182043962447">Figure 1-4</a> shows ones we like to use for AI and data projects.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>We want you to think of data in terms of your <em>acumen</em>, which means your skills related to putting data to work to help your business become data driven. Why? Because even if you have lots of data (hint: you do), it’s not much use to you unless you know how to put it to work. That’s the acumen part, and gaining acumen is exactly what this book is here to help you do. Be forewarned: the landscape of data acumen is ever-changing. We like to tell people to think of their data and data acumen like a gym membership, for two reasons. First, if you don’t use it, you’ll get nothing out of it. Second, if you stop using it, you’ll start to lose whatever gains you worked hard to achieve.</p>
</div>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 1-4. </span>An AI and Data Acumen Curve</h6>
</div></figure>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_7_1740182043962447">Figure 1-4</a> gives an example of a <em>Data Acumen </em><em>C</em><em>urve</em>, which is a terrific asset<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Data Acumen Curve" data-type="indexterm" id="id340"/> to include in any strategic AI project planning meeting. We built this specific Data Acumen Curve for an agriculture client when fate somehow brought us all together to work on the same project, and we got along well. (If we hadn’t, you likely wouldn’t be reading this book.) The y-axis is simple: it represents value.</p>

<p>As you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_7_1740182043962447">Figure 1-4</a>, we applied several dimensions to the x-axis. First, we divided the budget landscape into four quadrants (it can be any number you want and your names might be different), which gave our client a good visual tool (and the agility) to take the dozens of AI-based use cases we would eventually talk about and tack them onto this whiteboard. Meanwhile, we coplanned this client’s AI strategy with an unrelenting focus on business strategy.</p>

<p>At the bottom of each quadrant, we labeled what the investment would do: reduce costs, modernize the business, make the business more insights driven with respect to decision making, or the ability of the investment to transform the business. Finally, at the very bottom, you can see the emergence of a natural border (it should be a friendly one) between renovating and innovating. This is important to understand because, again, you should make plans to derive downstream innovation benefits from the excess budget for any renovation project.</p>

<p>When all was said and done, we had something that looked like <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_8_1740182043962474">Figure 1-5</a>. It gave the project team supreme clarity on what they would and would not do and the ability to easily communicate any project benefits to stakeholders.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 1-5. </span>Results of an agricultural client’s use case AI and Data Acumen Curve</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Before moving on, we want to give you some other thoughts as you think about what your business projects would look like transposed onto <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_8_1740182043962474">Figure 1-5</a>. First, if you want to start in the “safest” place, that’s automation and spending money to save money (cost reduction). But we’ll caution you: if that’s where you leave things, the <em>long </em>value returned won’t be enormous. Don’t get us wrong, smart cost cutting is a terrific strategy and can free up investment budget and help fuel the top line, but it can’t be the end of your AI conversation, or you’ll miss out on the far right side of this model. We say this despite so many being forced to budget as if the conversation were only about cost savings. That’s why we make this promise: nowhere in this book will you hear us tell you to do more with less—that’s so early 2000s.</p>

<p>Take governance<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="governance" data-secondary="in business use of GenAI" data-type="indexterm" id="id341"/>, for example. Most organizations scurry to implement regulatory compliance with the least possible work-to-comply approach. Their measured objectives and key results (OKRs) is the avoidance of fines (cost savings). However, this approach misses the opportunity to create regulatory dividends from those compliance investments (data intelligence for better explaining your LLM’s output to an auditor, for example) to accelerate your AI strategy. We’ve seen <em>way </em>too many data governance projects that end up shortchanging the real value to the business, and in a GenAI and agentic world, that’s going to be costly (more on that later in this book).</p>

<p>Second, take note of the curve back in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_7_1740182043962447">Figure 1-4</a>. As you move more to the right in this framework, the value created for your business increases. That’s partly because you are doing things “differently” (you’re AI+ as opposed to +AI) and also because you have mastered applying AI to cost savings and you’re now modernizing your processes. As the world exited the isolation (COVID) economy, there were companies that bent <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_7_1740182043962447">Figure 1-4</a>’s value curve in their favor and those that stayed on the lower overall yield side of it and are still there today. For example, one United States‒based craft store implemented curbside pickup within days of having to shut down access to its brick-and-mortar stores, while to this day, a very well-known large retailer is still trying to decisively connect its physical store inventories with its online ordering system. Indeed, the pandemic forced companies to pack 5 to 10 years of modernization into 1 year, and some did it well and some didn’t.</p>

<p>Look at some of the innovation<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="innovation use cases" data-type="indexterm" id="id342"/> use cases plotted in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_8_1740182043962474">Figure 1-5</a>. Those required a certain amount of rethinking around business models and workflows so this client could fully embrace the opportunities presented to it by an innovation investment. But be forewarned, you’ll miss out on the full gamut of potential benefits if your definition of the finish line is putting all your transformative innovations on top of existing business models and workflows, using the +AI model. You should be thinking and planning about how these models and workflows could (or should) change because you’re using GenAI and agents to become AI+. We can’t stress enough how important this is. As you build your own Acumen Curves, reimagine your business processes with your newfound super powers in mind—because we guarantee businesses operating in an AI+ model will outperform those operating in a +AI model.</p>

<p>Finally, you can use AI in all of the value quadrants in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_8_1740182043962474">Figure 1-5</a>, so while the value curve steepens (yield more) as you move to the right, you can apply the technology wherever you want. For example, you can use agentic AI for cost reduction but you can also use it for transformation. Getting back to our earlier agent example, imagine creating a crew of agents that go over your ticketing system, collectively perform the following steps, and come back with a report that can help you boost your NPS:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Go over a series of data from support tickets.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Generate suggestions for improvements based on that data.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Organize this data into a table, in groupings that make sense.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Make charts out of this data so you can visualize any trends.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Wrap things up by running a full final report on this analysis that gives information like the number of tickets a human support specialist handles, the average resolution time, overall customer satisfaction, problem areas, and more<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_acumencurvebusinessvaluetoAI113079" data-type="indexterm" id="id343"/>.</p>

<h2>Where to Start? Here’s Our Helpful Advice</h2>

<p>Where to start a GenAI project is the question every business will soon have to answer. And while we’ve given you some great advice on how you can ensure any investments your company makes will be linked to business value outcomes, this specific question still needs answering. Ultimately, your business environment, industry, executive priorities, and strategic goals are going to lead you to pick a use case from your now classified options. However, we do have a piece of advice that has resonated with those clients we’ve been working with who are just getting started. If you’re concerned about GenAI, agents, or how to safely deploy GenAI and agents, remember what we said earlier, choose a low risk, internal automation and a spend money to save money use case. You might want to start with GenAI before adding in agents. Either way, you will get lots of experience with all aspects of GenAI, including agents, with this approach.</p>

<p>We’ll tap into an American baseball analogy to explain this.<sup> </sup>(To appeal to our worldwide audience, we were going to use a cricket example. After all, a six is like a home run in baseball...but we had a hard time understanding any sporting event that can last five days and you still don’t know who won. That said, we agree that any game that has a position called a Silly Mid must be cool and a game we’d like to play.) In baseball, some teams build their roster to hit home runs (the “long ball”). There’s no question that home runs are super exciting and the makeup of sporting news highlight reels, but there’s no proof that focusing on hitting more home runs results in more wins. But if you get a runner on base by hitting a single, you always have the potential to score. At the end of the day, home runs are fun and flashy, but without pitching, good defense, and the ability to “grind out” runs, home runs are “empty calories.” When it comes to AI, if you’re just getting started, this is your first project, and you’re in an industry where the stakes are high if something goes wrong—again, trust us, pick an internal use case and automate it. Get on first base.</p>

<p>For example, consider using AI to help employees book vacation days<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="booking vacation days use case for using agents" data-type="indexterm" id="id344"/> rather than making them log in to an overengineered, clunky human resources (HR) system. This can be as simple as fronting the system with an instant messaging platform using a natural language prompt interface that lets employees type in “I want to book March 24 to 29 off for half days.” Or it can be something impressive, like ingesting school holidays, corporate floater days, and national holidays and get the AI to generate a vacation schedule that maximizes the time spent with your family using the least amount of your vacation days. Now let your imagination run wild and take this use case to another level with agents! Anywhere on that spectrum, if something goes wrong, it’s not just easy to fix—<em>it’s quiet </em>(as in if something goes bad, it’s not for the world to see or ridicule, as has been the case with many LLM-powered hallucinating chatbot headlines in the news). The same can’t be said if your AI is given free rein to publicly respond to comments about your own service not having a good day (as, embarrassingly, a global shipping and logistics bot that was fronted with a ubiquitous GenAI model did when it told the world it gave bad customer service—it wasn’t lying, but still)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_generativeAIGenAIbudgetclassification19964" data-type="indexterm" id="id345"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_generativeAIGenAIAIcontributionanalysis19964" data-type="indexterm" id="id346"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_businessconsiderationsAIusageanalysis19964" data-type="indexterm" id="id347"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_AIartificialintelligencebusinessanalysisforAIuse19964" data-type="indexterm" id="id348"/>.</p>

<h1>Become a Shifty Business: Shift Left, and Then, <span class="keep-together">You Can Shift Right!</span></h1>

<p>There’s a popular concept in software development<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="generative AI (GenAI)" data-secondary="shifting left and shifting right" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_generativeAIGenAIshiftingleftandshiftingright117861"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="shifting left" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_shiftingleft117861"/> and manufacturing known as <em>shifting left</em>. The premise is that if you capture defects earlier in the cycle, they become much less costly than if you’d caught them downstream, when they’re in the hands of a customer. Consider this: today’s cars run on about 100 million lines of code—and to put that into perspective, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner runs on just 14 million lines of code. (We know, it shocked us too.) It’s obvious that a physical car defect requires a recall, but software code defects are super costly—especially in the auto industry. Car manufacturers must get the bugs fixed (patched), which typically requires bringing a customer into a service shop for something that they likely have no idea is even wrong with their car. Sure, over-the-air (OTA) patching is an option, but now you have to deal with a greatly expanded surface area for cyberattacks via the car’s connectivity, which could lead to phishing emails that tell customers to download a “fix” that’s actually malware, and so on. Bottom line: it’s superexpensive.</p>

<p>GenAI and agents give all companies a moment to redefine what <em>shift</em><em>ing</em><em> left</em> means and benefit from the compaction of work (or getting it right the first time, or done faster, or automated) and compressing those costs. In short, it can make you<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="productivity" data-type="indexterm" id="id349"/> super productive—and that is going to be, as you will learn in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03_equations_for_generative_ai_persuasion_1740182046765298">Chapter 3</a>, a critical accelerator for future growth and one that could awaken untapped potential at your company. But what do other shift-left moments look like? They are all about spending money to save money! In our car example, it’s simple—fix the bugs before they get deployed inside your car. But we’ve decided to widen the aperture of shifting left, so keep reading to see what we mean.</p>

<h2>Every Day, We Walk by Problems That Can Be Solved or Made Better with Technology</h2>

<p>It’s so true. Every day, we walk by problems that can be solved or made better with technology. We repeated this section’s title here because it’s a mantra we want you to start thinking about. This is why it’s so important that you read this book: we’re not just giving you the AI story, the things to look out for, what GenAI and agents can do, and how it all works—we’re giving you a thinking person’s playbook on how to put AI to work for <em>your</em> business that goes <em>way </em>beyond technology. We’re empowering you with the art of the possible and understanding how GenAI (thanks to the prompt) has democratized<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="democratization, AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id350"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="prompts" data-secondary="democratization benefit from" data-type="indexterm" id="id351"/> the relationship everyone in your company <em>can</em> have with AI—now that they can all have productivity superpowers. In short, they no longer have to walk by problems they can make better or solve with technology.</p>

<p>This authoring team has very deep experience in business and technology. (That’s code for “Some of us are getting old and have been doing this for a long time.”) We could write a whole book on the art of the possible for solving problems, and while we don’t have the space for that in this book, we’ll give you a couple of eye-popping healthcare examples that we think will change your perspective on shifting left and will have you looking at every aspect of your business in a different way: the AI+ way. When you think of shifting left, think of reducing expenses, reducing bugs, reducing injuries and increasing safety, reducing illness and saving lives, and so on. What follows are some great examples of shifting left.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Personal mobility: A fundamental human right" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch01_personal_mobility_a_fundamental_human_right_1740182043984288">
<h3>Personal mobility: A fundamental human right</h3>

<p>In Article 20 of its Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="personal mobility, right to" data-type="indexterm" id="id352"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="diabetic foot ulcer, shift-left example" data-type="indexterm" id="id353"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="healthcare examples, shift left" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_healthcareexamplesshiftleft118697"/>, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA) declared personal mobility to be a fundamental human right. Today, in the US, there are approximately 3.3 million wheelchair users, of which 45% are older than 65. What’s more, there is about to be massive growth in this segment (about 40%) due to the aging US population—and that should add about 2 million new wheelchair users every year!</p>

<p>There are tons of studies that back up the negative effects a lack of mobility has on a person’s quality of life and the detrimental effects it has on individuals who can’t move around without assistance. These include reduced feelings of self-worth and well-being, increased depression, and many other ill effects.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a huge boost to quality of life for those in need of full-time wheelchair assistance can come in the form of a mechanized wheelchair. As amazing as they are, mechanized wheelchairs do have problems, but we don’t have to keep walking by them like we’ve been doing. First, mechanized wheelchairs weigh approximately 350 pounds, which makes them mechanized wrecking balls as much as mobility aids. In fact, 20% of those using these assistance devices will experience at least one collision per year, and 11% of those 20% are sent to the hospital. That happens every year, and the damage caused by mechanized wheelchairs can be measured in shockingly significant millions of dollars. This includes damage to homes, senior care facilities, institutions, narrow-aisled stores, the operator themselves, and so much more.</p>

<p>What’s the shift-left moment here? We drive cars every day with collision avoidance systems (CASs) and sensors, and even low-priced cars have safety features like backup sensors. Why don’t mechanized wheelchairs have them too? An AI-powered system that gives owners feedback via sounds, light color changes, and vibrations can shift injuries, accidents, insurance payouts, damages, and loss of self-esteem left. Shifting left is exactly what companies like Braze Mobility are doing by instrumenting mechanized wheelchairs with car-like safety features, thus reducing hospital visits, collisions, damage to bodies and the surrounding physical environment, and insurance claims—plus boosting the confidence of wheelchair owners. That’s a lot of shifting left for something most of us walk by every day without even realizing there is a problem!</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="A diabetic foot ulcer and an episode of care" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch01_a_diabetic_foot_ulcer_and_an_episode_of_care_1740182043984349">
<h3>A diabetic foot ulcer and an episode of care</h3>

<p>Today, the US spends approximately $327 billion on diabetes care each year—and about a third of that spending is on the care and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers!</p>

<p>A patient with diabetes can get foot ulcers from the simplest of things: stubbing a toe and breaking the skin, stepping on something, or getting a blister from walking too much. These are all the results of simple, everyday accidents, and they almost always heal on their own for most of us, but for people with diabetes—it’s quite a different story.</p>

<p>These ulcers are diabetes complications that diabetics themselves often don’t notice. Why? Diabetics may have additional complications, from neuropathy (numbness in places like the foot, where they can’t feel something is “off”) to retinopathy (obstructed vision that makes it hard to inspect one’s own foot).</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>As a result of where diabetes is more prevalent, diabetic foot ulcers are linked to race and socioeconomic standing. For example, you’re three times more likely to get one if you’re a diabetic who is Black, and you’re 93% more likely to get one if you’re a diabetic who is poor. These are not medical dispositions but social ones, which are outside the scope of this book.</p>
</div>

<p>So, what happens if you get one of these ulcers? You can look forward to a thirtyfold increase in the chance that your foot will be amputated and a threefold increase in the chance that you will be hospitalized—for <em>anything!</em> In fact, diabetic foot ulcers are the number one cause of foot amputations in the US, which happen once every 3 minutes there.</p>

<p>What’s the shift-left moment here? Early detection! A diabetic patient with a foot ulcer costs “the system” approximately $58,000 a year to treat, while a diabetic without one costs about $17,000 a year to treat. How can we detect foot ulcers early? We can do it with thermometry, which is the measurement of temperature, which in turn is basically a measure of the amount of kinetic energy possessed by particles. As it turns out, inflammation is a precursor to a foot ulcer, and with inflammation comes an increase in temperature (which a patient may not feel due to neuropathy). Finding foot “hotspots” to create a baseline is all part of a potential shift-left diabetic moment. Can we create connected bath mats for home care that can track heat signatures and generate alerts, with historical understanding of what is normal and what is a strong potential for (or prediction of) a developing foot ulcer?</p>

<p>Like we said, every day, we walk by problems that we think we can solve (or make better) with technology. Imagine what society could do for diabetics if we took back about 70% of the variance cost (the difference between the annual cost of treating a diabetic with a foot ulcer and that of treating a patient without one) and used those renovation dollars as innovation dollars (for things like cures and management) instead<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_healthcareexamplesshiftleft118697" data-type="indexterm" id="id354"/>!</p>

<h3>And so many more</h3>

<p>The previous two examples can’t do justice to just how impactful this shift-left mindset can be to your business. But hopefully, you can now easily recognize that understanding technology allows you to look at your business in an entirely different way.</p>

<p>There are many more examples of shifting left<em> </em>that we can talk about:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)" data-type="indexterm" id="id355"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="VA (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs)" data-type="indexterm" id="id356"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="VA" data-type="indexterm" id="id357"/> has a six-month backlog of claims to process. Automating rote tasks involved in this process shifts the mundane left and delivers benefits faster to those who served.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The Swedish<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Swedish public services use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id358"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="Swedish public services" data-type="indexterm" id="id359"/> government is building its own public service GenAI models for a myriad of shift-left opportunities to better service its citizens. Imagine a government chat interface that understands the nuances and cultural references for the different Swedish provinces and interacts with an understanding of those colloquialisms.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Insurance<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="insurance use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id360"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="insurance" data-type="indexterm" id="id361"/> companies take months to process complex or large claims. Shifting left all the repetitive and policy-check work involved in this helps get those claims settled faster and with less friction, thereby delivering coverage dollars in a timelier manner where they are needed and establishing a better relationship with customers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The pharmaceutical<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pharmaceutical industry use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id362"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="pharma" data-type="indexterm" id="id363"/> company Amgen spends months sending surveys to doctors around the world, looking for relevant clinical and demographic participants for clinical trials. It’s estimated that 80% of Amgen’s studies miss their recruitment targets in a process that takes up to 18 months. AI helped Amgen shift-left recruitment times by identifying clinics and doctors based on their performance in recruiting patients for trials. (Doctors heavily sway a clinic’s disposition to participate, and some doctors pick bad candidates who drop out.) We call this use case the <em>ideal customer profile</em> (ICP), and this concept can be used in all industries to study things like what toppings someone might order on their pizza, what they’ll watch when they eat it, and and who will experience the heartburn that follows.</p>

	<p>Another pharmaceutical company, Bayer, shifted left the number of participants needed for a late-stage trial of Asundexian (a drug designed to reduce long-term risks of strokes in adults). Without AI, Bayer noted that it would have spent millions more and taken nine months longer to recruit participants and get its trial under way. These are great examples of shifting left (spending money to save money) and then shifting right (having faster trials, meaning spending money to not just make money but to save lives or deliver better quality of life).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>It can take a long time to get a purchase order<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="office supplies, shift-left opportunity" data-type="indexterm" id="id364"/> for a larger item (like an office chair) through a corporation’s procurement system, which is likely riddled with disconnected processes, paperwork, offshore approvers, and near-shore workflow overseers. This means it can take months to get even the simplest items delivered—so let’s sit more ergonomically and shift this left!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>North America is on the brink of its fourth overwhelming healthcare problem: chronic loneliness. Yes, it’s a healthcare problem, and its symptoms include depression, alcoholism, addiction, homelessness, anger, and erratic behavior, among others. The most vulnerable are seniors—but imagine how AI could shift-left the costs of this problem by providing occasional fill-in-the-gaps companionship for isolated people, as long as it is done responsibly and aids in establishing real human contacts.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Some companies have HR enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems" data-type="indexterm" id="id365"/> that literally take 20 minutes of clicking to transfer an employee to another department! Not surprisingly, they come with high failure rates. We no longer walk by this problem at IBM. Our chief human resources officer (CHRO), Nickel LaMoreaux, personally skilled up on the very things we are covering in this book and drove a plan to shift this left. Today, employee transfer failure rates are pretty much nil, and over 4,000 hours have been returned to the business in the form of “think time.” We’d be remiss if we didn’t again remind you how this is a great example of the best way to start your modern AI journey: by spending money to save money on internal automation use cases. What’s more, her team gained skills and confidence on this rollout, and that has led to literally dozens of other innovations, with staggering time-saved metrics and dollars saved across the IBM business. (In aggregate, across all functions, actions like these have saved IBM $3 billion since inception.)</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, it doesn’t matter whether the task is as small as transferring an employee to another department or as large as changing someone’s quality of life with assisted movement. There’s a lot to be gained by shifting left!</p>

<p>The bottom line is that there’s a heck of a lot of work that needs to get done. Which technology can help you address all this work? If you look around, we think you’re going to land in the same place we did—with GenAI and agents<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_shiftingleft117861" data-type="indexterm" id="id366"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Now, shift right" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch01_now_shift_right_1740182043984466">
<h3>Now, shift right</h3>

<p>Now that you’re shifting<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="shifting right" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_shiftingright123640"/> part of your business left and are saving time, money, and even lives, you’ve got the confidence and experience to shift right by spending money to make money (that is, doing the transformational stuff in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_7_1740182043962447">Figure 1-4</a>). Shifting right is the ideation of new business models, but it can also be a pivotal move when the stakes could be the life or death of a company or industry.</p>

<p>We’ve seen what happens when you <em>don’t</em> shift right. Look at Kodak<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kodak use case, failure to shift right" data-type="indexterm" id="id367"/>, which did pioneering work in the field of photography. While Kodak was a story of success (it was once one of the most successful companies in the world), it is also one of spectacular failure. What happened? Kodak thought it was in the film business and got myopic when trying to protect it; after all, it was Kodak that invented the digital camera back in 1975. But as we now know today, Kodak was really in the memory-making business, and when the modality of memories shifted right, the memory-making business went digital. (Sometimes, shifting right is your strategy, and sometimes, technology changes and you have no choice but to shift right with it.) This shift right transformed an entire industry and created new business models. Pictures could not only be shared more easily, but you could take more of them without paying to print bad photos. You got to choose the pictures you wanted to keep instead of waiting three days only to find that your brother Doug ruined the family photo with bunny rabbit fingers behind Grandma’s head, while cousin Jimmy on the right was flying low. You could also store more pictures in less space because your laptop could hold files with pictures that would take up about 85 feet of shelf space in printed form.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch01.html#id368" id="id368-marker">2</a></sup> Companies used technology to shift photography to the right. Amateurs became professionals with software editing tools, frictionless photo printing, ways to organize and retrieve photos, and tag people’s faces in photos...and you know how the story went for Kodak.</p>

<p>Now, think about another company: Garmin<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Garmin use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id369"/>, which initially became famous for its portable GPS navigation systems for cars. While this use case hasn’t completely gone away (there is still a segment that values these units because of their reliability and accuracy), Garmin realized the modality of navigation had changed. But Garmin also realized something much bigger—they weren’t in the car navigation business; they were in the tracking and mapping business. Garmin shifted right to bring new services to marine and hiking activities, among others. They changed the way amateur golf is played with not just a map of a course but with all kinds of in-game features and course statistics. Communities sprouted up around area mapping and recommendations—sharing suggestions for runs or hikes, enhancing experiences and accuracy via crowdsourced corrections, and more. Now, think about how GenAI and agents can shift this mapping business even further right.</p>

<p>Sometimes, shifting right isn’t just about repurposing what you already have to invent a new chassis for the technology. It’s also about bringing entirely new business models to market (which again is the far-right part of <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_7_1740182043962447">Figure 1-4</a>). For example, Airbnb<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Airbnb" data-type="indexterm" id="id370"/> was founded by a group of guys who were struggling to pay rent. They noticed that all the hotels in San Francisco were sold out during a conference, and a light bulb went off. They shifted the lodging industry right!</p>

<p>Think about your relationship with your insurance<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="insurance use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id371"/> company—it’s kind of set up in an adversarial manner, isn’t it? You talk to your agent to get a policy underwritten, you have no claims. You talk to your agent next year, and your rates go up. Or, you get into some kind of accident, make a claim, and your rates go up then. Either way, it certainly never feels like any sort of partnership.</p>

<p>Now, think about underwriting risk at a worksite. Typically, an employer wants to comply with work safety regulations because it doesn’t want its employees to get hurt. And it’s also fair to say that the insurance company that assumes the risk certainly doesn’t want to pay for the care of hurt people and doesn’t want people to get hurt in the first place either.</p>

<p>GenAI and agents can come together to completely change the insurance relationship by shifting right the way risk is underwritten on a construction site. Consider using AI to monitor a jobsite for proper gowning (identifying worker code‒required safety helmets, jackets, gloves, proximity to electrified equipment, and so on). In this use case, cameras are set up in different safety zones that use AI models to flag worker safety compliance with per-zone requirements. You can place one camera in a zone where the risk is related to welding and fire, while you can place another where a crane operator is lifting steel beams for storage. AI vision can track compliant and out-of-compliance events, and agentic workflows can stitch together the video, flag the compliance issues with red boxes, and generate a summary report (hourly, daily, weekly...you name it). To continue the example, say an accident occurs and the risk can be subsequently underwritten with a higher premium for that single zone (but not the entire site) the very next day. In that case, the site operator will have a chance to reduce that risk premium by complying with recommendations from AI-generated reports that update the underwriter using AI-infused real-time processing on the edge. There are numerous ways to make this scenario play out (per-zone compliance, site compliance, per-day pricing, monthly pricing, and so on), but it’s a definite shift right to a new business model and a new relationship model<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_generativeAIGenAIshiftingleftandshiftingright117861" data-type="indexterm" id="id372"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_shiftingright123640" data-type="indexterm" id="id373"/>.</p>

<p>Businesses should include plans<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI Value Creator" data-secondary="versus AI user" data-secondary-sortas="AI user" data-type="indexterm" id="id374"/> to fine-tune AI models with their company’s data as part of their AI strategy. These models will be under the businesses’ control—they will own the models because they will become their company’s (arguably) most valuable assets. In fact, Barry Melancon (the recently retired CEO of the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants, the most influential body of professional accountants, with over 650,000 members) told us he believes a day is coming when models will be recorded as assets in financials. We jump all over this topic in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_oh_to_be_an_ai_value_creator_1740182046162988">Chapter 2</a>, where you will learn the difference between being an AI Value Creator and being an AI User.

<h2>Tip 3: One Model Will Not Rule Them All, So Make a Bet <span class="keep-together">on Community</span></h2>

<p>You want to marry cutting-edge technology with a cutting-edge community. The open source AI community<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="open source AI" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_opensourceAI1259115"/> (not to be confused with Open AI) is continuously supercharging the value companies will be able to create using GenAI and agentic workflows. Basically, we’re telling you not to just place a bet on community—make a <em>big bet on </em>community! Place your AI bets on the open AI community. (Hint: understanding whether a company is open or not goes well beyond their name.) As sure as many of you may have ever only heard of or used a single LLM (like ChatGPT), we would bet our reputation on this promise: <em>a single AI model will not rule them all, and your business will benefit from innovations and models that are coming out of open communities too. </em>You’re witnessing this firsthand today—highly effective open source models like Granite, Llama, and DeepSeek are constantly making waves. That’s why we tell companies, when they’re investing in the components of their AI platform, to ensure that those platform components are flexible so that they can put both open and proprietary models to work for their business.</p>

<p>This is exactly why companies like Meta and IBM have announced strong partnerships with Hugging Face<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Hugging Face" data-type="indexterm" id="id375"/>. Hugging Face is the social butterfly of the AI world. It’s all about creating and sharing a community of AI models. We like to think of it as the matchmaker between cutting-edge AI research and developers who want to create cool stuff with it. Hugging Face has a cute logo that makes you feel warm and fuzzy (OK, just warm) that fronts a huge corpus of models, education, and benchmarks, and it tries to make AI accessible to everyone.</p>

<p>Hugging Face’s story is curious, indeed, and that curiosity goes well beyond a neat name with a cute logo. Hugging Face worked on conversational AI for three years, and as is sometimes the case with startups, the underlying platform and technology ended up being more useful than the end product.</p>

Tiny Speck’s founder, Stewart Butterfield<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Butterfield, Stewart" data-type="indexterm" id="id377"/>, famously said, “If we keep going as we are, we’ll burn through the rest of our money in a few months and be left with nothing to show for it. But if we stop now, we can use that money to build something else.” And so, he took the communication platform that Tiny Speck built, and the rest is history. Just like Hugging Face, Slack was born out of a different mission, and now look at the impacts of both on our world.</p>

<p>When Hugging Face started to release parts of its work on GitHub, it started to see open source contributors joining it and also started to see practitioners sharing their models.</p>

<p>Now, you might be thinking, “Everyone talks about open community-built technology, but there are thousands of go-nowhere open source software products or those that overlap.” And you’re right! In fact, we talk to some clients who bring up supposedly open technologies they’re investigating only to discover that a single vendor steers and builds 98% of that technology, which misses the point of open source. In our opinion, a critical component of open source is the fact that a <em>community collaborates and builds together, not just that the code can be looked at.</em></p>

<p>You may be curious about just how much energy is concentrated in the Hugging Face<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Hugging Face" data-type="indexterm" id="id378"/> AI community and how much progress and creativity you should expect from it. The answer is simple: the energy is insane. There is a funny ditty about when Clément Delangue<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Delangue, Clément" data-type="indexterm" id="id379"/> (one of Hugging Face’s founders, who is also their CEO) tweeted out an invitation to an ad hoc GenAI meetup in San Francisco on a business trip and expected about 20 people. The event planners had to change locations 3 times and ended up with 5,000 people! People started calling it “the Woodstock of AI”—so like we said, the energy is insane.</p>

<p>Today, there are tens of thousands (if not more) companies using the Hugging Face platform, including very large companies and institutions like Google, IBM, Meta, MIT, and Bloomberg, and smaller companies too. And collectively, they have shared open models, datasets, and open demos on the platform. When we were reviewing the final drafts of this book, Hugging Face had almost one and a half million models, so we just stopped counting and declared that one model will <em>not</em> rule them all (which so happens to be part of <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ch07_where_this_technology_is_headed_one_model_will_not_1740182051667482">Chapter 7</a>’s title). And to bring it all into perspective, the open source Llama<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Llama" data-type="indexterm" id="id380"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Meta" data-secondary="Llama" data-type="indexterm" id="id381"/> model (by Meta) has had over 650,000,000 downloads since inception—so certainly, there is energy and interest around open source AI<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_opensourceAI1259115" data-type="indexterm" id="id382"/>.</p>

<h2>Tip 4: Run Everywhere, Efficiently</h2>

<p>Our world has moved from the <em>Internet of Things</em> (IoT), where everything can talk to all the things because they are connected, to the <em>Internet of Everything</em>, where everything<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Internet of Everything (IoE)" data-type="indexterm" id="id383"/> talks to everything (one of us couldn’t vacuum the house the other day because their WiFi was down). And soon, it will become the <em>Intelligence of Everything</em> (AI on the edge). So, you need to start thinking about optimizing your AI projects for performance, latency, and cost by building on open hybrid technologies and the ability to run models where they need to run (perhaps in the single envelope of a GPU, a device with no GPU at all, or on a bathroom mat that measures foot temperature, which is to say that smaller models are going to matter).</p>

<h2>Tip 5: Be Responsible Because Trust Is the Ultimate License to Operate</h2>

<p>We saved the most important tip for last. We can’t stress this enough: <em>every tip we just gave you is useless unless you build AI responsibly<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="governance" data-secondary="in business use of GenAI" data-type="indexterm" id="id384"/> and transparently and put governance into the heart of the AI lifecycle</em>.</p>

<p>Businesses should remember to continuously govern their data (meaning they should have an IA) and cocreate with trusted partners. <em>Trust will be your ultimate license to operate.</em> When it comes to using data, it’s easy to find hundreds of examples of good actors and bad actors and of upstanders and bystanders. It’s why you need to ensure you fully trust the companies you choose to partner with on your AI journeys. Think of it this way: you lose trust in buckets and gain it in droplets. We think you should look for partners with full buckets—their actions, their products, and the way they go about building their LLMs all start with trust and transparency. Always be working hard to keep <em>your</em> trust bucket full—keeping in mind that it’s going to require making fairness, explainability, and ethics (among other things) the first thoughts and not afterthoughts. This is the difference between the steady pace of a fire drill and the panic over facing a real fire when you’ve done zero preparation<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_foundationmodelsFMstipsforharnessingforbusiness124822" data-type="indexterm" id="id385"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_businessconsiderationsharnessingfoundationmodels124822" data-type="indexterm" id="id386"/>.</p>

<h1>And with That, Let’s Focus on the AI Part</h1>

<p>We’ve covered a lot of ground related to the business part of AI in this chapter. We’ve talked about moving from +AI to AI+, and a year from now, we’re confident that anyone who reads this book will have done something with GenAI. The question is whether you (and the companies you work for) will move faster than your competition. Will you climb our rebooted AI Ladder and use IA and AI to truly become an AI+ business?</p>

<p>We hope some of the examples we’ve given you in this chapter will inspire you to think about what’s possible (there’s more use cases coming in <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#ch04_the_use_case_chapter_1740182047877425">Chapter 4</a>). We also hope that you will take the opportunity to try some of this technology yourself, continue getting inspired by its potential to transform your business, and stop walking by problems every day that you can make better or solve with technology.</p>
