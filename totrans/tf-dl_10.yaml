    discussed a wide variety of algorithms, and delved deeply into a number of sophisticated
    case studies. Readers who’ve been working through the examples covered in this
    book are now well prepared to use deep learning on the job, and to start reading
    the large research literature on deep learning methods.

    impact in the technology industry already, but deep learning is beginning to dramatically
    alter the state of essentially all nontech industries and to even shift the global
    geopolitical balance. Your understanding of this epochal technology will open
    many doors you may not have envisioned. In this final chapter, we will briefly
    survey some of the important applications of deep learning outside the software
    industry.

    your new knowledge effectively and ethically. Deep learning is a technology of
    such power that it’s important for practitioners to think about how to use their
    skills properly. There have already been numerous misuses of deep learning, so
    it behooves new practitioners to pause before building sophisticated deep learning
    systems to ask whether the systems they are building are ethically sound. We will
    attempt to provide a brief discussion of ethical best practices, but caution the
    area of software ethics is complex enough that brief discussions are unlikely
    to do it full justice.

    that have the full range of abilities of humans? There exist a wide range of expert

    made heavy investments in deep learning infrastructure. Most of these companies
    were already familiar with machine learning systems, likely from past experiences
    with machine learning such as with ad prediction systems or search engines. As
    a result, shifting to deep learning from older machine learning systems took only
    a small conceptual shift. Also, the success of past machine learning applications
    has made tech management quite open to the argument that deep learning could be
    more widely applied within companies. For these reasons, software companies are
    likely to remain the most prominent users of deep learning for the near future.
    If you intend to find a job using deep learning within the next couple years,
    it’s likely that you will end up at a tech company.

    is beginning to infiltrate industries that historically have not used much machine
    learning. Unlike simpler machine learning methods, deep learning reduces the need
    for sophisticated feature preprocessing and allows for direct input of perceptual,
    textual, and molecular data. As a result, a number of industries are taking note,
    and large-scale efforts to overhaul these industries have already begun in many
    innovative startups. We will now briefly discuss some of the changes happening
    in nearby industries and note that many new job opportunities for deep learning
    experts may become available in the near future.

    industries. The striking fact about these applications is that all of them use
    the same fundamental deep learning algorithms. Techniques you’ve seen such as
    fully connected networks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and reinforcement
    learning are broadly applicable to any of these fields. In particular, that means
    core improvements in convolutional network design will yield fruit in pharmaceutical,
    agricultural, and robotics applications. In reverse, deep learning innovations
    discovered by roboticists will filter back and strengthen the foundations of deep
    learning. This virtuous cycle of fundamentals driving application driving fundamentals
    means that deep learning is a force that’s here to stay.

    Drug discovery is broken down into multiple phases. There’s the preclinical discovery
    phase, where the effects of potential drugs are tested indirectly in test tubes
    and in animals, followed by the clinical phase where therapeutics are tested directly
    in human volunteers. Medicine that passes both nonhuman and human testing is approved
    for sale to consumers.

    discovery process. For example, molecular deep learning has been applied to problems
    such as predicting the potential toxicity of putative medications and to chemical
    problems involved in the synthesis and design of drug-like molecules. Other researchers
    and companies are using deep convolutional networks to design new experiments
    that closely track cellular behavior on massive scales to obtain stronger understanding
    of novel biology. These applications have had some impact on the pharmaceutical
    world, but nothing dramatic yet since it isn’t possible to build one drug discovery
    model that “designs” a novel drug. However, as more data gathering efforts continue
    and more biological and chemical deep learning models are designed, this state
    of affairs could change drastically in the next few years.

    arguments about the legality or illegality of new cases. Traditionally, legions
    of paralegal researchers have been employed by large law firms to perform the

    learning systems for neurolinguistic processing (NLP) can offer significant improvements.
    For example, a number of startups are working on building deep NLP systems that
    offer better querying of legal precedent. Other startups are working on predictive
    methods that use machine learning to predict the outcome of litigation, while
    a few are even experimenting with methods for automated generation of legal arguments.

    systems, combined with low data learning techniques, can offer dramatic improvements

    can be deployed to learn robotic object control, using a factory of robotic arms
    to enable large-scale training on real robots (see [Figure 10-1](#ch10-googlearms)).
    It’s likely that such enhanced learning techniques for robots will begin filtering

    information, nearly all aspects of human life will fall under algorithmic sway.

    models from data without too much effort. This solidly mathematical process can
    provide the mirage of objectivity. However, it is strongly worth noting that all
    sorts of bias can creep into such analyses. Biases in the underlying data, drawn
    from historical, prejudiced records, can induce models to learn fundamentally
    unfair models. Google infamously once learned that a flawed visual prediction
    model had labeled black consumers as gorillas, likely due to biased training data
    that lacked adequate representation of people of color. While this system was
    rapidly corrected once brought to Google’s notice, such failures are deeply troubling
    and are emblematic of more fundamental problems of exclusion in the technology
    industry.

    (AGI) will soon come into existence. Experts disagree strongly over whether AGI
    is worth seriously planning for. Our view is that while there’s no harm in doing
    research on “AI value alignment” and “safe reward function” design, the artificial
    intelligence systems of today and the foreseeable future are unlikely to rapidly
    achieve sentience. As you will have learned first hand, most deep learning systems
    are simply sophisticated numerical engines, prone to many finicky numerical stability
    issues. It will likely take decades of fundamental advances before general intelligence
    becomes an issue. At the same time, as we’ve discussed in the previous section,
    artificial intelligence is already having dramatic impact on human societies and
    industries. It is absolutely worth worrying about the effects of AI without the
    need to conjure superintelligent bogeymen.

    a profound impact upon the discourse surrounding AI. The basic premise of the
    book is that an intelligence explosion could occur when models become capable
    of recursively improving themselves. In itself, the premise of the book isn’t
    that radical. If AGI were to come into existence, there’s no reason to suppose
    that it couldn’t succeed in improving itself rapidly.

    that worrying about superintelligence is like worrying about overpopulation on
    Mars. One day, humanity is likely to reach Mars. When enough people land on Mars,
    overcrowding will likely exist and may even be a very serious problem. None of
    this changes the fact that Mars today is an empty wasteland. So too is the state
    of the literature on creating generally intelligent AI!

    and generative modeling holds much promise for creating more intelligent agents.
    But, stressing over the possibilities for superintelligent entities detracts from

    even mention other serious challenges facing us, such as global warming.
