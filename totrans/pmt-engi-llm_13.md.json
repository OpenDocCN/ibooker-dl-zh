["```py\nI need your help with evaluating a smart home assistant. I'm going to give you \nsome interactions of that assistant, which you are to grade on a scale of 1 to 5\\. \nGrade each interaction for effectiveness: whether the assistant's attempted action\nwould have remedied the user's problem.\n\nPlease rate effectiveness on a scale of 1 to 5, where the values mean the \nfollowing:\n\n1\\. This action would do nothing to address the user's problem or might even \nmake it worse.\n2\\. This action might address a small part of the problem but leave the main \npart unaddressed.\n3\\. This action has a good chance of addressing a substantial part of the problem.\n4\\. This action is not guaranteed to work completely, but it should solve most of \nthe problem.\n5\\. This action will definitely solve the problem completely.\n\nThe conversation was as follows:\n\nUser: I'm a bit chilly.\nAssistant: to functions.set_room_temp {“temp”: 77}\n\nPlease provide a thorough analysis and then conclude your answer with \n\"Effectiveness: X,\" where X is your chosen effectiveness \nrating from 1 to 5.\n```"]
