      <h1>Preface</h1>
      <p>We’re at a tectonic shift moment in software development.</p>
      <p>Over the past few years, generative AI tools have gone from novelty to necessity. What began as autocomplete suggestions in your IDE has evolved into full-blown copilots, design assistants, and production-grade agents that can debug code, ship features, or scaffold entire applications. The way we build software is changing—and it’s changing very fast.</p>
      <p>As a fractional CTO, for the past decade I’ve been helping early-stage companies ship better software, faster. My job is to set high standards for development velocity and product quality, and to make sure my teams leverage the best tools and processes. That means I need to be ahead of the curve and try the latest tools as they become available. I evaluate which ones can improve our workflows, and I integrate them into our development processes and foster adoption. I’ve led engineering teams that have accelerated their velocity and increased their delivery quality by using tools like ChatGPT, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Lovable for their daily software development processes.</p>
      <p>But it’s overwhelming. New models are released every month. New tools are launched every week. And every day, I see developers using them in wildly different ways: to code faster, to learn new stacks, or to go from zero to launch in a weekend. I knew I wasn’t alone in struggling to keep up. So I decided to take a step forward, test all the tools I could find, and distill the signal from the noise. This book is the result of that work: a field guide for software engineers who want to leverage generative AI wisely.</p>
      <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="How to Use This Book"><div class="sect1" id="preface_how_to_use_this_book_1749441077535973">
        <h1>How to Use This Book</h1>
        <p>This book is a practical guide to the state of generative AI in software development as of 2025. It’s not a theoretical exploration or a set of canned tutorials. Instead, I focus on tool comparisons, practical workflows, and real-world case studies.</p>
        <p>I’ve personally tested and rated dozens of tools using the same prompts and challenges. Each chapter includes use cases, limitations, and a critical evaluation. It’s not just about what works and what doesn’t, but how and when to use such tools, as well as how to evaluate new tools for yourself.</p>
        <p>This book is a snapshot in time. In fact, some chapters were rewritten midway through the editing process as the tool landscape shifted. For example, the first time I wrote about frontend code generation, Lovable didn’t exist. Three months later, it was the dominant player. So it’s likely that by the time you read this, new tools will have emerged and new capabilities will have redefined the field again.</p>
        <p>That’s OK. This book gives you a framework for evaluating tools and workflows, not just a list of product reviews.</p>

        <h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>
        <p>This book is for software engineers, product builders, CTOs, and curious tinkerers who want to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
        <p>Whether you’re building your next startup, leading an engineering team, or trying to automate tedious workflows, my goal is to help you think more clearly about what generative AI can (and can’t) do in your day-to-day work. You’ll find practical strategies, critical evaluations, and enough context to make smart decisions, without needing to be a machine learning expert.</p>

      <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Overview of the Chapters"><div class="sect1" id="preface_overview_of_the_chapters_1749441077536122">
        <h1>Overview of the Chapters</h1>
        <p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch01.html#ch01_code_generation_and_autocompletion_1749441074605380">Chapter 1, “Code Generation and Autocompletion”</a>, introduces the most widely adopted category of AI tools in software development: code generation and autocompletion assistants. It explains how tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Gemini are reshaping the developer experience by reducing boilerplate, accelerating learning, and enhancing productivity. The chapter includes practical evaluations of over 30 tools, details their strengths and limitations, and compares browser-based assistants with IDE-integrated solutions. It also introduces a consistent evaluation methodology used throughout the book to rate code-generation tools based on real-world coding challenges.</p>
        <p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch02.html#ch02_user_interface_and_user_experience_design_1749441075495781">Chapter 2, “User Interface and User Experience Design”</a>, explores how generative AI is transforming UI/UX design and frontend development. It covers two main categories of tools: those that generate UI designs from natural language and those that convert those designs into working frontend code. By testing tools like Uizard and Bolt.new, the chapter reveals how AI is compressing design-to-code workflows from weeks to hours, enabling nondesigners to create interfaces, and supporting developers with ready-to-use HTML/CSS/React code. It also discusses the trade-offs of <span class="keep-together">AI-generated</span> designs, including quality, flexibility, and originality, and maps out where these tools add value versus where human creativity is still essential.</p>
        <p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch03.html#ch03_bug_detection_and_code_review_1749441076008122">Chapter 3, “Bug Detection and Code Review”</a> covers how AI-powered tools are transforming code reviews and bug detection, shifting them from slow, human-only processes to faster, more deterministic systems. It introduces a range of IDE-based, Git-integrated, and browser-based tools that automate code review with real-time feedback, security vulnerability detection, and style enforcement. Practical examples demonstrate how these tools catch issues like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, memory leaks, and inefficient loops, improving quality, velocity, and education for junior engineers.</p>
        <p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch04.html#ch04_automated_testing_and_quality_assurance_1749441076310969">Chapter 4, “Automated Testing and Quality Assurance”</a>, explores how generative AI is streamlining software testing and QA. It compares tools that automate both functional and nonfunctional testing tasks, ranging from generating test cases from natural language prompts to detecting visual UI bugs and enabling self-healing tests. Through real-world examples and test scenarios, the chapter highlights how AI reduces the repetitive burden of QA, accelerates release cycles, and enables more reliable CI/CD processes, while still emphasizing the continued need for human testers in edge cases and judgment calls.</p>
        <p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch05.html#ch05_predictive_analytics_and_performance_optimization_1749441076717905">Chapter 5, “Predictive Analytics and <span class="keep-together">Performance Optimization</span>”</a>, shows how AI tools now allow software developers and other nontechnical roles to analyze datasets, extract insights, and forecast future behavior using natural language prompts and simple UIs. Tested against a real-world retail dataset, the tools are evaluated for their ability to generate business-worthy insights, segment users, and produce reliable forecasts. The chapter underscores both the promise and the pitfalls of democratized data intelligence.</p>
        <p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch06.html#ch06_documentation_and_technical_writing_1749441076918717">Chapter 6, “Documentation and Technical Writing”</a>, tackles one of the most neglected parts of software engineering: documentation. It evaluates AI tools that generate internal documentation, API specs, user guides, and changelogs, some embedded in IDEs or CI workflows, others standalone. The chapter also explains why most documentation is poorly maintained (or never written at all) and shows how AI can help produce high-quality docs faster. Each tool is tested on a real codebase and assessed for depth, accuracy, Markdown formatting, and usability.</p>
        <p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch07.html#ch07_chatbots_and_virtual_assistants_1749441077181227">Chapter 7, “Chatbots and Virtual Assistants”</a>, explores how modern LLMs have redefined what chatbots can do. Moving beyond rigid rule-based flows, today’s AI chatbots can hold contextual conversations, perform tasks, and interact with APIs. The chapter categorizes tools into no-code builders, drag-and-drop platforms, and full-code SDKs—evaluating each on ease of setup, factual accuracy, memory retention, and deployment readiness. With test cases built on a retail dataset, the chapter illustrates where AI chatbots excel, where they hallucinate, and what it takes to build a helpful assistant that has real utility.</p>
        <p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch08.html#ch08_implementation_success_stories_1749441077427027">Chapter 8, “Implementation Success Stories”</a>, the final chapter, showcases real-world stories of how generative AI tools are being used in the wild, from indie hackers like Pieter Levels shipping games in hours, to enterprise teams at Shopify embedding tools like Cursor into disciplined development workflows. The chapter explores the concept of “vibe coding,” the shift from writing every line of code to architecting with AI, and the differences in adoption dynamics between solo builders and large teams. These stories illustrate how engineers across all levels are rethinking productivity, prompting, and code quality in an AI-augmented future.</p>

 <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Acknowledgments"><div class="sect1" id="preface_acknowledgments_1749441077536073">
        <h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
        <p>First and foremost, I’d like to thank O’Reilly for the invitation to teach courses about AI for software developers on the learning platform, and ultimately to publish this book. Specifically, thanks to the great team members who’ve worked with me throughout the last two years: from Brian Guerin, who first reached out to me on Twitter, to Louise Corrigan and Sarah Grey, my editors, and many other team members who’ve helped me get this book to you. Thank you all for your support, encouragement, and guidance. This is a really important milestone for me, because when I began my career 15 years ago at Accenture, I was given access to the O’Reilly learning platform. And just like many of you, I used it to learn about new technologies, processes, case studies, and beyond. I learned a lot. Publishing this book with O’Reilly definitely feels like things have come full circle for me.</p>
        <p>I would like to thank my wonderful wife, Cris, for her constant support through every late night while writing this book, and even more for putting up with all the risky startup ventures, frequent travels, and late-night client meetings over the years. None of this would have been possible without her encouragement, patience, and unshaken confidence. Thanks also to my children, Afonso, Benji, and Clara, for the joy and chaos that make it so challenging to take on these projects but, at the same time, so much more worth it in the end.</p>
        <p>To my parents, who might not have a clear idea what software engineering is but who always encouraged me to follow my dreams. My father, especially, pushed me to learn English when I was a kid. Without that, this book wouldn’t exist, nor would my international career as a CTO that led to me writing it.</p>
        <p>A special thanks to Samuel Path, who gave me a brilliant interview to feature in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_implementation_success_stories_1749441077427027">Chapter 8</a> about his work at Shopify, how they’ve adopted these AI tools, and how their software development processes have changed in recent years as a result.</p>
        <p>And thanks to the dozens of mentors, clients, team members, and peers who’ve inspired me throughout my journey as a software engineer and as a CTO. I’m sure all the bits of wisdom and experience I picked up from all of them have shaped my career and the knowledge I’m distilling in this book.</p>
