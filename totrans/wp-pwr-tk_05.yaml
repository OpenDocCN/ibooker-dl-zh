    themes. They are more likely to be abandoned by their designer. Instead, use a *freemium *theme—one
    that has both a free and a paid version. When a theme provides income, its developer
    is less likely to quit updating it, thus forcing you to change to a different
    theme. That said, the free themes provided by WordPress itself aren’t abandoned.

    that the page layout, menu, and other elements of your site will be effectively
    redrawn and rearranged so a visitor to your site can easily read, click, and otherwise
    interact on *any* size screen. Your site is going to be viewed on screens ranging
    in size from flat-screen TVs down to cellphones. Clearly, it’s a necessary, albeit
    challenging, task to accommodate all of these dimensions and screen shapes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most site builders construct their sites on a desktop monitor, but most visitors
    to a site will be using a cellphone (it’s estimated that 60% of all internet traffic
    is via cellphone). Clearly, links that are easily clicked by a mouse on a 27-inch
    monitor can be quite hard to hit with a finger on a cellphone screen—unless there’s
    plenty of space between the links.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Responsiveness requires a variety of adjustments. For example, what appears
    as a horizontal list of menu items on a large screen will be displayed vertically
    on a cellphone. Sometimes the word “Menu” is all you see. The visitor taps that
    word to open a vertical list of the menu items.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A quality theme will ensure responsiveness—text is easy to read, links can be
    easily triggered, and page design isn’t askew—even when reduced down to a 2-inch-wide
    cellphone screen. That said, before you make your site public, test it on several
    screen sizes and shapes—phone, tablet, laptop, and monitor—to see if you need
    to do some tweaking. And note that Google judges the quality of sites by their
    mobile friendliness, among many other things.

    for that purpose. So, if you want a different look for, say, your blog page or
    several pages displaying your catalog, you might try a multi-theme installation.
    But honestly, having multiple themes is probably more trouble than it’s worth.
    Plugins supporting multiple themes come and go rather quickly, so if you install
    one, you’ll likely end up having to find a replacement plugin at some point. Such
    plugins can also slow down your site or create side effects and incompatibilities.

    that offers many page templates. It has a drag-and-drop page builder that gives
    you freedom to design pages individually. And SeedProd supplies more than 150
    predesigned templates that can be applied individually to different pages. In
    effect, it’s like a multi-theme collection. Astra and Divi are also good multi-template

    CSS editor. And then, WordPress provides a link to your site’s Appearance > Customize

    blue (reliability, trustworthiness, and authority). Rarer is a green and white
    pairing, although green *is* associated with health. Red is extremely rare for

    it according to your questions:Balance in Composition:The composition is well-balanced
    with elements that guide the viewer’s eye across the scene. The two cranes form
    a natural point of interest and are balanced by the cluster of vibrant flowers
    on the left. The sunlight filtering through the trees creates a radiant point
    that contrasts with the cooler tones of the water and foliage, aiding in the balance.Avoidance
    of Symmetry:The composition has avoided strict symmetry, which contributes to
    a more dynamic and natural scene. While there are symmetrical elements, like the
    two cranes and the reflection on the water, they are offset by the uneven distribution
    of trees, flowers, and light. This asymmetry provides a sense of natural randomness
    and avoids the rigidity that can come with perfect symmetry.Focal Point:The clear
    focal points are the two cranes in the water. They are centrally located and are
    a point of contrast against the darker background of the water and trees. Their
    reflection in the water also enhances their prominence in the composition.Potential
    for Cropping:While the composition is already strong, cropping can be used to
    emphasize certain elements. For example, a crop that brings the cranes slightly
    off-center could enhance the dynamism of the composition, possibly adhering to
    the rule of thirds. Cropping out some of the right side might also focus the scene
    more on the cranes and the sunlight behind them.Let’s try a crop to see if we
    can shift the focus slightly and adhere more closely to the rule of thirds for
    an even more engaging composition. I’ll make the adjustments and show you the
    result.The image has been cropped to potentially enhance the composition by bringing

- en: Studies of eye movements have shown that the human eye naturally gravitates
    toward the intersection points in the rule of thirds grid when looking at images.
    (People don’t tend to start by looking at the center of a painting or web page.)
    So the grid works with this natural tendency, leading to more aesthetically pleasing,
    engaging, dynamic, and balanced images.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you locate your subject right in the middle of the screen, that tends to
    deaden the image, making it more static. The result usually suffers from a lack
    of dynamism similar to rigidly symmetrical layouts. Locating the subject off-center
    tends to result in a more forceful, alive, and just plain attractive image.

    alternative grids). One of the most well-known rules is called the golden ratio
    (or golden spiral). It’s a mathematical progression seen in nature in sunflowers,
    DNA, and nautilus seashells, as shown in figure 6.16.

    be approximately 25 × 1.618 = 40.45.'

    *Girl with a Pearl Earring* and the *Mona Lisa* are built on this pattern. It
    can be constructed by a series of squares whose lengths are Fibonacci numbers.
    Drawing arcs from opposite corners of each square within a frame creates a curve
    resembling a spiral, leading the viewer’s eye around the picture. Typically, the
    greatest detail is located in the smallest of the boxes. This rule is like a whirlpool
    and produces only that one focal point.

    minimalism. A minimalistic website page is usually best, unless you’re selling
    quilts or something. Upload a shot of your web page, and ask Midjourney (using
    the `--sref` feature with `–sw` set to `800`) or GPT to revise the image to make
    it more minimalist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Midjourney’s `--sref` feature is powerful. It means *style reference*. To use
    it, you upload an image (or several), and Midjourney creates new images in the
    style of the submitted images. You can adjust the amount of influence of the uploaded
    images by using the `–sw` (style weight) parameter. Give `–sw` a number between
    0 and 1,000.
  prefs: []

    defaults to `100` unless you use the `–cw` (character weight) parameter, which
    can be set from `0` to `100`. At `100`, the resulting images will replicate the
    clothing, hair, facial features, and even accessories of the uploaded images.
    But at `0`, only the face is copied, and clothing and other elements are not.
