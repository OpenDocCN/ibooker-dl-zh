<h1 class="calibre5">Preface</h1>

<p class="subtitle">Since<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="large language models (LLMs)" data-secondary="impact on software development" data-type="indexterm" id="id271" class="pcalibre3 calibre7 pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/> OpenAI introduced GPT-2 in early 2019, large language models (LLMs) have rapidly changed our world. In 2019, if you, as a coder, had a technical question, then you would search the internet for an answer. More often than not, there would be no answer, leaving only the option to post on some question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) forum in the possibly vain hope that <em class="hyperlink">someone</em> might answer you. But today, instead of breaking your flow, you just ask an LLM assistant for direct commentary on the code you’re working on. Moreover, you can even engage in a pairing session where the assistant writes the code to your specifications. This is just in the field of software engineering, and similar tectonic shifts are beginning to be felt in almost any field that you can name.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The reason that this revolution is taking place is because the LLM is truly a revolutionary technology that makes it possible to achieve in software what formerly could be done only through human interaction. LLMs can generate content, answer questions, extract tabular data from natural language text, summarize text, classify documents, translate, and (in principle) do just about anything that you can do with text—except that LLMs will do it many orders of magnitude faster and never stop for a break.</p>

<p class="subtitle">For entrepreneurs, this opens endless doors of opportunity in every field imaginable. But before you can take advantage of these opportunities, you have to be prepared. This book serves as a guide to help you understand LLMs, interact with them through prompt engineering, and build applications that will bring value to your users, your company, or yourself.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Who Is This Book For?" class="calibre6"><div class="preface" id="preface_who_is_this_book_for_1728407050562798">
<div class="calibre10"/><h1 class="calibre5">Who Is This Book For?</h1>

<p class="subtitle">This<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="target audience" data-type="indexterm" id="id272" class="pcalibre3 calibre7 pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/> book is written for application engineers. If you build software products that customers use, then this book is for you. If you build internal applications or data-processing workflows, then this book is also for you. The reason that we are being so inclusive is because we believe that the usage of LLMs will soon become ubiquitous. Even if your day-to-day work doesn’t involve prompt engineering or LLM workflow design, your codebase will be filled with usages of LLMs, and you’ll need to understand how to interact with them just to get your job done.</p>

<p class="subtitle">However, a subset of application engineers will be the dedicated LLM wranglers—these are the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="prompt engineering" data-secondary="role of prompt engineers" data-type="indexterm" id="id273" class="pcalibre3 calibre7 pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/> <em class="hyperlink">prompt engineers</em>. It’s their job to convert problems into a packet of information that the LLM can understand—which we call the <em class="hyperlink">prompt</em>—and then convert the LLM completions back into results that bring value to those who use the application. If this is your current role—or if you want this to be your role—then this book is <em class="hyperlink">especially</em> for you.</p>

<p class="subtitle">LLMs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="large language models (LLMs)" data-secondary="prerequisites to learning about" data-type="indexterm" id="id274" class="pcalibre3 calibre7 pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/> are very approachable—you speak with them in natural language. So, for this book, you won’t be expected to know everything about machine learning. But you do need to have a good grasp of basic engineering principles—you need to know how to program and how to use an API. Another prerequisite for this book is the ability to empathize, because unlike with any technology before, you need to understand how LLMs “think” so that you can guide them to generate the content you need. This book will show you how.</p>

<h1 class="calibre5">What You Will Learn</h1>

<p class="subtitle">The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="large language models (LLMs)" data-secondary="book overview" data-type="indexterm" id="id275" class="pcalibre3 calibre7 pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/> goal of this book is to equip you with all the theory, techniques, tips, and tricks you need to master prompt engineering and build successful LLM applications.</p>

<p class="subtitle">In <a data-type="xref" href="part01.html#part01" class="pcalibre3 calibre7 pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">Part I</a> of the book, we convey a foundational understanding of LLMs, their inner workings, and their functionality as text completion engines. We cover the extension of LLMs to their new role as chat engines, and we present a high-level approach to LLM application development.</p>

<p class="subtitle">In <a data-type="xref" href="part02.html#part02" class="pcalibre3 calibre7 pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">Part II</a>, we introduce the core techniques for prompt engineering—how to source context information, rank its importance for the task at hand, pack the prompt (without overloading it), and organize everything into a template that will result in high-quality completions that elicit the answer you need.</p>

<p class="subtitle">In <a data-type="xref" href="part03.html#part03" class="pcalibre3 calibre7 pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">Part III</a>, we move to more advanced techniques. We assemble loops, pipelines, and workflows of LLM inference to create conversational agency and LLM-driven workflows, and we then explain techniques for evaluating LLMs.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Throughout<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="large language models (LLMs)" data-secondary="underlying principle of" data-type="indexterm" id="id276" class="pcalibre3 calibre7 pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/> this book, we highlight one principle that underlies all others:</p>

<blockquote class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre11">
<p class="calibre12">At their core, LLMs are just text completion engines that mimic the text they see during their training.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="subtitle">If<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="prompt engineering" data-secondary="mastering" data-type="indexterm" id="id277" class="pcalibre3 calibre7 pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/> you process that statement deeply, then you’ll arrive at the same conclusions that we share throughout this book: when you want an LLM to behave a certain way, you have to shape the prompt to resemble patterns seen in training data—use clear language, rely upon existing patterns rather than creating new ones, and don’t drown the LLM in superfluous content. Once you master prompt engineering, you can build upon these skills by creating conversation agency and workflows—the dominant paradigms for LLM applications.</p>
