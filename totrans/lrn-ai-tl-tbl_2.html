&#13;
<p>Now that you have a history lesson on Tableau and AI in analytics under your belt, it’s time to dive in to getting hands-on experience with Tableau Pulse. In this chapter, I’ll take you step by step through everything you’ll need to know to get your first Pulse metric ready. I’ll walk you through key concepts and definitions, and you’ll see detailed images to help you navigate the platform.</p>&#13;

<h1>Purpose and Key Definitions</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I recently saw a presentation on <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Pulse" data-see="Tableau Pulse" data-type="indexterm" id="id340"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="purpose of" data-type="indexterm" id="id341"/>Tableau Pulse about its purpose. The presenter said that Pulse was designed to answer the 20% of questions that users ask 80% of the time. This is a common trope in data analytics, the Pareto principle, that helps to give an understanding of how Pulse fits into the Tableau ecosystem. To unpack this 80/20 principle a bit further, the speaker posited that end users tend to ask the same small subset of questions (the 20%) a majority of the time (80%). As an analytics professional, you might find this a little appalling, but take a step back, and there’s a decent amount of truth there. Imagine a social media manager who is tracking a campaign on Instagram. She may want to start her day by looking at key metrics that give her a sense of how the campaign is performing. Similarly, when you first get into your car, you may check the fuel gauge, see if the check engine light is on, and monitor tire pressure. That’s how you can imagine Pulse, and while I’ve not found any documentation to confirm, I have to imagine its name is based on the phrase <em>keeping your finger on the pulse</em>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section class="less_space pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="Prerequisites" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch02_prerequisites_1732595607647684">&#13;
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As mentioned in the Preface, Pulse is currently available only within Tableau Cloud. Tableau Cloud is the software as a service (SaaS) solution of <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Server" data-seealso="Tableau Cloud" data-type="indexterm" id="id342"/>Tableau Server, the web application that organizes, stores, and serves up Tableau content. Based on the <span class="keep-together">architecture</span> of how Pulse functions (see <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_1_1732595607634526">Figure 2-1</a>), I imagine that this limitation is due to the necessity for information to be taken from Tableau and passed through to an LLM that is completely separate and unrelated to the Tableau software. Similarly, the audit trail of the prompts would necessitate that information gets written to the Salesforce Data Cloud, which would require that the Tableau environment is available on the internet (not just a corporate intranet).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Pulse is disabled on each Tableau Cloud site by default. To <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="enabling" data-type="indexterm" id="id343"/>enable Pulse, navigate to the site settings. In the General section, you’ll be given the option to turn it on for all users within a site or a single specified group of users. This configuration section includes some info on what Pulse does and explains that it is currently being updated on a frequent (biweekly) basis. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_1_1732595607634526">Figure 2-1</a> shows where to enable Pulse.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>To have access to the Settings section in<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Settings section, Tableau Cloud" data-type="indexterm" id="id344"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Cloud" data-secondary="Settings section" data-type="indexterm" id="id345"/> Tableau Cloud, you must have <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Site administrator permissions, Tableau Cloud" data-type="indexterm" id="id346"/>site administrator permissions. This means your license role must be either a Site Administrator Creator or Site Administrator Explorer.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In addition to enabling Pulse on your site, you must have at least one published data source to generate a metric. A <em>published data source</em> is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="published data source" data-type="indexterm" id="id347"/>a standalone object in Tableau that represents a data set for a specific analysis. Inclusive of a published data source are the following components:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Data connection</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The credentials, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data connections" data-type="indexterm" id="id348"/>connection information, and relationship (joins) between data tables used in the data set. This information is all packaged up so that each subsequent user doesn’t have to redo this work.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Field customizations and defaults</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Fields <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="fields, in data set" data-type="indexterm" id="id349"/>in the data set can be refined to have friendly field names (as opposed to the names in their source systems), number format, default colors, default aggregations, and definitions. Unnecessary fields can be hidden from end users, yielding them unavailable for analysis. These all define the default behavior of how a field will be used when constructing visualizations.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt class="less_space pagebreak-before">Added fields for analysis</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>New calculations based on the underlying data can be constructed (imagine having Sales and Cost of Goods—Profit would be the mathematical difference between those two). Additionally, new dimensions and analytical tools like bins, sets, and parameters can be included.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Data freshness</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Specifications <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data freshness" data-type="indexterm" id="id350"/>as to whether the data source is connected live to the source system or extracted and refreshed on a specific schedule. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="extracts, data" data-type="indexterm" id="id351"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data extracts" data-type="indexterm" id="id352"/>An <em>extract</em> is a snapshot of the data from the source system, which can be given a frequency for the system to retrieve new/updated data.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Description and certification</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>These include a user-friendly description on what is included in the data set; typical descriptions include the source systems and how the data source can be used for analysis. A <em>certification</em> badge <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="certification badge" data-type="indexterm" id="id353"/>can also be applied, which links the username of the person who certified the data and an optional message with information about the certification status.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Permissions</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Since it is a standalone object, the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="permissions" data-type="indexterm" id="id354"/>permissions for who can access, modify, and delete a published data source must be set.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The purpose of a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="published data source" data-secondary="purpose of" data-type="indexterm" id="id355"/>published data source is to be <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="single source of truth, published data source as" data-type="indexterm" id="id356"/>a <em>single source of truth</em> for a particular scope of analysis. Its key benefit is the knowledge that each subsequent analysis, visualization, and metric are functioning off the same underlying data. Additionally, a published data source minimizes data-source proliferation and unnecessarily redundant connections to the same data in source systems. In a very mature Tableau environment, you can imagine that one published data source can fuel a whole body of analytical content (multiple dashboards, ad hoc analyses, and metrics).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>All Pulse metrics must be constructed from fields in a published data source. Data sources that are embedded within a workbook will not be accessible to create a metric.</p>&#13;

<h2>Metric Definitions and Metrics</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Up to this <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="metric definitions in" data-type="indexterm" id="id357"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="metric definitions, in Pulse" data-type="indexterm" id="id358"/>point, I’ve been calling the measurements available for following in Pulse <em>metrics</em>. While this is true, there are actually two subconcepts of metrics I’d like to unpack. First is the <em>metric definition</em>, which is the metadata specified for a metric and includes the following:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Name</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The user-friendly name given to the metric, like <em>Sales</em></p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Measure and aggregation</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The numerical field being used to generate the metric and the aggregation (like sum/min/max) that is applied to it</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Time dimension</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Each metric <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="time dimension" data-type="indexterm" id="id359"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="time dimension" data-type="indexterm" id="id360"/>needs a date or datetime dimension for time-bound comparisons, another field in the data set</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Compared to</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>A configuration on the interval of time for time-bound comparisons, like prior year, month, or week</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Adjustable metric filters</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>These <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="adjustable metric filters" data-type="indexterm" id="id361"/>are (likely categorical) dimension fields that can be added as filters to limit the metric results by end users</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Number format</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>How the numerical value should be represented, like as currency or percentage</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Value going up is</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>A specification as to whether an increase in the value is favorable or unfavorable</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You, the analytics professional, will be responsible for specifying metric definitions. Depending on the size of your organization or the scope of your role, you will likely be creating the published data source that feeds the definition as well.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>All metric definitions must be unique in Tableau Pulse. If a user attempts to create an identical metric definition from the same data source, an error will appear when they try to save the definition. Within the error message is a link to the existing identical metric definition.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The second subconcept is a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="metrics in" data-type="indexterm" id="id362"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="metrics, Pulse" data-type="indexterm" id="id363"/>metric itself. This is a <em>visual representation</em> of the metric definition that can include the application of the filters and time comparisons that were instantiated in the definition. Say, for example, you construct a sales metric that allows an end user to filter by region and set the time range for display. If there are four regions in your data, you can imagine that there could be four iterations of the metric, one for each region. Similarly, there can be metrics for different time intervals chosen (like this year, this month).</p>&#13;

<h1>Your First Pulse Metric</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s create a metric from the beginning. I’ll walk you through generating a published data source, metric definition, and subsequent metrics using the Sample - Superstore data set that comes packaged with Tableau. After I go through the creation process, I’ll do a deep dive on the windows, menus, and configurations seen along the way.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>What is the Sample - Superstore data set? It is sample data from a fictional retail store that sells a variety of products, mostly things you would find in an office. Each row of data within the Superstore data set represents a line item on a receipt. Imagine you purchased two binders, three mousepads, and one bottle of water. There would be three records (rows) for your transaction, one for each unique product, which include the quantity of each. You would also see the order number repeated for each of these three records, since they were all purchased within the same transaction.</p>&#13;

<h2>Building a Published Data Source</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To build <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="metrics, Pulse" data-secondary="creating" data-tertiary="building published data source" data-type="indexterm" id="kab010"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="metrics in, creating" data-tertiary="building published data source" data-type="indexterm" id="kab011"/>a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="published data source" data-secondary="building" data-type="indexterm" id="kab012"/>published data source, you must first connect to data. Published data sources can be made in Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep Builder, and Tableau Cloud. Here’s how you can construct a published data source in <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Desktop" data-secondary="constructing published data source using" data-type="indexterm" id="kab023"/>Tableau Desktop. First connect to the Excel file that includes the Sample - Superstore data. For default Tableau installations, this file can be found in subfolders within the My Tableau Repository folder found in your Documents folder. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_2_1732595607634559">Figure 2-2</a> shows where it is located on my Mac.</p>&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-2. </span>Location of Sample - Superstore data within My Tableau Repository</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">After selecting the <em>Sample - Superstore.xls</em> file, you’re automatically taken to the Data Source screen to both preview the data and construct relationships among additional data sources or the tables contained within. Superstore has three tables associated with it: Orders, People, and Returns. For the sake of simplicity, you can skip relating tables and instead work exclusively with the Orders table. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_3_1732595607634583">Figure 2-3</a> shows the Data Source screen after the Orders table has been dragged into the center.</p>&#13;

</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>From here, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Data Source area, Tableau Desktop" data-type="indexterm" id="id364"/>navigate to Sheet 1. This will give you access to the Data pane, which is the area on the left side of the canvas that shows all the fields in the data set. The Data pane also includes a few prebuilt fields, denoted by italics, that Tableau includes for ease of use. You can see this in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_4_1732595607634605">Figure 2-4</a>.</p>&#13;

</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>At this point, you can begin preparing your data set for analysis. Remember, the goal of this process is to make a data source that can feed many types of analysis. You want to construct something that allows other users to quickly understand each of the fields and be able to use it for their own analyses. To assist in the process, you can make the following modifications and additions:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ol class="less_space pagebreak-before">&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Default aggregation and number format for Discount. The Discount field represents a percentage value that was given as a discount off the sticker price of an item. Right-click this field and navigate to the Default Properties section to set the default Number Format for the field to Percentage with 2 decimals. Set the Aggregation to Average, since you don’t want users summing up the percentage points of discount. You can see this menu in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_5_1732595607634626">Figure 2-5</a>.</p>&#13;
	&#13;

		</div></figure>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Next, create a <em>hierarchy</em>, a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hierarchies, creating" data-type="indexterm" id="id365"/>way to organize dimensions into a parent-child relationship, for the geographic data included in the data set. To do this, drag one field on top of another in the Data pane and organize them from least granular geographic field (Country/Region) to most granular (Postal Code). You can also include the Region field, which is a value assigned by the organization.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li class="less_space pagebreak-before">&#13;
	<p>Similar to defining the default properties of a field, you can assign the Region field a Geographic Role. This is done by selecting the “Create from” option and choosing the State/Province field.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Set the default number format for both Profit and Sales to be Currency <span class="keep-together">(Standard)</span>.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Hide the Row ID field from use. This is an internal field generated by the Superstore database and isn’t used in analysis.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Finally, you can add descriptions to a few fields—namely, Segment, Category, Order Date, and Ship Date. These fields are often confused within the organization, so adding a description (called a <em>comment</em>) will help guide anyone working with the data set. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_6_1732595607634645">Figure 2-6</a> shows the description I’ve added for Segment.</p>&#13;

</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Now that you’ve customized and refined the data source, it’s time to publish <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Cloud" data-secondary="publishing data source to" data-type="indexterm" id="id366"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data source, publishing to Tableau Cloud" data-type="indexterm" id="id367"/>it up to Tableau Cloud. There are many ways to do this, but I’ll walk you through my preferred method. Right-click the name of the Data Source in the Data pane. From here, select Publish to Server. A subsequent window pops up, shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_7_1732595607634665">Figure 2-7</a>, where you can customize the published data source.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>Once the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Publish to Server menu" data-type="indexterm" id="id368"/>data source is published, a new window will open in your internet browser showing the location of the published data source in the Tableau Cloud environment, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_8_1732595607634683">Figure 2-8</a>.

<p>Now you’ll complete this example by constructing a metric for the “Director of the Corporate” segment. At Superstore, each sales channel is managed by independent verticals, so the “Director of Corporate Sales” isn’t interested in the other two segments within Superstore.

<p>You’ve now seen a basic build of a published data source, metric definition, and metric. But as you may have noticed, more in-depth customizations and configurations can be made along the way. So the next section steps away from a specific metric and describes in more detail each of the configuration options available in the metric definition. Any configurations not covered in this chapter are discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03_advanced_tableau_pulse_features_1732595608107486">Chapter 3</a>, as those are more <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="metrics in" data-startref="kab018" data-tertiary="interacting with" data-type="indexterm" id="id393"/>advanced <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="metrics, Pulse" data-secondary="interacting with" data-startref="kab017" data-type="indexterm" id="id394"/>features.</p>&#13;

	<dd>&#13;
	<p>This is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Name field, Definition menu" data-type="indexterm" id="id399"/>the name you give your metric definition. Ideally, this explains what the core definition is trying to measure. The red asterisk next to each configuration option denotes it is a required field.</p>&#13;

This becomes more apparent when a user follows multiple metrics and receives summaries of all their followed metrics in addition to individual insights for metrics. Additionally, this scoring system is influenced by the thumbs up/down feedback from a user on the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="metric definitions in" data-startref="kab019" data-type="indexterm" id="id431"/>deeper insights that surface.</p>&#13;

<h1>Summary</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You’ve now learned everything necessary to create your first Pulse metric and have a thorough understanding of the configuration options available. Here are some key takeaways:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>A published data source is required for building a Pulse metric.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>A published data source is a standalone object in Tableau that holds key information about a data set for analysis. It includes source system connection information, credentials, default settings (like formatting and descriptions), and additional fields added for analysis.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>A metric definition includes the measure field name, aggregation, time dimension, filterable dimensions, and insights available for all subsequent metrics.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>A metric is the interactive visualization and summaries based on a metric <span class="keep-together">definition</span>.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Users can customize metrics based on the available filterable dimensions and preferred time ranges. Each configuration is saved as an additional metric that can then be followed.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Metrics can be followed by a user or a user group and show up in each user’s Pulse Summary.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Many insight types can be applied to a metric definition. Most of them can be turned on or off based on the creator’s preferences.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03_advanced_tableau_pulse_features_1732595608107486">Chapter 3</a> explores advanced options within Pulse in more detail. You’ll learn how to add definition filters, make advanced changes to time, and create an advanced metric definition. It also unpacks how calculated fields can be used in metric definitions. Finally, you’ll learn how to manage permissions and metrics in the Tableau platform.</p>&#13;
