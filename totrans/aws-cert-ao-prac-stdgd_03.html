<h1><span class="label">Chapter 2. </span>AWS Fundamentals for the AI Practitioner</h1>
<p>The 2006 launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS) <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS (Amazon Web Services)" data-secondary="fundamentals" data-tertiary="about AWS" id="id506"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fundamentals of AWS" data-secondary="about AWS" id="id507"/>was a direct result of internal challenges at Amazon. The company’s codebase and data systems had become massive and complex, making them <a href="https://oreil.ly/SGSgQ">difficult to change and maintain</a>. To continue scaling its growth, Amazon needed a significant architectural change.</p>
<p>CEO Jeff Bezos prioritized a <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Bezos, Jeff" id="id508"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="microservice architecture of AWS" id="id509"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="architecture of AWS" id="id510"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS (Amazon Web Services)" data-secondary="fundamentals" data-tertiary="microservices architecture" id="id511"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="scalability" data-secondary="microservice architecture of AWS" id="id512"/>complete overhaul of the company’s information technology (IT) infrastructure. The strategy involved breaking the monolithic codebase into smaller, independent components called <em>microservices</em>. Each microservice would handle a specific task, such as authentication, storage, or database updates. This approach enabled smaller, more agile developer teams, leading to faster development cycles—a concept famously embodied by the “two-pizza rule,” where teams were small enough to be fed with just two pizzas.</p>
<p>A critical part of this transformation was creating a shared services platform to simplify and automate time-consuming tasks like load balancing and data center management. This platform allowed developers to provision services easily without managing the complex underlying infrastructure, freeing them to focus on coding, debugging, and deployment.</p>
<p>This internal platform became the foundation for AWS. Bezos realized that many other companies could benefit from this model, offering it to customers with an affordable pay-as-you-go pricing structure. AWS was an immediate success, particularly with startups, and eventually attracted larger enterprise customers. Today, AWS is a dominant force in the technology industry, <a href="https://oreil.ly/cCH4T">serving millions of customers</a> and driving a majority of Amazon’s operating income.</p>
<p>This chapter provides an overview of AWS and its core services. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="exam for AIF-C01" data-secondary="topics covered" data-tertiary="AWS fundamentals" id="id513"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="topics covered in exam for AIF-C01" data-secondary="AWS fundamentals" id="id514"/>Although the AIF-C01 exam focuses on AI, it includes questions on fundamental AWS concepts.</p>
<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Cloud Computing"><div class="sect1" id="cloud_computing">
<h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
<p>Even though cloud computing<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloud computing" id="id515"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS (Amazon Web Services)" data-secondary="fundamentals" data-tertiary="cloud computing" id="id516"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fundamentals of AWS" data-secondary="cloud computing" id="id517"/> has been around for many years, the concept can still be fuzzy. Part of this is due to the pace of innovation in the industry. But another factor is the sheer number of capabilities, functions, and use cases for cloud computing. For example, there are the enterprise services from platforms like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google. Then there are the many applications, such as iCloud, Google Drive, and Microsoft’s OneDrive.</p>
<p>Yes, it seems that the cloud is everywhere.</p>
<p>But for the purposes of the AIF-C01 exam, it’s important to get a good definition of cloud computing. So let’s see how AWS <a href="https://oreil.ly/Wx53r">defines</a> it:<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloud computing" data-secondary="defined" id="id518"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s break this down. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS (Amazon Web Services)" data-secondary="Management Console" data-tertiary="cloud computing services" id="id519"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS Management Console" data-secondary="cloud computing services" id="id520"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="command-line interface (CLI)" data-secondary="cloud computing services" id="id521"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="software development kit (SDK)" data-secondary="cloud computing services" id="id522"/>First, cloud computing is on-demand, which means that you can access computing services whenever you want. This is done through the AWS Management Console, the command-line interface (CLI), or a software development kit (SDK).</p>
<p>These computing services<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="virtualization of cloud computing services" id="id523"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloud computing" data-secondary="virtualization of services" id="id524"/> are virtualized. This is where physical hardware, like a server, is shared by multiple users. This is done by using sophisticated technologies like hypervisors and containerization, which allow for more efficient and effective usage of IT resources. These essentially create isolated environments, with their own operating systems. This makes it seem like you have your own dedicated system, which you can configure for your requirements.</p>
<p>Here are other advantages of cloud computing:<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloud computing" data-secondary="advantages of" id="id525"/></p>
<dl>
<dt>Lower costs</dt>
<dd><p>With AWS, you don’t need<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="costs" data-secondary="cloud computing lower costs" id="id526"/> to invest in costly physical infrastructure like servers, storage, and networking equipment. Instead, you can launch virtual machines using Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) and only pay for the computing power you actually use. This pay-as-you-go model eliminates hefty upfront capital expenses and reduces ongoing maintenance costs.</p></dd>
<dt>Scalability</dt>
<dd><p>AWS offers virtually limitless scalability.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="scalability" data-secondary="cloud computing advantage" id="id527"/> For instance, an ecommerce site can use AWS Auto Scaling to automatically add or remove Amazon EC2 instances based on traffic patterns. This means your application can easily handle sudden spikes in demand without manual intervention or system delays.</p></dd>
<dt>Global footprint</dt>
<dd><p>AWS operates data centers<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="latency" data-secondary="AWS global data centers" id="id528"/> in regions across the world. Services like Amazon CloudFront (AWS’s content delivery network) allow a video streaming platform to deliver content from edge locations near users, resulting in lower latency and faster load times, no matter where your customers are located.</p></dd>
<dt>High availability</dt>
<dd><p>AWS is designed for minimal downtime.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="high availability" id="id529"/> Features such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) Multi-AZ deployments provide automatic failover support, so your database remains available even if one availability zone goes down. With built-in redundancy, backup systems, and monitoring, AWS ensures your applications stay online.</p></dd>
<dt>Security</dt>
<dd><p>Security is a core component<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="AWS cloud computing" id="id530"/> of AWS’s infrastructure. Tools like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enable fine-grained control over who can access specific resources. Combined with robust encryption, firewalls, and continuous updates from top-tier security experts, AWS helps you protect sensitive data and stay compliant.</p></dd>
<dt>Innovation</dt>
<dd><p>By offloading infrastructure management to AWS, your teams can focus on higher-value tasks like building new applications or enhancing customer experiences. Cloud services remove the burden of provisioning and managing hardware, allowing for faster experimentation and innovation.</p></dd>

<h1>Cloud Models</h1>
<p>There are three models for cloud computing:<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloud computing" data-secondary="cloud models" data-tertiary="about" id="id531"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS (Amazon Web Services)" data-secondary="fundamentals" data-tertiary="cloud models" id="c02clmo"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fundamentals of AWS" data-secondary="cloud computing" data-tertiary="cloud models" id="c02clmo2"/></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Public cloud</p></li>
<li><p>Private cloud</p></li>
<li><p>Hybrid cloud</p></li>
</ul>
<p>None is necessarily better than another. Rather, each serves different types of requirements. Let’s discuss all three in the following sections.</p>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Public Cloud"><div class="sect2" id="public_cloud">
<h2>Public Cloud</h2>
<p>The public cloud is the most common.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloud computing" data-secondary="cloud models" data-tertiary="public cloud" id="id532"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="public cloud model" id="id533"/> It is what’s at the core of AWS, as well as Microsoft’s Azure and the Google Cloud Service. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="public cloud model" data-secondary="multi-tenant model" id="id534"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="multi-tenant model of public cloud" id="id535"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="costs" data-secondary="public cloud" id="id536"/>The cloud provider builds and maintains the infrastructure and compute resources. These are then shared among the customers, which is called the <em>multi-tenant model</em>. This allows for more efficiency and lower costs.</p>
<p>However, the multi-tenant model does have drawbacks. You are relying on a third party for critical operations. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="public cloud" id="id537"/>There is also the concern about security. Then again, AWS does have strong systems in place for this, such as with IAM, encryption, and System and Organization Controls (SOC) compliance. They also have 24/7 monitoring of its infrastructure.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Private Cloud"><div class="sect2" id="private_cloud">
<h2>Private Cloud</h2>
<p>The private cloud uses the<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloud computing" data-secondary="cloud models" data-tertiary="private cloud" id="id538"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="private cloud model" id="id539"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="single-tenant model of private cloud" id="id540"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="private cloud model" data-secondary="single-tenant model" id="id541"/> single-tenant model. This means that an organization builds and manages its own IT infrastructure. Depending on the arrangement, this may mean that it owns its own data centers or leases them from a third party. Regardless, the organization remains in complete control of the operations.</p>
<p>This has several advantages. One is that the private cloud can be customized. An example is that an organization can use it for specialized operations, say for an automated warehouse that needs to have low latency.</p>
<p>A private cloud is often<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="private cloud" id="id542"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="compliance" data-secondary="private cloud model" id="id543"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="privacy" data-secondary="private cloud model" id="id544"/> the option for regulated industries, such as in healthcare and financial services. They need high levels of security, compliance, and privacy. A security breach could result in expensive lawsuits and damage to a company’s brand. In light of this, the private cloud is often the best approach.</p>
<p>AWS provides various services for private clouds. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="private cloud model" data-secondary="Amazon Virtual Private Cloud" id="id545"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)" id="id546"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="on-premises" data-secondary="Amazon Virtual Private Cloud" id="id547"/>An example is the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), which allows for launching AWS resources in an on-premises environment.</p>
<p>Then what about the drawbacks of the private cloud? <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="costs" data-secondary="private cloud" id="id548"/>The main one is the cost. Of course, you’ll need to buy and maintain hardware, which can quickly become obsolete. You’ll also need a staff of IT professionals to manage the infrastructure.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Hybrid Cloud"><div class="sect2" id="hybrid_cloud">
<h2>Hybrid Cloud</h2>
<p>The hybrid cloud blends the <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloud computing" data-secondary="cloud models" data-tertiary="hybrid cloud" id="id549"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="hybrid cloud model" id="id550"/>public cloud with the private cloud. This provides for sharing of data and applications among the two platforms. This may also include multicloud environments. This is where an organization uses more than one public cloud system, which can allow for more redundancy. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="on-premises" data-secondary="hybrid clouds" id="id551"/>Yet there is still an on-premises environment.</p>
<p>Sounds complex? It certainly is. These implementations require sophisticated IT expertise.</p>
<p>But AWS provides numerous tools to help out. Let’s look at one now: <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="hybrid cloud model" data-secondary="AWS Outposts" id="id552"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS Outposts for hybrid cloud model" id="id553"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="on-premises" data-secondary="AWS Outposts" id="id554"/>AWS Outposts lets you operate AWS infrastructure for on-premises environments that allow for seamless experiences. For example, a company can develop and test applications on the cloud system—which is more affordable—and then deploy them in the private cloud.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="hybrid cloud model" data-secondary="growth strong" id="id555"/> the growth of the hybrid cloud market has been strong. According to research from <a href="https://oreil.ly/lIWqv">SkyQuest Technology</a>, the category is supposed to go from $97.8 billion in 2023 to $348.14 billion by 2031.</p>

<h1>Cloud Service Types</h1>
<p>The phrase <em>as a service</em> is certainly<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloud computing" data-secondary="cloud service types" id="c02cldtyp"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS (Amazon Web Services)" data-secondary="fundamentals" data-tertiary="cloud service types" id="c02cldtyp2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fundamentals of AWS" data-secondary="cloud computing" data-tertiary="cloud service types" id="c02cldtyp3"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloud computing" data-secondary="cloud service types" data-tertiary="about" id="id565"/> pervasive. It applies to seemingly any type of IT service. Some examples include storage as a service (STaaS), monitoring as a service (MaaS), and artificial intelligence as a service (AIaaS).</p>
<p>If anything, the concept has become a key part of the marketing playbooks of many software companies. It’s also susceptible to considerable hype.</p>
<p>Regardless, the concept of “as a service” is fairly straightforward. It’s about renting or leasing an IT service—not owning it. That is, you generally agree to a subscription. You also can usually cancel at any time, for any reason. This flexibility has been a big driver for the popularity of “as a service” solutions.</p>
<p>But the market is highly competitive. This is why there are often sweeteners and promotions. For example, AWS may offer a big discount if you are willing to sign up for a commitment of a year or more.</p>
<p>As for the cloud, there are three types of “as a service” flavors, which are also known as cloud service types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</p></li>
<li><p>Platform as a service (PaaS)</p></li>
<li><p>Software as a service (SaaS)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a more detailed look at the cloud service types and what AWS provides.</p>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Infrastructure as a Service"><div class="sect2" id="infrastructure_as_a_service_left_parent">
<h2>Infrastructure as a Service</h2>
<p>IaaS is<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloud computing" data-secondary="cloud service types" data-tertiary="infrastructure as a service" id="id566"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="infrastructure as a service (IaaS)" id="id567"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="IaaS (infrastructure as a service)" id="id568"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="virtual machines (VMs)" id="id569"/> about the core IT resources of a cloud platform. These include virtual machines (VMs), storage, and networking. They are all virtualized services.</p>
<p>A VM is at the heart of IaaS. It’s essentially a software-based version of a physical computer or server. It’s as if you have access to a dedicated machine. It has its own OS, applications, and hardware, such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking.</p>
<p>In AWS, the VM is called an EC2.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)" data-secondary="virtual machines of AWS" id="id570"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="virtual machines (VMs)" data-secondary="Amazon EC2" id="id571"/> To see how it works, let’s look at an example. Suppose you are leading a team that is developing a new ecommerce application, and there needs to be a testing environment. With AWS, you can quickly spin up the necessary infrastructure for this by creating an EC2 instance. Setting this up is a matter of filling out a form.</p>
<p>After you finish the configuration for the EC2 instance, AWS will create it within a few minutes. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="costs" data-secondary="infrastructure as a service" id="id572"/>By comparison, if you did this on your own, it could have easily taken hours—assuming you have skills with IT infrastructure—and cost thousands of <span class="keep-together">dollars.</span></p>
<p>But IaaS has drawbacks:</p>
<dl>
<dt>IT expertise</dt>
<dd><p>You need a skilled team to manage tasks like OS updates, security patches, and resource optimization. They will also need to do system monitoring and handle security. That said, AWS does provide extensive documentation and has a professional services unit to help its customers.</p></dd>
<dt>Cost management</dt>
<dd><p>The pay-as-you-go model <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="costs" data-secondary="infrastructure as a service" data-tertiary="pay-as-you-go model" id="id573"/>can sometimes result in unexpected expenses, such as those due to overprovisioning of services. When using IaaS, there needs to be strong monitoring of costs.</p></dd>
<dt>Vendor lock-in</dt>
<dd><p>Migrating from one IaaS provider to another can be expensive and time-consuming. This is why there should be strong vetting when evaluating a <span class="keep-together">provider.</span></p></dd>
</dl>
</div></section>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Platform as a Service"><div class="sect2" id="platform_as_a_service_left_parenthesisp">
<h2>Platform as a Service</h2>
<p>PaaS includes<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloud computing" data-secondary="cloud service types" data-tertiary="platform as a service" id="c02paas"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="platform as a service (PaaS)" id="c02paas2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="PaaS (platform as a service)" id="c02paas3"/> the infrastructure of IaaS. But there is also middleware, which is the software that operates between the OS and the applications. These are application servers, database management systems, messaging applications, and authentication. PaaS will allow for the communication between these services.</p>
<p>Besides middleware, there are other services provided. You get access to development tools, like IDEs, as well as data encryption, load balancing, automated updates, monitoring, and analytics.</p>
<p>Some of the key advantages for PaaS include the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Focus</dt>
<dd><p>Without the need for managing infrastructure and backend resources, developers can devote more time to building applications.</p></dd>
<dt>Costs</dt>
<dd><p>The expenses tend to<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="costs" data-secondary="platform as a service" id="id574"/> be lower than IaaS, since there is no need to pay for licenses for numerous software applications. You also do not need specific staff for infrastructure management and updates.</p></dd>
<dt>Full-fledged development platform</dt>
<dd><p>PaaS provides tools to help streamline the lifecycle, including building, testing, managing, and updating applications. This is all done in the same integrated environment.</p></dd>
<dt>Analytics</dt>
<dd><p>This helps to test and monitor applications. This can provide for forecasting, evaluating return on investment (ROI), and improving the product design. Analytics tools also can benefit from sophisticated AI technologies.</p></dd>
<dt>Data integration</dt>
<dd><p>PaaS can allow for real-time data operations among applications, say with enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms. This allows teams to get accurate and up-to-date information to make better decisions.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>To better see how PaaS compares to IaaS,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon SageMaker" data-secondary="SageMaker JumpStart" id="id575"/> let’s look at an example of a PaaS service in AWS, which is called SageMaker JumpStart (we’ll cover this in more depth in this book). With this tool, you can streamline the process of creating an AI application by selecting a pretrained model and integrating it within an application via API calls.</p>
<p>However, if you used the IaaS approach, the process would be much more detailed. You would need to manually provision EC2 instances, install software like Python and machine learning libraries, and configure the environment for your model. This includes setting up APIs for model inference, managing security groups, and handling load balancing. Ongoing maintenance tasks, such as applying security patches and monitoring system health, are also your responsibility. While this approach offers greater control and customization, it requires significant effort to manage and maintain the infrastructure.</p>
<p>This is not to imply that PaaS is better than IaaS. Rather, each approach is based on your requirements. If you want much more control over your resources, then IaaS is the best option. But if you do not have the resources or need for this level of control, then PaaS should be fine.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="02paas" id="id576"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="02paas2" id="id577"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="02paas3" id="id578"/></p>

<p>Usually, these services are accessed from a web browser. But it is becoming more common for there to be versions for the desktop.</p>
<p>In many cases, the pricing model is based on subscriptions per user. This could be on a monthly or annual basis (for this, there is often a discount for making a one- or two-year commitment).</p>
<p>AWS provides a variety of SaaS applications for helping with business operations. Here are some examples:</p>

<h1>AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones</h1>
<p>AWS’s global cloud infrastructure is organized into three main categories:<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS (Amazon Web Services)" data-secondary="global cloud infrastructure" id="id595"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloud computing" data-secondary="AWS global cloud infrastructure" id="id596"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fundamentals of AWS" data-secondary="global cloud infrastructure" id="id597"/></p>
<ul>
<li><p>AWS regions</p></li>
<li><p>Availability zones</p></li>
<li><p>Local zones</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Organizing infrastructure into intentional categories allows AWS to bolster high availability, provide disaster recovery, address low latency, optimize security, and charge lower fees.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at each.</p>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Region"><div class="sect2" id="region">
<h2>Region</h2>
<p>A region represents a specific<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS (Amazon Web Services)" data-secondary="global cloud infrastructure" data-tertiary="regions" id="id598"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloud computing" data-secondary="AWS global cloud infrastructure" data-tertiary="regions" id="id599"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="regions of AWS global cloud infrastructure" id="id600"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fundamentals of AWS" data-secondary="global cloud infrastructure" data-tertiary="regions" id="id601"/> geographic area. Currently, AWS is divided into 36 regions across the globe, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#figure_two_onedot_aws_regions_across_th">Figure 2-1</a>. But this number usually increases every year.</p>
<figure><div id="figure_two_onedot_aws_regions_across_th" class="figure">

<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-1. </span>AWS regions across the globe</h6>
</div></figure>
<p>A region has a name that is based on the location. For example, “us-east-1” is for the main US East region, and “eu-central-1” is for central Europe. Each region is isolated from the others, which allows for much more stability, as when there is a power outage or malfunction.</p>
<p>When selecting a region, these are some factors to think about (you are not restricted to a region that you or your business lives in):</p>
<dl>
<dt>Proximity to users</dt>
<dd><p>Having a closer region can help to speed up delivery of the content. It can also help to lower costs.</p></dd>
<dt>Compliance</dt>
<dd><p>In certain countries, you may have data residency requirements. This means the data cannot leave the geographical bounds. For example, suppose this is the case for a healthcare company based in Australia. They will need to use the “ap-southeast-2” region to be in compliance.</p></dd>
<dt>Available services</dt>
<dd><p>A closer region may not have the AWS services you need.</p></dd>
<dt>Costs</dt>
<dd><p>The pricing can vary from one region to another. This may also include the impact of taxes in certain countries.</p></dd>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Availability Zones"><div class="sect2" id="availability_zones">
<h2>Availability Zones</h2>
<p>For AWS, each region has<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS (Amazon Web Services)" data-secondary="global cloud infrastructure" data-tertiary="availability zones" id="id602"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="regions of AWS global cloud infrastructure" data-secondary="availability zones" id="id603"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="availability zones (AZs)" id="id604"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AZs (availability zones)" id="id605"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fundamentals of AWS" data-secondary="global cloud infrastructure" data-tertiary="availability zones" id="id606"/> at least three availability zones (AZs), which include multiple data centers (there are 114 centers currently). The number of data centers changes as AWS continues to expand.</p>
<p>An AZ has its own cooling power and physical security. Then there are connections using ultra-low-latency networks. To further improve latency, the AZs are located tens of miles from each other. This is generally enough to mitigate the likelihood of several of them being impacted by an outage or disaster. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="availability zones" id="id607"/>However, if you have the need for high levels of security, you can run applications across more than one AZ.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Local Zones"><div class="sect2" id="local_zones">
<h2>Local Zones</h2>
<p>A local zone is within a region.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS (Amazon Web Services)" data-secondary="global cloud infrastructure" data-tertiary="local zones" id="id608"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="regions of AWS global cloud infrastructure" data-secondary="local zones" id="id609"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="local zones" id="id610"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="latency" data-secondary="local zones" id="id611"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fundamentals of AWS" data-secondary="global cloud infrastructure" data-tertiary="local zones" id="id612"/> It allows for services to be closer to users. This is for applications that need extremely low latency, such as for streaming media, gaming, virtual reality (VR), and AI.</p>
<p>A local zone can also be effective for data residency, as well with running hybrid cloud environments.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Pricing Models"><div class="sect1" id="pricing_models">
<h1>Pricing Models</h1>
<p>AWS provides numerous pricing models:<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS (Amazon Web Services)" data-secondary="fundamentals" data-tertiary="model prices" id="id613"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fundamentals of AWS" data-secondary="model prices" id="id614"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="costs" data-secondary="AWS pricing models" id="id615"/></p>
<dl>
<dt>On-Demand Instances</dt>
<dd><p>These offer the flexibility to pay for compute capacity by the second (with a minimum of 60 seconds), without any long-term commitments. This model is for applications with unpredictable workloads or those that cannot be interrupted, such as short-term projects, testing new applications, or handling unexpected traffic spikes. For instance, if you’re developing a new feature and need to test it across different environments, on-demand instances provide the agility to scale resources up or down as needed without up-front costs.</p></dd>
<dt>Savings plans</dt>
<dd><p>These provide significant cost savings—up to 72%—in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a one- or three-year term. There are two types: Compute Savings Plans offer flexibility across instance families and regions, while Amazon EC2 Instance Savings Plans apply to specific instance families within a region. These plans are suitable for applications with steady-state usage, such as web servers or backend services, where you can predict your compute needs over time. For example, if your company runs a customer-facing application with consistent traffic, committing to a savings plan can lead to substantial cost reductions.</p></dd>
<dt>Dedicated Hosts</dt>
<dd><p>Dedicated Hosts provide physical servers fully dedicated to your use, allowing you to use your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses, including Windows Server and Microsoft SQL Server. This can help reduce costs and meet compliance requirements. They’re for applications that require a single-tenant environment, such as those with strict regulatory or licensing requirements. For example, if you’re migrating legacy applications that are licensed per core, dedicated hosts enable you to maintain compliance while leveraging AWS infrastructure.</p></dd>
<dt>Spot Instances</dt>
<dd><p>These allow you to leverage unused Amazon EC2 capacity at discounts of up to 90% compared to on-demand prices. However, these instances can be reclaimed by AWS with a two-minute warning, making them best suited for fault-tolerant and flexible applications. Common use cases include batch processing, big data analysis, and continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. For instance, if you’re running large-scale data analysis jobs that can handle interruptions, Spot Instances can provide significant cost savings.</p></dd>

</ul>
<p>To understand how they work together, let’s imagine you are working for a rapidly growing ecommerce startup. The CEO wants to build a real-time analytics and recommendation system to improve the customer experience and drive sales. The system will need to ingest and process large volumes of data from various sources, analyze user behavior, and provide personalized product recommendations.</p>
<p>Let’s go through an analytics pipeline and discuss the tools that will be used.</p>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Data Ingestion"><div class="sect2" id="data_ingestion">
<h2>Data Ingestion</h2>
<p>To begin the analytics pipeline,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS (Amazon Web Services)" data-secondary="core services" data-tertiary="data ingestion" id="id623"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fundamentals of AWS" data-secondary="core services" data-tertiary="data ingestion" id="id624"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ecommerce example using AWS services" data-secondary="data ingestion" id="id625"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="data ingestion" id="id626"/> the system collects data from both real-time and batch sources to provide a comprehensive view of user activity and business context. Real-time data—such as clicks, page views, and purchase events—is streamed from the company’s website and mobile app <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Kinesis" id="id627"/>using Amazon Kinesis, which enables high-throughput, low-latency data ingestion.</p>
<p>In parallel, <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)" id="id628"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="storage" data-tertiary="Amazon S3" id="id629"/>batch data—such as product catalog updates, inventory levels, and customer demographic information—is uploaded to Amazon S3, which serves as the central storage for the system. Amazon S3 organizes data into buckets and supports metadata tagging, making it easier to manage, query, and classify information. With 99.999999999% durability, Amazon S3 ensures that data is reliably stored across multiple devices and facilities within an AWS region. The service offers virtually unlimited scalability and a wide range of storage classes. This allows a company to optimize cost and performance based on data usage patterns. For example, frequently accessed files can reside in Amazon S3 Standard, while less commonly used data may be placed in Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering or Glacier for cost efficiency. Amazon S3 also provides fine-grained security through bucket policies, access control lists, and encryption.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Data Processing"><div class="sect2" id="data_processing-id000021">
<h2>Data Processing</h2>
<p>Once the data is ingested,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS (Amazon Web Services)" data-secondary="core services" data-tertiary="data processing" id="id630"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fundamentals of AWS" data-secondary="core services" data-tertiary="data processing" id="id631"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ecommerce example using AWS services" data-secondary="data processing" id="id632"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data processing" id="id633"/> it must be processed and prepared for analysis—a step that ensures the information is clean, consistent, and ready to power analytics and personalization. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS Lambda" data-secondary="data processing" id="id634"/>For real-time streaming data ingested through Kinesis, Lambda is used to automatically trigger functions that perform tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, and enrichment. Lambda is a serverless compute service. This means AWS handles the infrastructure, scaling, and availability behind the scenes. Developers simply upload their code—in languages like Python, Node.js, Java, or Go—and Lambda runs it in response to events. It scales automatically based on traffic, and users are only charged for the number of requests and the compute time used. Lambda’s flexible architecture, combined with its generous free tier, makes it an efficient and cost-effective way to process large volumes of real-time data on the fly.</p>
<p>For batch data that resides in Amazon S3,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS Glue" id="id635"/> processing is handled by AWS Glue, a fully managed serverless extract, transform, load (ETL) service designed for preparing data for analytics and machine learning workloads. AWS Glue integrates with over 100 data sources and offers a centralized environment where users can create, run, and monitor ETL pipelines using both code and visual interfaces. It automates much of the heavy lifting associated with data prep—such as schema inference, job scheduling, and dependency resolution—and supports loading curated data into services like Amazon Redshift for downstream analysis. Recent advancements in AWS Glue include generative AI-assisted development features that help automate and streamline complex transformation logic.</p>

For real-time, low-latency access, DynamoDB is used to store processed user activity data. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="semistructured data" id="id641"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="semistructured data" id="id642"/>DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless database that excels at handling unstructured or semistructured data with millisecond-level response times. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fraud detection" data-secondary="DynamoDB for" id="id643"/>It’s ideal for use cases like real-time personalization, fraud detection, and social engagement.</p>
<p>For structured transactional data—such as order histories, payment records, or customer profiles that require relational integrity—the<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon RDS" data-secondary="storage of structured transactional data" id="id644"/> system uses Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS supports popular database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server, and automates time-consuming administrative tasks such as backups, patching, and replication. It provides a familiar SQL interface, enforces data integrity through primary and foreign key constraints, and supports deployments across multiple AZs for high availability.</p>
<p>For analytical queries and large-scale reporting,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Redshift" id="id645"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="data warehouse" id="id646"/> Amazon Redshift acts as the system’s data warehouse. Amazon Redshift supports petabyte-scale storage and is optimized for high-performance SQL-based analytics. It integrates with visualization tools and can process both structured and semistructured data, making it useful for business intelligence, trend analysis, and historical reporting. Amazon Redshift is also known for delivering cost-effective performance, with up to three times better price-performance than traditional cloud data warehouses.</p>

For performance-intensive tasks such as training and running recommendation models, <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="scalability" data-secondary="Amazon EC2 scaling strategies" id="id653"/>Amazon EC2 offers two primary scaling strategies: vertical scaling, where resources are added to an individual instance, and horizontal scaling, where additional instances are spun up to distribute the workload. Horizontal scaling is particularly valuable in this context, as demand can fluctuate dramatically with user traffic.</p>
<p>Access to Amazon EC2 instances is both flexible and secure. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Secure Shell (SSH) for Amazon EC2 access" id="id654"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SSH (Secure Shell) for Amazon EC2 access" id="id655"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)" data-secondary="virtual machines of AWS" data-tertiary="accessing instances" id="id656"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="virtual machines (VMs)" data-secondary="Amazon EC2" data-tertiary="accessing instances" id="id657"/>One common method is using Secure Shell (SSH) with key pairs—a combination of a public key (stored on the instance) and a private key (kept by the user) that authenticates the connection without a password. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)" data-secondary="virtual machines of AWS" data-tertiary="EC2 Instance Connect via browser" id="id658"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS (Amazon Web Services)" data-secondary="Systems Manager" id="id659"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS Systems Manager" id="id660"/>Alternatively, developers and data scientists can use browser-based EC2 Instance Connect or AWS Systems Manager, which allows access without needing a public IP address or open inbound ports.</p>

EBS volumes provide low-latency block storage and retain data even if the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated—an essential feature for machine learning tasks that use large datasets or require model checkpoints. EBS offers two main types of storage: SSD-backed volumes (solid state drives), which deliver fast, consistent performance ideal for transactional workloads and high-speed processing; and HDD-backed volumes (hard disk drives), which are optimized for large, sequential data access and provide a more cost-effective option for throughput-intensive tasks. With 99.999% durability and replication across multiple AZs, EBS ensures reliable performance and data resilience.</p>

CloudFront accelerates the delivery of assets such as product images, promotional banners, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files by caching them at a global network of edge locations. When a user accesses content, CloudFront serves it from the nearest edge location. This significantly reduces latency and improves page load times, which are essential for high-traffic ecommerce applications where performance directly impacts user engagement and conversion rates.</p>
<p>One of the major advantages of CloudFront is its seamless integration with other AWS services, particularly Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2. For example, static content stored in Amazon S3 buckets can be automatically served through CloudFront, while dynamic content generated by EC2 instances can be routed efficiently using custom origin settings.</p>
<p>CloudFront also benefits from AWS’s extensive global infrastructure. The service leverages a vast number of edge locations, backed by high-capacity connections and partnerships with telecom operators, to ensure high availability and reliability at scale.</p>

CloudWatch provides real-time visibility into the health and behavior of over 70 AWS services, including Lambda, Amazon EC2, Amazon Redshift, and DynamoDB. It automatically collects standard resolution metrics, which are updated every minute for built-in AWS services, and supports high-resolution metrics with one-second granularity for custom monitoring.</p>
<p>Custom alarms are configured to detect unusual activity, such as CPU spikes, increased latency, or failed Lambda executions. When these thresholds are breached, <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)" id="id675"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SNS (Amazon Simple Notification Service)" id="id676"/>CloudWatch can trigger alerts via Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), sending real-time notifications to system administrators or triggering automated remediation workflows.</p>

<p>AWS is responsible for the security “of” the cloud, which includes protecting the infrastructure that operates all AWS services. This involves the physical security of data centers, hardware, software, networking, and the global infrastructure.</p>
<p>Conversely, customers are responsible for the security “in” the cloud, which involves securing the components they deploy and manage within the AWS environment. This responsibility varies based on the specific AWS services used, the integration of those services into their IT environment, and applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>For example, <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="IaaS (infrastructure as a service)" data-secondary="shared responsibility model" id="id681"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="infrastructure as a service (IaaS)" data-secondary="shared responsibility model" id="id682"/>when using IaaS offerings like Amazon EC2, customers have significant control and, consequently, greater responsibility. They must manage the guest operating system, including updates and security patches, configure firewall settings via security groups, and secure applications and data hosted on the instances.</p>
<p>In contrast, with SaaS offerings,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SaaS (software as a service)" data-secondary="shared responsibility model" id="id683"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="software as a service (SaaS)" data-secondary="shared responsibility model" id="id684"/> AWS manages the underlying infrastructure, reducing the customer’s security responsibilities. However, customers are still responsible for managing access controls and permissions using IAM, implementing data encryption policies, and classifying and managing their data.</p>
<p>To assist customers in fulfilling their security responsibilities,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="AWS tools" id="id685"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS (Amazon Web Services)" data-secondary="security tools" id="id686"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS Key Management Service (KMS)" data-secondary="about" id="id687"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="security and privacy" data-tertiary="encryption via AWS Key Management Service" id="id688"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="encryption of data" data-secondary="AWS Key Management Service" id="id689"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS CloudTrail" data-secondary="about" id="id690"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="monitoring" data-secondary="AWS CloudTrail" id="id691"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="logging" data-secondary="AWS CloudTrail" id="id692"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)" data-secondary="about" id="id693"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS Config" data-secondary="about" id="id694"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS Trusted Advisor" data-secondary="about" id="id695"/> AWS provides a suite of security tools. These include IAM for managing user access and permissions, AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for creating and controlling encryption keys, AWS CloudTrail for monitoring and logging account activity, AWS Config for assessing and evaluating configurations of AWS resources, and AWS Trusted Advisor for providing real-time guidance to help provision resources following AWS best practices.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="02shar" id="id696"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="02shar2" id="id697"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="02shar3" id="id698"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="02shar4" id="id699"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="02shar5" id="id700"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="c02shar6" id="id701"/></p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="AWS IAM"><div class="sect1" id="aws_iam">
<h1>AWS IAM</h1>
<p>AWS IAM manages the<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)" id="id702"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="Amazon IAM" id="id703"/> authentication and authorization of your AWS resources. There is much customization for the permissions. They can be broad or strictly based on the principle of least privilege—granting users and systems only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the risk of accidental or malicious misuse of resources.</p>
<p>Here are the different types of IAM users and entities:</p>
<dl>
<dt>IAM user</dt>
<dd><p>This is a person, app, or system.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)" data-secondary="IAM user" id="id704"/> Each has a name and credentials. If an IAM user has administrator privileges, this is also not a root user. Rather, this user has full administrative control over AWS services.</p></dd>
<dt>IAM group</dt>
<dd><p>This is a group of IAM users.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)" data-secondary="IAM group" id="id705"/> An IAM group allows you to set permissions for multiple users. For example, a developer group may have permissions to use Amazon S3 storage. So when there is a new member added, they will have this permission. Or if a person is removed from the group, the permissions will be terminated.</p></dd>
<dt>IAM role</dt>
<dd><p>This is not a user.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)" data-secondary="IAM role" id="id706"/> It’s an identity that has specific permissions. For example, a role can be assigned to one or more IAM users. Typically, a role is for granting temporary access to AWS resources.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>Another layer of security<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="multi-factor authentication (MFA)" id="id707"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="MFA (multi-factor authentication)" id="id708"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="multi-factor authentication" id="id709"/> of IAM is multi-factor authentication (MFA). This requires two or more proofs of identity to log in. An example would be a password and a code from your smartphone or an authentication app.</p>
<p>A key part of IAM is establishing policies.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)" data-secondary="policies" id="id710"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="policies" data-secondary="AWS IAM" id="id711"/> These are in JSON format and define who can do what. There are two main types of policies:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Identity-based policies</dt>
<dd><p>You will assign these to users, groups, or roles. For example, you might give a developer permission to launch Amazon EC2 instances and access CloudWatch Logs.</p></dd>
<dt>Resource-based policies</dt>
<dd><p>You will assign these to specific resources, like an Amazon S3 bucket. For instance, you can add a policy to an Amazon S3 bucket that allows a specific IAM user or another AWS account to read or write objects in that bucket.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>AWS provides tools to customize and test your IAM setup. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)" data-secondary="IAM Access Analyzer" id="id712"/>For example, IAM Access Analyzer helps you identify if any of your resources are shared with outsiders. In some cases, you may not even realize this is happening.</p>

The Free Tier comprises three types of offers:</p>
<dl>
<dt>12 months free tier</dt>
<dd><p>Available to new AWS customers for 12 months following account creation, this offer includes services such as 750 hours per month of Amazon EC2 t2.micro or t3.micro instances (Linux or Windows), 5 GB of Amazon S3 standard storage, and 750 hours of Amazon RDS Single-AZ db.t2.micro instances.</p></dd>
<dt>Always free</dt>
