- en: Part 3 takes a code-first deep dive into the core concepts of causal inference.
    Readers will explore structural causal models, interventions, multi-world counterfactual
    reasoning, and causal identification—where we determine what kinds of causal questions
    you can answer with your model and your data. This part will prepare you to take
    on the more challenging but rewarding aspects of causal inference, providing practical
    code-based tools for reasoning about “what if” scenarios. By the end, you’ll be
    ready to use causal inference techniques in real-world decision-making scenarios,
    leveraging both generative modeling frameworks and deep learning tools.
