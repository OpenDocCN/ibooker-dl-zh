    the realm of infrastructure and resource management. LLMs, as you’ve seen throughout
    this book, are computationally intensive, requiring substantial hardware, storage,
    and network resources to operate efficiently. Whether you’re leveraging LLMs as
    a cloud-based service, deploying pretrained models in on-premises data centers,
    or training your own models from scratch, your infrastructure decisions will influence
    their performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

    of the application that you want to use it for. For startups or small-scale applications,
    using models directly from the cloud may be the quickest and most cost-effective
    solution. For enterprises with specialized requirements or high workloads, deploying
    LLMs on cloud infrastructure can help you find an appropriate balance between
    flexibility and scalability. Finally, for organizations with strict data privacy
    or latency requirements, local deployment offers unmatched control and security,
    though at the cost of higher operational complexity.

    a third-party API-based approach; that is, start by using models directly from
    the cloud. One of the major issues I’ve observed in real-world deployments is
    figuring out whether the LLM is a good solution to a given problem. Using a third-party,
    API-based approach will allow you to answer that question in a prototype before
    committing a large number of resources to infrastructure.

    this the “iceberg problem” where the visible tip is the failure, but the real
    hidden issue is memory inefficiency beneath. Most people don’t realize that the
    real miss-out is when the suboptimal memory use goes unnoticed and under-utilized.
    Thus, people leave a lot of performance on the table. If you’re hitting memory
    walls, don’t reach for more hardware just yet. When used correctly, methods like
    sharding, activation checkpointing, dynamic batching, model offloading, etc.,
    can easily make your 24 GB consumer GPU behave like a 48 GB A100.

    resources. Then, once you have this information, you need to be able to react
    quickly. While it’s possible to live with manual deployments, the costs will likely
    become prohibitive over time. This is especially true if the demand for your service
    varies a lot, which could happen if your service achieves sudden success or expands
    to different geographical regions whose usage patterns reflect different time

    by adding instances, while *vertical scaling* increases the capacity of existing
    nodes. *Caching* frequently accessed responses reduces latency and lessens the
    workload on the model, while *batching* low-priority queries enhances efficiency.
    Furthermore, techniques like model distillation and quantization (discussed in
    [Chapter 5](ch05.html#ch05_model_domain_adaptation_for_llm_based_applications_1748896666813361))

    A/B testing is a widely used method for evaluating the performance of different
    versions of a system. In the LLM context, A/B testing involves deploying two versions
    of the LLM—often referred to as the “champion” (the existing model) and the “challenger”
    (the new model)—to determine which performs better under real-world conditions
    using the metrics described previously.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, *shadow testing* provides a safer, less intrusive way to evaluate
    a new model without directly affecting users. In this approach, the challenger
    model runs in the background, “shadowing” the champion model by processing the
    same inputs (or a fraction of them, for cost savings) but without influencing
    the live application’s outputs. This allows teams to collect performance data,
    identify potential issues, and fine-tune the challenger model before making it
    available to users. Shadow testing is particularly useful for testing LLMs in
    high-stakes or sensitive applications, such as customer service or healthcare,
    where introducing a flawed model could lead to significant negative consequences.
    Again, the better defined your metrics are, the more accurately you can see whether
    the new model performs better or worse than the existing one.

    Azure Resource Manager (ARM), and Google Cloud Deployment Manager allow you to
    deploy *infrastructure as code* (IaC) and define infrastructure requirements like
    products, versions, and features in declarative YAML or JSON templates. These
    templates automate resource provisioning to keep environments consistent across
    multiple deployments.

    to scale resources automatically based on demand. Services like AWS Auto Scaling,
    Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Autoscaler
    can dynamically increase or decrease the number of compute instances based on
    predefined metrics, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and GPU utilization.
    Linking one of these tools to your monitoring setup can really help you manage
    costs and latency. This elasticity is particularly useful for LLM inference, which
    consumes expensive resources quickly. You can also use your monitoring metrics
    to automatically scale down resources that are not being used and quickly scale
    up when needed.

    Spot VMs, and GCP preemptible VMs, which let you take advantage of unused capacity
    at a lower price. These are ideal for noncritical workloads, such as batch processing
    or distributed LLM training. However, because these instances can be interrupted,
    it’s critical to integrate their provisioning with your monitoring infrastructure
    to manage fault tolerance and job retries.

    Azure Monitor, and GCP Operations Suite can track resource utilization, detect
    anomalies, and trigger automated actions. You can combine them with automation
    tools like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or GCP Cloud Functions to enable *self-healing*
    architectures. For example, if a GPU instance fails during an LLM training job,
    a function can automatically provision a replacement instance, then restart the
    job. These tools are very configurable. While you’re likely to use many preconfigured
    metrics as they are (such as those for CPU and memory usage), you should still
    configure custom metrics for your specific use case.

    servers and virtualized environments. Bare metal offers better performance and
    is well suited for resource-intensive tasks like LLM training or fine-tuning,
    especially when paired with high-end GPUs like NVIDIA A100s or H100s. However,
    virtualization provides greater flexibility, allowing multiple workloads to share
    resources. Tools like Kubernetes node pools can allocate GPU resources to pods
    dynamically, optimizing resource utilization across LLM workloads.

    it requires purchasing and provisioning additional hardware. Hybrid approaches—combining
    owned hardware with cloud resources—can address this limitation. For example,
    you might train your LLM using local GPUs but offload inference or testing workloads
    to the cloud during peak demand. However, hybrid architectures also present challenges;
    for example, your LLMOps engineer will need to configure the endpoints and parameters
    for when to send requests to different endpoints, as well as implement monitoring
    and automatic failure recovery. [Table 9-1](#ch09_table_1_1748896826210123) compares

    these factors to optimize use of available computational power.

    in [Chapter 5](ch05.html#ch05_model_domain_adaptation_for_llm_based_applications_1748896666813361),
    which revealed that many earlier LLMs, such as GPT-3, were undertrained relative
    to their size. These models used a disproportionate amount of compute to scale
    their number of parameters but didn’t implement a corresponding increase in the
    volume of training data. This imbalance resulted in suboptimal performance because
    the models had a vast number of parameters but weren’t exposed to enough training
    data to find the optimal weights for those parameters.
  id: totrans-77

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The practical implication here is that, when allocating computational resources
    to train an LLM, you have to balance the model’s size with the amount of training
    data. That’s where the compute-optimal argument comes in. For instance, rather
    than building a massive model but training it with inadequate data, it may be
    a more effective use of resources to create a smaller model and train it more
    thoroughly on the same dataset.
  id: totrans-78

- en: A major benefit of training models with a compute-optimal balance is that they
    tend to require less retraining or fine-tuning for downstream tasks than overly
    large, undertrained models require. More modern default models like GPT-4 and
    newer versions of Claude and Gemini do apply the compute-optimal principle, making
    them better at general tasks and decreasing the need for custom fine-tuning.
