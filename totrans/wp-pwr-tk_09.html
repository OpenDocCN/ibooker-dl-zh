<p class="body">You can monetize—make money with—your website in a variety of ways. It’s your job to ensure that the approach you choose aligns well with your audience, the site’s content, and your personal goals and resources.</p>
<p class="body">In this chapter, we’ll look at the most popular and effective ways to monetize a site. You <i class="fm-italics">can</i> make money with most types of sites, one way or another. However, it’s important to understand that even when making money, your primary goal for most sites should remain ensuring that your site satisfies your audience’s expectations with excellent, polished content. And any advertising, sales, or requests for donations should be at least secondary, if not tertiary.</p>
<p class="body">For many kinds of e-commerce, you’ll want to use a plugin. In this chapter, we’ll explore the most popular one, WooCommerce (<a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/9Yw8">https://mng.bz/9Yw8</a>).</p>
<p class="body">The topic of e-commerce is vast and varies greatly based on the kind of site you run and the type of sales you intend to pursue. E-commerce could easily fill a book on its own, with each chapter devoted to a different subtopic. Here, we’ll present an overview, with suggestions and guidelines to point you to resources for further detail about your specific use case.</p>
<p class="body">And, of course, these days, the primary essential resource is AI. So, describe in detail your site’s purpose, its audience, and the e-commerce variant you want to employ. Then, submit that to GPT or one of the other AIs. Ask for suggestions about tactics, where you’ll find the strongest competition, how to locate clear documentation, and any other topics you need to address.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_3">10.1 Nine ways to monetize a WordPress site</h2>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-254"/>Here are nine of the most popular ways to monetize a site. Note that some sites use more than one of them:<a id="idIndexMarker002"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Affiliate marketing</i>—Write reviews or otherwise promote products or services resulting in a commission if your visitor clicks a link that takes them to something to purchase. This kind of marketing comes in two version<a id="idTextAnchor003"/>s: pay-per-sale (PPS) and pay-per-click (PPC). With PPS, you earn money only if there is a sale. This is the most common version and can also be the more rewarding. With PPC, you get paid when someone just clicks on the affiliate link, regardless of whether there is a sale. A variant of PPC <a id="idTextAnchor004"/>is pay-per-lead (PPL), where you’re paid if someone just signs up for a newsletter, fills out a form, joins a website, or other similar results. <a id="idIndexMarker003"/><a id="idIndexMarker004"/><a id="idIndexMarker005"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Advertising</i>—Ads are placed on your site. Google’s AdSense, for example, places ads relevant to your audience. You can choose to place the ads where you wish, or let Google, employing its AI optimization algorithms, choose the places it judges the most effective. It can also decide which kinds of ads would work best and how large they are.<a id="idIndexMarker006"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Sponsored content</i>—You promote someone else’s products or services. This works best if you have a large site or serve a particular, narrowly focused area of interest (and thus have a well-targeted customer base).<a id="idIndexMarker007"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Offering your own products or services</i>—Selling digital content, professional services, or physical goods.<a id="idIndexMarker008"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Drop-shipping</i>—You sell goods, but you don’t need to warehouse your inventory. Your site has a catalog or other e-commerce section, but you avoid the necessity of managing the physical goods. Someone else holds and delivers the goods for you. These suppliers could be wholesalers, manufacturers, or just other retailers. Another advantage is that you don’t risk purchasing inventory that doesn’t move. That allows you to test various products without risk.<a id="idIndexMarker009"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Subscriptions</i>—You can offer special or premium content, or provide additional features on the site, by charging a subscription fee. If you have unique, specialized, or very high-quality offerings, this approach can result in an excellent income stream. <a id="idIndexMarker010"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Donations</i>—If your content or services are popular, you can ask for donations. You can ask your audience for direct donations to support your work. GiveWP and Contact Form 7 are popular plugins for requesting donations. <a id="idIndexMarker011"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Crowdfunding</i>—Similar to donations, you give your customers an option to support your cause, project, or product d<a id="idTextAnchor005"/>evelopment. WP Crowdfunding is a good plugin to use for this purpose.<a id="idIndexMarker012"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Webinars or online courses</i>—Translate your expertise into cash online. Go live in a video conference via a web seminar. You provide online training and share your knowledge with your students. Or create lessons you can offer online, and employ a written discussion area or forum where you can answer questions and students can interact.<a id="idIndexMarker013"/><a id="idIndexMarker014"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Licensing content or selling digital assets</i>—If you create original content such as photographs, videos, or digital art, you can license them to others or sell digital assets directly from your website. There is a distinction between licensing and outright selling. With the former, you grant permission for reuse but don’t transfer ownership of the content. And you can set up a recurring fee if you wish. The latter is usually a one-time payment process. And the buyer is likely to get fewer restrictions on usage than with licensing. <a id="marker-255"/><a id="idIndexMarker015"/><a id="idIndexMarker016"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_4">10.2 The wrong way to monetize</h2>
<p class="body">One great danger with advertising in a website—perhaps the greatest danger—is irritating your audience. The worst offenders are pop-up ads. These intrusive ads cover site content until they are either ready to go away automatically or are closed by the user. Some pop-ups aren’t that easy to close because they don’t display an x for a while, or they hide it in unusual locations (the upper-right corner is where people expect to find the x in Windows). This kind of forced interaction can be exasperating. Some pop-ups even open a new browser tab. Most browsers, however, do feature pop-up blockers. <a id="idIndexMarker017"/></p>
<p class="body">Another distraction is the use of ads that are animated, flashing, displaying annoyingly bright colors, or otherwise disruptive visuals. And some people are sensitive to this kind of stimulation. So this makes your site less accessible to people facing such challenges.</p>
<p class="body">Many people also resent audio or video that starts playing automatically. Let your customers decide when or if they want to hear or see your ad.</p>
<p class="body">People rarely come to a site to read its ads. So if you crowd your content with too many ads, or you cluster them together, they’re in direct competition with your site’s content. And it’s that content that people are most likely interested in.</p>
<p class="body">Ads not relevant to your site’s topic are also bothersome. They are seen by most of us as an interruption. They likely have nothing to do with your customers’ interests.</p>
<p class="body">Some videos or large, high-resolution image ads can slow down page load time too. You’ll want to test for this because many people around the world have slow internet connections. How to test your page load speeds is explained in the chapter 8, section 8.1.</p>
<p class="body">Continuing to fill out our list of ways to offend via advertising is <i class="fm-italics">clickbait</i>. This is when you display a headline or image that turns out to be a trick. The user clicks it to see more, but the more isn’t what the clickbait promised.<a id="idIndexMarker018"/></p>
<p class="body">We’ll conclude this list of offenders with <i class="fm-italics">interstitial</i> ads—a full-page ad that completely blocks the site’s contents. Some such ads are displayed on the home page, and some appear between pages as the visitor moves to view an interior page. Some allow the visitor to close them, while others evaporate only after an interval of their own choosing . . . at last giving the visitor access to the site proper. These kinds of ads certainly command attention because they are as large as can be. If you do choose to use interstitial ads, and you rarely should, take care how you employ them. And give your patient visitors an obvious way to close these ads and get on with their life.<a id="idIndexMarker019"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_5">10.2.1 Advertising the right way</h3>
<p class="body">The <i class="fm-italics">right</i> way to use ads is to ensure they are harmonic with the surrounding content, and thus don’t call attention away from that content. To find ways to improve how a site handles its ads, I submitted to GPT a screenshot of the home page of FindGift.com, a pretty busy site with ads aplenty.<a id="marker-256"/><a id="idIndexMarker020"/></p>
<p class="body">You can submit images to GPT and other AI systems given that they are in the process of becoming <i class="fm-italics">multimodal.</i> In the past, they would only accept text, but increasingly they’re open to all kinds of input—audio, video, images, data sets. GPT did an admirable job of looking at the image, judging it, and then suggesting ways to soften the effect of the many busy ads in FindGift.com. Here’s the prompt I gave:<a id="idIndexMarker021"/></p>

<p class="fm-exercise">The website in the image seems to be a gift-finding service with various categories and gift ideas. Here are some suggestions for improving the home page to ensure that the advertisements and layout are unobtrusive and user-friendly:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Consolidate Navigation: The top navigation bar is quite busy with multiple tabs, buttons, and services. Simplifying this area could help visitors find what they need faster and with less distraction.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Simplify Design Elements: The site uses a variety of colors, fonts, and button styles. A more unified design scheme could be less visually overwhelming and more pleasing.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Streamline Content: There are multiple sections on the page advertising different categories and occasions. Condensing these into a more streamlined, easy-to-navigate format could improve user experience.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Limit Animated Elements: If any of the images or banners are animated, they should be used sparingly as they can be distracting and slow down site loading times.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Improve Advertisement Integration: Ads from partners are prominently featured and could be integrated more seamlessly into the site’s layout so as not to appear too distinct from the site’s own content.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Optimize for Mobile: Ensure that the site is responsive and that any advertisements do not overwhelm the content on smaller screens.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Reduce Pop-Ups and Overlays: If there are any pop-up ads or overlays that are not visible in the screenshot, these should be used minimally as they can be particularly intrusive.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Balanced Placement of Partner Logos: The logos of partner sites could be made smaller and placed in a less central location so as not to compete with the site’s own content.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Focus on User Experience: Overall, the goal should be to create a balance where advertisements are present but do not take away from the core purpose of the site, which is to help users find gifts easily.</p>

<p class="fm-exercise">Including ads on your blog about bass fishing at Randleman Lake in a way that is unobtrusive and subtle is a great approach. Here are some tips to do this effectively:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Relevant Ad Content: Make sure the ads are relevant to your audience. Ads related to fishing gear, outdoor apparel, local fishing tours, or conservation efforts would be more interesting to your readers and less likely to be seen as intrusive.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Ad Placement: Place ads in areas where they don’t disrupt the reading flow. Common places include the sidebar, header, or footer of your blog. Avoid placing ads in the middle of your articles as this can be disruptive.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Limit Pop-Ups and Auto-Play Media: Avoid pop-up ads or auto-play videos with sound as they can be particularly annoying and might deter visitors from returning to your site.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Use Ad Networks Wisely: Choose an ad network that allows you to control the types of ads displayed. Networks like Google AdSense are popular and offer some level of control over ad content.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Monitor Ad Frequency: Don’t overload your page with ads. Too many ads can make your site look cluttered and distract from your content.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Transparency: Be transparent with your audience about using ads. A brief mention that ads support your blog can make your readers more receptive to them.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Test and Get Feedback: After implementing ads, ask for feedback from your regular visitors. This can provide valuable insights into how your audience perceives the ads and whether they find them intrusive.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">By following these guidelines, you can integrate ads into your blog in a way that respects your visitors’ experience while also providing a source of revenue for your blog.</p>

<p class="body">Next, let’s take a look at the best e-commerce plugin.<a id="idIndexMarker022"/><a id="idIndexMarker023"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_6">10.3 Choosing the right e-commerce plugin</h2>
<p class="body">We website owners usually appreciate additional revenue streams, and e-commerce provides them. If you plan to sell things, you’ll want to choose the best e-commerce plugin for your site. The plugin must be easy to use, efficient, secure, and offer the features necessary for your business.<a id="idIndexMarker024"/><a id="marker-258"/><a id="idIndexMarker025"/></p>
<p class="body">T<a id="idTextAnchor006"/>hat said, WooCommerce (by Automattic, WordPress’s parent company) is by far the dominant e-commerce plugin. It’s open source and freemium—so you can start off free, but if you need additional features, you can just upgrade, paying various amounts for the various additional options. You can also add features via the many WooCommerce extensions (more about them shortly).</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_7">10.3.1 Why WooCommerce dominates this space</h3>
<p class="body">WooCommerce is known to provide an easy-to-use shopping system that makes the purchasing process for clients smooth and effortless. But it’s a truth universally acknowledged that nothing is perfect. So, let’s consider both WooCommerce’s good and not-so-good qualities. We’ll start with the pluses:<a id="idIndexMarker026"/><a id="idIndexMarker027"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Extreme flexibility</i>—WooCommerce provides many ways to sell quite a variety of goods and services. It covers all the bases, facilitating every type of e-commerce. It helps you sell actual objects, such as couches or hair products; downloadable books, such as comic books or novels; and external goods, such as affiliate marketing on Amazon, invitations to training courses or webinars, and more. And, if you don’t find what you need in the main WooCommerce system, there are many add-ons available. Go to your Plugins &gt; Add Plugins screen, search for <code class="fm-code-in-text">WooCommerce</code>, and you’ll see dozens of popular WooCommerce-related plugins to add specialized functionality.<a id="idIndexMarker028"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Impressive scalability</i>—Companies from small to huge can operate efficiently within the WooCommerce system. If your sales rocket upward, you need not be concerned that the plugin won’t be able to handle the growth.<a id="idIndexMarker029"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Countless ways to customize</i>—You can build a store tailored to the kind of goods you sell and the customers you sell to. <a id="idIndexMarker030"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Excellent protection</i>—Because this is an online platform, your customers expect secure gateways to prevent credential or other data theft. WooCommerce includes safe payment gateways such as Stripe and PayPal. Because the WooCommerce platform is so widely used, hackers regularly target it. To protect your client’s privacy, you can use a backup system that keeps data encrypted. And to further deter hackers, WooCommerce also lets you add a security plugin that periodically checks your website for viruses. You probably already have the Wordfence plugin actively protecting your entire site, and security systems are also active and effective in most hosting services. But redundancy in security is a good thing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_8">10.3.2 Where to get help</h3>
<p class="body">WooCommerce has a large and active community. Roughly 4.5 million WooCommerce websites are currently live. Members of this sizable user community post articles and instructions on setups that have worked for them. You’ll find forums and other online gathering places where you can ask questions and get feedback from WooCommerce experts. Here are some of the top discussion boards for anything related to WooCommerce:<a id="marker-259"/><a id="idIndexMarker031"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Advanced WooCommerce</i>—You’ll find a variety of WooCommerce professionals in this restricted Facebook group. Among its more than 25,000 members are WordPress developers. Its main focus is on WooCommerce’s more sophisticated features. If you have more inquiries than GPT or Google can handle, this is the place to go.<a id="idIndexMarker032"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">WooCommerce Help &amp; Share</i>—Also a private Facebook group, it boasts 41,000 members. This is the advanced group’s little brother. This group is used by all people of all levels of expertise—beginners included. It’s the place where users go to ask common WooCommerce questions and receive guidance from other, more experienced users.<a id="idIndexMarker033"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">WooCommerce Help Page</i>—Go to the WooCommerce &gt; Home screen, and in the upper-right corner, click Help. Choose Get Support or one of the other options. This is the main forum, and you get access to it by registering with WordPress. WooCommerce developers and other knowledgeable community members lead these discussions. Although it’s an excellent place to start if you have questions, you might find a bit of a wait for responses. The Facebook groups are the number one choice because of their more rapid replies. <a id="idIndexMarker034"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">The Shopping Cart</i>—Your customers can complete transactions more easily because WooCom<a id="idTextAnchor007"/>merce provides access to excellent point of sale (POS; a website’s checkout system—the shopping cart process) and warehouse management systems. From the outset, your e-commerce system will convey security, reliability, and professionalism. Customers can also easily track all of their orders and check the progress of their deliveries. <a id="idIndexMarker035"/><a id="idIndexMarker036"/><a id="idIndexMarker037"/><a id="idIndexMarker038"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_9">10.4 Any drawbacks?</h2>
<p class="body">Although WooCommerce is quite impressive and a very mature and effective system, it’s not perfect. You should consider a couple of drawbacks that might influence your decision about whether or not to use it:<a id="idIndexMarker039"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">If your website is custom made and isn’t mounted on WordPress, you can’t use WooCommerce. It’s designed to fit into WordPress only. So older, established sites might well be using other systems.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">If you go beyond the basics, there can be costs. Although WooCommerce can be downloaded and installed for free, you may find you want to upgrade to a paid plan or need to purchase some WooCommerce extensions (similar to plugins) to make your e-commerce efforts successful.</p>
<p class="list">For instance, you will be responsible for paying for a secure payment gateway if you decide to use something other than PayPal. The majority of WooCommerce extensions require subscriptions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_10">10.4.1 An alternative to WooCommerce</h3>
<p class="body">WooCommerce <i class="fm-italics">is</i> considered the best WordPress e-commerce plugin. Because its advantages far outweigh its disadvantages, choosing WooCommerce will probably make things easier overall for both you and your customers.<a id="marker-260"/><a id="idIndexMarker040"/></p>
<p class="body">But if your needs are limited to offering downloadable digital content, and you don’t need all of WooCommerce’s additional functionality, you might take a look at Easy Digital Downloads. This plugin handles sales of digital goods, such as music, e-books, themes, images, PDFs, and so on. True, WooCommerce is also quite capable of handling these kinds of transactions, but it’s a much larger sy<a id="idTextAnchor008"/>stem—and might be more than you require.</p>
<p class="body">Easy Digital Downloads has a very basic interface, which makes it easy to set up. Using the plugin to track and analyze sales is also simple. Go to your Plugins &gt; Add New screen, search for <code class="fm-code-in-text">Easy Digital Downloads</code>, and then click the Details button to read all about it.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_11">10.5 Be sure to use Secure Sockets Layer</h2>
<p class="body">If you want to drive away prospective customers real fast, the surest way is to force their browser to display a Not Secure warning when they land on your home page. Who’s going to provide their credit card info, or indeed any other personal information, to a site that’s not encrypting communications with its customers? “Not secure” translates in many peoples’ minds as “This way to the dark web.”<a id="idIndexMarker041"/><a id="idIndexMarker042"/></p>
<p class="body">The purpose of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is to mangle (encrypt) any message from your site to a customer or from the customer to the site. This way, nobody intercepting the transmissions can decrypt that garbled data.</p>
<p class="body">When you add SSL to your site, your URL changes from <i class="fm-italics">http</i> to <i class="fm-italics">https</i> and lets browsers know SSL is active and thus your site is secure<a id="idTextAnchor009"/>. More recently, an improved system called Transport Layer Security (TLS) has actually replaced SSL. Even though the term <i class="fm-italics">SSL</i> is still widely used, in practice, SSL really refers to a TLS system.<a id="idIndexMarker043"/></p>
<p class="body">SSL was introduced in the mid-1990s by the then-popular browser Netscape. Over time, TLS was introduced and is revised now and then to provide even stronger security. For example, TLS 1.3, the latest version, replaces older, less effective, less secure cryptographic algorithms. It also employs a streamlined handshake process that provides both faster connections and enhanced security.</p>
<p class="body">Some hosting services, such as SiteGround, Bluehost, and DreamHost (excepting DreamHost’s most basic $2.95/month plan), offer free SSL, and the process of installing and verifying it is automatic. But if you’re one of those brave souls who hosts your site yourself on your own hard drive, SSL installation is going to be a rather complex, multistep process.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Note</span> For information about adding SSL to a SiteGround-hosted site, check out <a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/jp59">https://mng.bz/jp59</a>.</p>
<p class="body">Here are the reasons that SSL is a must for any site, but especially for e-commerce sites:</p>

<p class="body">The design and wording of the CTA are critical in making it effective. The CTA should be visually striking, so they notice that something needs to be done. It should also clearly state what will happen when the customer clicks the CTA or otherwise activates it. And you should let them see a benefit, or create a sense of urgency.</p>
<p class="body">CTAs can be essential for directing site customers through the purchasing process and winning them over as clients or customers. A CTA is usually an attention-grabbing element, such as a button with a dramatic color or shape. Also, use language that calls for action, like “Buy Now,” “Learn More,” or “Sign Up.” Because CTAs directly affect user engagement and <i class="fm-italics">conversion rates</i>, the performance of an e-commerce website can be significantly influenced by the effectiveness of your CTA.<a id="idIndexMarker055"/></p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">
<p class="fm-sidebar-title">What is a conversion rate?</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">In e-commerce and digital marketing, a <i class="fm-italics">conversion rate</i> is the proportion of website visitors who do what you hope they’ll do. This depends of course on the goals you have in mind. It could be purchasing something, subscribing to a newsletter, downloading a resource, booking an event, or any other key performance indicator (KPI).<a id="idIndexMarker056"/><a id="idIndexMarker057"/></p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text"><i class="fm-italics">KPI</i> is a quantifiable indicator of how well a corporation is accomplishing important goals. In the context of website conversion rate, KPI is a metric to help you see how well your site converts users into customers or leads. <a id="idIndexMarker058"/></p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">To find the conversion rate as a percentage, divide the total number of visitors by the number of conversions. Then, multiply the result by 100. A website with 2,000 visitors per month and 100 purchases, for instance, would have a conversion rate of <span class="times">(100 ÷ 2000) × 100 = 5%</span>.</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Understanding conversion rates lets you gauge how successful a website is in terms of marketing. A low conversion rate means that you should perhaps improve the website’s content, user experience (UX), design, or CTA.<a id="idIndexMarker059"/><a id="idIndexMarker060"/></p>

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_13">10.6.1 AI-generated surveys</h3>

<p class="body">I submitted the upcoming prompt to GPT-4o, Perplexity, and Gemini. Perplexity provided a rather short survey, mainly just rewriting the prompt. Gemini, however, even added appropriate optional details such as “Select all that apply,” “Other (please specify),” and a bonus section. It also added some good ideas about how to perhaps improve the survey and increase the return rate by offering an incentive. GPT also provided a solid survey in HTML. GPT correctly pointed out: “Note that email functionality requires server-side support to securely send emails (JavaScript alone can’t securely email on its own, so you’ll need a server-side solution or plugin to manage that step).” Overall, GPT and Gemini give us the kind of useful first draft you would expect from an effective assistant site administrator:</p>

<p class="fm-exercise">Include checkboxes, blank lines, input boxes, and other input elements so the survey can be completed online by my site’s visitors.

<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   The blog page where I interact with the audience</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">So in this survey, please find out if they want additional kinds of recipes, or information on other Instant Pot topics. And find out what they like best and worst about the current site. What can be improved. Also how often they visit. Things like that. Their reaction to the site’s content. And its navigation system.

<p class="body">Gemini did fine creating an HTML survey. I tested it by pasting it into the Text tab of an Edit Page screen in WordPress. It also included code to send the results via email. I never got the email though.</p>
<p class="body">But I think it won’t be too long before AI systems will generate fully functional input-output pages such as surveys, quizzes, and other site-visitor interactions. Input is fairly easy, and GPT and Gemini do it well, creating working HTML code you can just paste into the Text tab of one of your pages. But collecting and emailing the survey data requires a bit more access to server-side programming than AI currently has.</p>

<p class="body">Marketing is to e-commerce what fertilizer is to plants. Establishing an online business requires more than just building a website and waiting to see if something happens, if someone drops by. They don’t come if they don’t know it’s even there. <a id="idIndexMarker068"/></p>
<p class="body">To increase sales, draw in clients, and build traffic, a comprehensive marketing plan is important. Here are a few effective strategies to try:</p>

<div class="fm-sidebar-block">
<p class="fm-sidebar-title">Try OptinMonster</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">OptinMonster is a multifaceted WordPress plugin for email list development and lead generation.

<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Their Exit-Intent technology, an important component of OptinMonster, senses when a user is ready to leave your website and displays a tailored pop-up at that exact moment! This system can help turn your visitors into consumers and email subscribers. Also, you can display personalized pop-ups based on someone’s activity, geography, and other factors with OptinMonster’s behavior-based customizations.</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">The plugin also gives you A/B testing features, so you can see the effects resulting from multiple variations of your pop-ups.
