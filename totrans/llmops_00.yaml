- en: I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve been asked, “What’s the difference between
    an LLM/AI engineer and an LLMOps engineer?” It’s one of those questions that keep
    popping up, whether I’m in a meeting, at a conference, or just grabbing coffee
    with someone in the field.

    But over time, I realized the real issue: people don’t fully grasp what it takes
    to keep the lights on with large language models (LLMs) in production over an
    extended period.'

- en: As I write this in early 2025, the top models, techniques, and best practices
    are changing every few days. Thus, very few people understand their complexity.
    Most people still think of *operationalizing*, or “Ops,” as deployment, but in
    the LLM context, Ops is really about streamlining people, processes, and technology
    to make these models secure, robust, and reliable in production.

    what it all means for their teams and their projects, and in this book I have
    done my best to answer that question. This book isn’t a tutorial on defining roles
    or how to build and deploy an LLM; while it touches on both of those topics, that
    isn’t enough anymore. Once LLM-based applications are in production, someone has
    to keep them optimized, or they risk becoming overengineered solutions to simple
    problems or, worse, badly maintained houses of cards that crumble under high demand
    or a prompt injection attack.

- en: In traditional software development (or Software 2.0), you wouldn’t ask your
    lead developer to build *and* maintain your entire product. Software development
    engineers build, and reliability engineers maintain. Building and maintaining
    LLMs requires a similar separation of duties. In Software 3.0, LLM/AI engineers
    build and LLMOps engineers maintain!

- en: Although machine learning operations (MLOps) are foundational to LLMOps, the
    MLOps skills that engineers gain from working on structured data and discriminative
    models don’t fully translate to generative models.

- en: In short, I’m writing this book to help you appreciate the unique aspects of
    the full LLM-based application lifecycle, from data engineering to model deployment
    and API design to monitoring, security, and resource optimization. I want to give
    you a strong foundation for making decisions as you build, maintain, and optimize
    your LLM data, models, and applications.
