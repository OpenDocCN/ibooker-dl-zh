# Part II. Utilizing LLMs

In this part of the book, we will explore how to harness and adapt pre-trained LLMs to solve various kinds of language tasks that we introduced in [Chapter 1](ch01.html#chapter_llm-introduction). To make the best use of these chapters, I strongly suggest that you experiment hands-on with all the techniques introduced, as well as run the corresponding tutorials from the accompanying GitHub repo for this book.
