<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_3">12.1 The purchase funnel</h2>
<p class="body">Marketers use the phrase <i class="fm-italics">purchase funnel.</i> It’s like a tunnel, but it keeps getting narrower and narrower until there’s only one way out. (The more polite term is <i class="fm-italics">purchasing journey.</i>) This funnel has three stages:<a id="idIndexMarker002"/><a id="idIndexMarker003"/><a id="marker-294"/></p>
<ol class="calibre7">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Acquisition</i>—Build awareness of your product, make them interested, and believe that you might offer a solution for them. Sometimes, this can mean solving a problem they didn’t even know they had:</p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">“We already have a vacuum cleaner.”</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">“Sure, but let me show you our Swirling Dervish. You’ll be surprised how much nasty dirt your vacuum left behind here in your carpet!” (Turns on Dervish before customer can object.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Consideration</i>—The potential customer engages with your business, narrowing their choices by comparing you to other options. You make them see the superiority of your offering:</p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">“See that gray swirling water in our clear plastic canister? <i class="fm-italics">Your vacuum</i> left that behind!”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Conversion</i>—You convince them, turning them into a customer:</p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">“The Dervish model is the only vacuum on the market that uses water. What cleans better than water?”</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">“But the water stays in that cannister and never actually touches the carpet?”</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">“Never mind that. Sign here.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="body">The funnel process is illustrated in figure 12.1.</p>

</div>
<p class="body">In the real world of brick-and-mortar sales, it can be more difficult to identify and measure the stages of funneling (this imprecision is true of analytics in general when applied to real-world scenarios).</p>
<p class="body">But you <i class="fm-italics">can</i> get deep data about how people behave <i class="fm-italics">online</i>. You can get reports and maps of their interaction with your site—both individually as well as collectively as an average of all visitors. This is similar to setting up and recording focus groups in real-world situations.</p>
<p class="body">You can see where they go as they funnel down to your call to action (CTA; the conversion phase). This way you can modify your site to create a really effective funnel and thus make your site more successful. Do they tend to exit your site at a particular location in the funnel? Patch that to close the exit.<a id="idIndexMarker004"/></p>
<p class="body">One example of useful analytic data is geographical information. You can base advertising on the fact that Southerners in the United States don’t eat bagels for breakfast, and Northerners don’t even know what grits <i class="fm-italics">are</i>. And few in Europe know what the US’s ranch dressing is. If your site has certain pages directed solely at various geographic areas, you’ll know what content and ads to put in those pages.</p>
<p class="body">Analytics can be quite helpful in modifying your site to improve both the user experience (UX) and attaining your goals. For another example, analytics can reveal that when checking out of your site, there is a particular place during the shopping cart process where many users slow down and get confused. Or worse, they give up and leave. Fix this. Eliminate the problem. And subsequent analysis will quickly reveal whether or not that roadblock has been removed.<a id="idIndexMarker005"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_4">12.1.1 AI enters the picture</h3>
<p class="body">One important capability in AI’s skill set is deep data mining (aka big data analytics). AI can search vast amounts of data and discover relationships, anomalies, and patterns that no human would notice. And it can also use these insights to make accurate predictions.<a id="idIndexMarker006"/><a id="idIndexMarker007"/><a id="marker-295"/></p>
<p class="body">For instance, Amazon, with its 300 million customers, looks at your purchase history and then finds others who bought the same things, and in the same order. Amazon can then predict and recommend which items you’re likely to buy next.</p>
<p class="body">Amazon’s deep data miner maybe saw that several of your identical twin doppelgänger customers bought a 55-inch Hisense TV, and two days later bought an over-the-air antenna for it. So, when you buy that TV, Amazon politely displays what it calls Frequently Bought Together items (by your twins), Top Deals, and Categories to Explore. So it shows you a picture of the antenna.</p>
<p class="body">I couldn’t come up with a good analogy to illustrate the difference between human shallow data mining and AI deep data mining. So I turned to my creative writing assistant, Ms. Gemini Advanced. (Near the end of this chapter, Ms. G. will compare AI’s data analysis capabilities to human efforts. Guess who Gemini says is superior?)</p>

<p class="fm-exercise">Imagine a data set as a vast, dark forest filled with hidden pathways and concealed creatures. Traditional analysis is like exploring this forest with a flashlight – you can only see what’s directly in front of you. AI deep data analysis, on the other hand, is like deploying a swarm of intelligent drones throughout the forest. These drones fly at different altitudes, use various sensors like infrared and night vision, and communicate with each other. They rapidly map pathways, identify camouflaged creatures, and uncover complex relationships that no single human, even with the best flashlight, could ever discover within the dense, expansive forest of data.</p>

<p class="body">AI-powered analytics yields novel and contextual insights into how to take your site from good to great. AI can help you choose a good color scheme, edit your writing for clarity and concision, and so many other factors that contribute to a website’s success. And always remember, AI is being used by your competitors. So, you need it too.</p>
<p class="body">Writer’s block? No problem. No design experience? Solved. Recall that you now have a roomful of highly skilled assistants. You give them an assignment, and they come back with superior, often stunning, results.</p>
<p class="body">Among its benefits, AI is rapid, automated, and communicates with us in natural human language. No programming needs to be involved. As Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s president, said, today’s “programming language is human, everybody in the world is now a programmer.” By the way, human-computer communication is no longer a specialized skill. So don’t be tempted to try to make a career of it.<a id="idIndexMarker008"/><a id="idIndexMarker009"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_5">12.2 Understanding the elements of analytics</h2>
<p class="body">In the following subsections, you’ll see the traditional WordPress website analytics categories. Plus, you’ll learn what they reveal, and why those revelations are of value to a site designer.<a id="marker-296"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_6">12.2.1 Page views</h3>
<p class="body">Page views refers to the total number of times a page on a website is viewed or reloaded by visitors. Each load or reload counts as a page view, even if one visitor repeatedly revisits a particular page. (A browser page refresh—F5—also usually counts as a view. Some analytics platforms do have settings or filters to exclude duplicate page views generated by quick refreshes.) This tells you the comparative popularity of your various pages. And looking at how page view numbers change over time tells you whether your site’s audience is growing or shrinking. This doesn’t, however, let you know how many unique visitors are viewing the pages. <a id="idIndexMarker010"/><a id="idIndexMarker011"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_7">12.2.2 Unique visitors</h3>
<p class="body">The unique visitors count reveals how often a specific device—phone, tablet, computer, whatever—visits your site within a defined time period. And importantly, even if someone visits your site many times during that period, they only get counted once.<a id="idIndexMarker012"/><a id="idIndexMarker013"/></p>
<p class="body">How do analytics systems know if the same visitor comes more than once? Cookies are saved in the visitor’s browser to store the IP address of their device. IP addresses are a unique identifier of each device. From this metric, you learn your audience’s true size. It also tells you how many visitors are new and how many are returning. This way, you can see your retention rate too.</p>
<p class="body">If you launch a marketing campaign, for example, you can see what impact it has on driving new traffic to the site. To sum up: where <i class="fm-italics">page views</i> reveal the relative popularity of your content, <i class="fm-italics">unique visitors</i> tells you how many different visitors are looking at that content. More information on page views versus unique visitors is available at <a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/BXYq">https://mng.bz/BXYq</a>.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_8">12.2.3 Bounce rate</h3>
<p class="body">The bounce rate describes the percentage of people who leave without going past the home page. As you know, your home page is the first impression people will have. It must be inviting, trustworthy (testimonials), and efficient (intuitive navigation), and it must clearly announce your site’s purpose. Ultra clarity is essential (ensure that your headline and main image immediately make obvious the purpose and value of the site). And make certain that your pages load rapidly. Test your page load speed at PageSpeed Insights (<a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/dXxz">https://mng.bz/dXxz</a>). Remember that many potential visitors around the world will likely have slower internet connections than you do.<a id="idIndexMarker014"/><a id="marker-297"/><a id="idIndexMarker015"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> One common home-page mistake is using a “clever, catchy, or poetic” site title like <i class="fm-italics">Lazy Afternoons</i> or <i class="fm-italics">Whispering Windchimes.</i> Nobody knows what these titles mean! As the British say, they are <i class="fm-italics">too clever by half.</i> Instead, plainly state in the title what your site is about: Bass Fishing in North Carolina’s Randleman Lake. People don’t visit your front page to solve a puzzle. They want to know instantly if your site is where they should be.</p>
<p class="body">The bounce rate tells you how many people don’t click links, visit other pages, click a menu item, or trigger any other events in the site that the analytics system is tracking. You learn whether your home page effectively provides clear, useful, relevant information. It must lure them into your site. Does the home page load slowly or have broken links? Is your site title and tagline misleading, confusing, or vague? Is the design or content simply not what the visitors are looking for?</p>
<p class="body">It’s also thought that bounce rate can affect AIO and SEO, given that if people quickly flee, that can signal that your site isn’t relevant or valuable. However, this isn’t considered a major AIO/SEO factor.</p>
<p class="body">The average bounce rate is 50% and usually ranges from 40% to 60%. Blogs, however, are unique because they display a collection of messages, and many people might be happy with your offering, but read only one or two messages. They then never go beyond the home page and are counted as a bounce. Even though 50% is an average, bounce rates can vary significantly in different types of sites, topics, and industries. It’s best to compare your site’s bounce rate to other sites in your category.</p>
<p class="body">Interior page bounce rates can also be part of an analytics package. And, you need to interpret this data based on the page’s purpose. Some pages can have a high bounce rate merely because they contain little content or are the target of your CTA, so visitors are expected to exit from that page and go nowhere else in the site. They’ve filled out the form or made the purchase. Obviously, a shopping site’s purchase summary (Place Order button) is one such page. Bounce rates are irrelevant on the last page of your CTA because the visitor has “converted” into a lead (given you their email address, for example) or become a customer.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_9">12.2.4 Average session duration</h3>
<p class="body">Average session duration measures the average amount of time that your visitors remain on your site during their sessions. This is an indication of how much visitors value your site. This average is calculated by adding all the durations between all the visitors’ entrances and exits, and then dividing this total by the number of visitors.<a id="idIndexMarker016"/><a id="idIndexMarker017"/><a id="marker-298"/></p>
<p class="body">If people leave quickly, you might want to look at your design, content quality, navigation efficiency, or page load speeds. As with most of these metrics, don’t look at duration in isolation. Perhaps a visitor lingered because they were confused about how to find what they came for. Several other metrics also measure engagement, so take them into account as well.</p>
<p class="body">Some analytics programs use different terminology, such as <i class="fm-italics">time on site</i>. Individual page duration is also measurable, but how long visitors stay on the last page viewed when they leave the site can’t be measured. This is because durations are calculated by subtracting the time of a prior page load event from the subsequent one. And when they leave, there will be no subsequent page load event inside your site. Or if someone goes out for dinner or otherwise leaves the computer inactive, the analytic system will close the session after 30 minutes of inactivity. (That’s the Google Analytics default, but you can customize it.)</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_10">12.2.5 Conversion rates</h3>
<p class="body">How many people complete your desired goal, such as giving you their email address, signing up for your newsletter, buying something, or otherwise responding to your CTA? This is an important metric, providing you with the percentage of your visitors who are converted, and thus the <i class="fm-italics">effectiveness</i> of your site. The conversion rate is calculated by dividing the total number of visitors by the total number of conversions, and then multiplying by 100. For example, if an e-commerce site has 3,000 visitors, and 100 of them buy something, the conversion rate is (100 ÷ 3000) × 100 = 3.3%. <a id="idIndexMarker018"/><a id="idIndexMarker019"/></p>
<p class="body">It’s thought that the conversion rate is usually the single best measure of site performance, particularly for sites designed to achieve a business or professional purpose (as opposed to sites such as personal blogs). A high rate means that your site’s design and content are performing well. A low rate means there is work to be done to improve one or more elements of the site. You try different tactics, modifications, and CTAs and watch what happens to your rate.</p>
<p class="body">Do remember, however, that conversion rates vary significantly for different businesses and industries. The average across the board is estimated to be between 2.35% and 5.31%. But the conversion rate is most useful as a way for you to see trends in <i class="fm-italics">your</i> site’s performance over time as you make adjustments.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_11">12.2.6 Click path</h3>
<p class="body">Click paths (aka clickstreams, heatmaps, behavior flows, user flows, or path explorations) tell you how visitors traverse your site—their pathway within or among your site’s pages. (Some analytics applications can track intrapage movements such as local links or scrolling.) This data can identify where users abandon or hesitate when arriving at your CTA, locations where nobody ever goes, navigation issues (Do people get stuck in a particular place? Or get caught in a loop?), exit the site while making a purchase, and so on.<a id="idIndexMarker020"/><a id="marker-299"/><a id="idIndexMarker021"/></p>
<p class="body">There are two issues, however: (1) people don’t travel through the web in a linear fashion, so there might not be a single typical pathway in your site, and (2) tracking users can raise privacy concerns.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_12">12.3 Tracking options</h2>
<p class="body">Analytic data includes several tracking metrics that let you see how specific components of your site are performing. The following subsections describe typical types of tracking data. However, depending on your site’s contents and the analytics platform you’re using, there can be additional tracking categories.<a id="idIndexMarker022"/><a id="idIndexMarker023"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_13">12.3.1 Form submission tracking</h3>
<p class="body">Would you like to see if your efforts to gather leads and build an email list are actually doing their job? Form submission tracking shows you just that, so you can adjust your strategy as needed.<a id="idIndexMarker024"/><a id="idIndexMarker025"/><a id="idIndexMarker026"/></p>
<p class="body">This metric shows how many visitors are completing and submitting forms on your website, such as contact forms, lead capture forms, or signup forms. This shows how many potential leads or customers you’re generating from your website. It can help identify which pages or marketing campaigns are driving the most form submissions and conversions.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_14">12.3.2 Google Ads tracking</h3>
<p class="body">Google Ads tracking allows you to monitor the performance of any Google Ads campaigns you’re running. This includes metrics such as clicks, impressions, costs, and conversions. This data reveals which keywords and advertisements are attracting the most useful traffic and leads to your website, so you can optimize your Google Ads strategy.<a id="idIndexMarker027"/><a id="idIndexMarker028"/><a id="idIndexMarker029"/></p>
<p class="body">If you’re investing in Google Ads to reach new customers, you need to know if that money is being well spent. Google Ads tracking does exactly that. It tells you which ads and strategies are generating interest and results, and which ones need work. This helps you get the best possible return on your advertising investment.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_15">12.3.3 File downloads tracking</h3>
<p class="body">File download tracking records when visitors download files from your website, such as whitepapers, e-books, or product brochures. This can indicate interest in your content and help you understand which resources are most popular with your audience. It provides insights into content engagement.<a id="idIndexMarker030"/><a id="idIndexMarker031"/><a id="idIndexMarker032"/><a id="marker-300"/></p>
<p class="body">If you offer downloads, you want to know if people actually find them useful. File download tracking shows you which resources visitors want to learn more about. This tells you what topics your audience cares about and helps you cater your content to their needs.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_16">12.3.4 Video plays tracking</h3>
<p class="body">Video plays tracking monitors when visitors watch videos on your website. You’ll see which videos are engaging your audience the most and how long they are watching each one. You can then improve viewer engagement by offering the most popular videos.<a id="idIndexMarker033"/><a id="idIndexMarker034"/><a id="idIndexMarker035"/></p>
<p class="body">Video is an important medium. It’s a primary form of communication these days. Video plays tracking helps you see how your videos are doing. Is there a point where many viewers quit? Are some videos viewed more than others? Replace the weak ones.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_17">12.3.5 Outbound link tracking</h3>
<p class="body">Outbound link tracking records the external sites that visitors go to after clicking links in your website. This tells you about your audience’s interests and content preferences. It’s generally considered best to keep people in your site until they convert, but sending your visitors to other helpful resources is sometimes the right thing to do. You might also want to contact the administrator of a popular target site and offer to collaborate. Have them link to your site, for example.<a id="idIndexMarker036"/><a id="idIndexMarker037"/><a id="idIndexMarker038"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_18">12.3.6 Affiliate link performance tracking</h3>
<p class="body">If you have an affiliate marketing program, affiliate link performance tracking allows you to see clicks and conversions on those affiliate links. This data can help you identify which affiliates are driving the most valuable traffic and sales to your site. This way, you can focus on those partnerships that bring real value.<a id="idIndexMarker039"/><a id="idIndexMarker040"/><a id="idIndexMarker041"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_19">12.3.7 Age, sex, and interest reports</h3>
<p class="body">Knowing who your website attracts is important info. These reports provide insights into what your audience cares about, as well as their age, sex, and interests. Modify your content, design, and marketing strategies to align with your demographic. <a id="idIndexMarker042"/><a id="idIndexMarker043"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_20">12.3.8 Average scroll depth</h3>
<p class="body">Average scroll depth tracks how far down a page visitors scroll on average. This metric can indicate which content is most engaging and where you may need to optimize layout and formatting to keep visitors moving further down the page. Where exactly do people tend to lose interest on your pages? Are most taking off before they reach your important CTA? Are big wads of gray text scaring them away? Usually, you want them to keep scrolling, not jumping out of the page.<a id="idIndexMarker044"/><a id="idIndexMarker045"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_21">12.3.9 The value of tracking</h3>
<p class="body">Overall, tracking measurements give you a comprehensive view of how visitors are interacting with your website, what content and features are resonating, and where there are opportunities to improve the UX and drive more conversions. These insights will guide your site optimization and marketing strategies.<a id="idIndexMarker046"/><a id="marker-301"/><a id="idIndexMarker047"/></p>
<p class="body">You’ll understand how best to turn casual visitors into loyal followers or paying customers. It may seem a bit technical at first, but the benefits are huge. Don’t be afraid to analyze the results and experiment with adjustments to the site based on what you learn. With a little practice, website analytics can likely become your secret weapon for online success!</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_22">12.3.10 Analytics via AI</h3>
<p class="body">It’s no longer news that AI is revolutionizing the world. Or, as Bill Gates puts it, AI is “the first technology that has no limit.” And web analytics is no exception. <a id="idIndexMarker048"/><a id="idIndexMarker049"/><a id="idIndexMarker050"/><a id="idTextAnchor003"/></p>
<p class="body">No matter if you’re drawn to MonsterInsights’ or Site Kit’s beginner-friendly approaches; Googl<a id="idTextAnchor004"/>e’s robust, extensive, and deep data analysis; or Crazy Egg’s impressive and valuable visual maps, they’ll all help you unlock the hidden potential of your website. You can actually benefit from all four.</p>
<p class="body">By harnessing AI-powered analytics, you won’t simply watch <i class="fm-italics">Matrix</i>-like masses of numbers flickering as they scroll past. You’ll instead gain a deep understanding of your audience via visualizations, reports, tables, maps, lists, A/B testing, and real-time monitoring. This empowers you to make smarter decisions about your content, design, and overall marketing strategy.</p>
<p class="body">As a WordPress site developer, these tools give you a significant edge to create websites that truly resonate with your visitors and drive success. MonsterInsights claims you can <i class="fm-italics">double</i> your audience and sales via analytics: “It’s Easy to Double Your Traffic and Sales!” This might be a bit of marketing enthusiasm, but Monster <i class="fm-italics">is</i> a solid performer.</p>
<p class="body">Outfits such as Google are madly trying to put AI to work in their services—from search to analytics to anything else that they sell. For example, Google’s traditional list of links has a new feature. These days when you do a Google search, you can look down just below the “sponsored” links and click a Generate button with a Get an AI Overview of This Search label. Or, you may not even see the list of links anymore! Just pure AI responses to questions.</p>
<p class="body">And, Microsoft’s Bing (formerly just a Google clone) is now integrated with <i class="fm-italics">Copilot</i>, their name for AI. Do a Bing search and, as Microsoft puts it “Copilot consolidates reliable sources across the web to give you a single, summarized answer. Search in a way that feels natural to how you talk, text, and think.”</p>
<p class="body">The race is on. Specialized systems such as Google Analytics are also being packed with AI features. Today’s companies realize that they either embrace AI, or they go out of business. Same is true with people: either you employ AI in your work, or you’ll be out of work.</p>
<p class="body">Understanding how people use your website is usually essential for success. But digging through raw data can be overwhelming. That’s where powerful WordPress analytics plugins with AI capabilities come in. These tools go beyond traditional number-crunching, using AI to transform masses of raw visitor data into clear insights that you can easily understand and then act on to boost your site’s performance. No matter how you define <i class="fm-italics">performance</i>.<a id="idIndexMarker051"/><a id="idIndexMarker052"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_23">12.4 Four excellent analytics plugins</h2>
<p class="body">The four leading WordPress analytics plugins described in the following subsections put that AI analytic power right at your fingertips. These are all good, but they are listed here in order of value as I see it. Crazy Egg (<a class="url" href="https://www.crazyegg.com/pricing">www.crazyegg.com/pricing</a>), for example, provides unique and valuable insights, but it doesn’t come cheap.<a id="idIndexMarker053"/><a id="marker-302"/><a id="idIndexMarker054"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_24">12.4.1 MonsterInsights</h3>
<p class="body">Google Analytics is the go-to WordPress analytics system, the gold standard. But along with its depth and power comes complexity—for example, you have to add programming code to your WordPress files. That’s not something you’ll likely want to tackle. Enter MonsterInsights (<a class="url" href="https://www.monsterinsights.com">www.monsterinsights.com</a>) with its more than 3 million active installations. It assists in both code setup for Google Analytics and makes using Google Analytics easy to work with going forward. You get an efficient, understandable frontend interface for Google Analytics, including simplification and clarification of the complex and advanced features found in Google Analytics.<a id="idIndexMarker055"/><a id="idIndexMarker056"/><a id="idIndexMarker057"/></p>
<p class="body">MonsterInsights is a combination of setup wizard, summarizer, and frontend for Google Analytics. It actually makes using that powerhouse pretty easy.</p>
<p class="body">Monster also adds some features of its own, including General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance assistance and e-commerce tracking. What’s more, with Monster, you can view Google’s reports and summaries right there in your WordPress Dashboard.<a id="idIndexMarker058"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> The EU’s GDPR privacy protection initiative requires you to request permission from your audience before collecting data from them. Monster makes it easy for you to display to your visitors an opt-out option for this.</p>
<p class="body">Monster describes itself like this: “MonsterInsights makes it ‘effortless’ to set up Google Analytics in WordPress, the RIGHT Way. Simply install the plugin and enable the features you want with just a few clicks, no coding needed!” and “MonsterInsights shows you the Stats that Matter!”</p>
<p class="body">You’ll also get over a dozen useful summaries that tell you what the raw data actually means, including landing page, funnel, and audience reports. Monster displays several potent AI-powered features in your WordPress Dashboard:</p>

<p class="fm-head2">Google Analytics and Google Site Kit</p>
<p class="body">Google offers a suite of powerful analytics tools, and you can easily integrate them into your WordPress site by using MonsterInsights or Google’s own Site Kit plugin. Google Analytics is the industry-leading platform that uses AI to identify trends, anomalies, and potential opportunities based on your website’s traffic patterns. This helps you understand your audience better and tailor your content accordingly.<a id="idIndexMarker064"/><a id="idIndexMarker065"/><a id="idIndexMarker066"/><a id="idIndexMarker067"/><a id="idIndexMarker068"/></p>

<p class="body">Crazy Egg takes a uniquely visual approach to website analytics. It combines traditional data with advanced AI features, including easily understood visual representations (maps) of its analytic data. Here are some of this system’s special features:<a id="idIndexMarker079"/><a id="idIndexMarker080"/><a id="idIndexMarker081"/><a id="marker-305"/></p>

</ul>
<p class="fm-head2">Crazy Egg’s maps</p>
<p class="body">In the Crazy Egg WordPress plugin, special heatmaps display, <i class="fm-italics">visually</i>, how users are interacting with your pages. You see a color-coded overlay, with hotter colors (such as red and orange) indicating areas of high-click density, and “cooler” colors (blue and green) showing areas with less engagement. Just by looking at these maps, you can quickly understand which elements of your website are attracting the most attention, which are being ignored, and how visitors are interacting with your content in general. Take a look at the various types of maps here: <a class="url" href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/crazy-egg-features/">www.crazyegg.com/blog/crazy-egg-features/</a>.<a id="idIndexMarker087"/></p>

</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Scroll maps</i>—These show how far users scroll down a web page. Among other things, this will tell you where to put a Buy Now button and similar CTAs.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Confetti report</i>—You see your page with colored dots that represent where visitors clicked in the web page.

<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Assess user behavior</i>—Visualize scrolling and mouse movements as well as clicks. This reveals how users use and navigate your website.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_27">12.5 AI as site critic</h2>
<p class="body">Throughout this book, we’ve called upon AI as a critic to suggest improvements to our practice sites’ design and content. Likewise, you can have AI critique your site by cutting your text content and page designs, and then pasting them into a prompt.<a id="idIndexMarker098"/><a id="idIndexMarker099"/></p>
<p class="body">But cutting and pasting doesn’t give you every kind of information you’ll need to improve your site. It doesn’t reveal some large-scale issues such as site navigation and organization, or technical issues such as page load speed and accessibility.</p>
<p class="body">You’ll also want to compare your site’s <i class="fm-italics">depth of information</i> to other sites focused on your topic. This shows you how well your site engages your audience and how consistently the overall content and design harmonize with the site’s identity and goals.</p>
<p class="body">Yes, excellent plugins such as MonsterInsights can answer most of these kinds of questions. But it’s great to just submit your site address to an AI and have it scan and critique the site. This way, AI views your site as an organic whole, just like humans do.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_28">12.5.1 What are AI agents?</h3>
<p class="body">At the time of this writing, AI systems are just starting to offer <i class="fm-italics">agents</i>. These differ from simpler, traditional AI assistance in several key ways:<a id="marker-307"/><a id="idIndexMarker100"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">AI agents are goal oriented. They perform complete tasks, rather than just responding to a prompt with information. For example, instead of reading some of your text content that you pasted into a prompt, an agent could actually <i class="fm-italics">visit</i> your site. When finished experiencing your site as a human would, AI can judge more abstract qualities such as the interrelationships <i class="fm-italics">between</i> your design, media, and text content. AI can critique site structure by looking at the navigation paths, and judge global issues like whether the entire site holds together organically (visually, writing style, redundancy, and so on). GPT-4o and greater can visit and scan sites, as described in chapter 11, section 11.2.2.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">AI agents can use chain-of-thought reasoning to figure out on their own what steps to take to reach a goal—even a complex, multistep goal—without further prompting or assistance from you. In other words, they can behave autonomously and proactively. They are let loose into the real world.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Your prompting can be simpler. For example, if you merely tell an agent to suggest improvements to your site, it could make its own decisions about how to do that. It might visit multiple competing sites without your telling it to, so it can compare your site to its competitors. It might check for visual appeal or plagiarism without being asked to do those things. Agents are self-starters and provide intelligent feedback on their own. AI agents can autonomously create subgoals, intermediate steps, without requiring human guidance. Your prompts can be short because all you need to do is describe a goal, and the AI will figure what it needs to do to reach that goal. Agents can also learn from the environment. Ultimately, they’ll be able to use sensors and learn from all types of real-world input. Watch movies. Listen to Mozart or Muse. Just like us. OpenAI took a big step in this direction with the release of GPT-4o in spring 2024. It accepts multimodal input and provides multimodal output (except for music and video, currently).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">AI agents are a more advanced and autonomous form of AI, with the ability to reason, learn, change course, traverse the internet, and make independent decisions. They don’t need a script to follow or multiple prompts from you. This makes them flexible, adapting to changes on the fly, and tackling the unpredictable and sometimes complicated nature of real-world situations. High human intelligence is sometimes described as primarily <i class="fm-italics">adaptability</i>. In this way, AI agency is a step in the direction of artificial general intelligence (AGI). <a id="idIndexMarker101"/></p>
<p class="body">When programming a computer, you can make a program’s behavior somewhat adaptable by using If/Then and Do/While statements. Similarly, when prompting AI in the traditional way, you can make it somewhat adaptable by specifying what to do if a decision must be made and how many times to repeat the behavior: “Write a love poem. If it doesn’t feel quite right, then provide five revised versions using different styles.” Then traditional AI responses display the five versions, and you must pick the best one. And this kind of predictive rule setting can’t take into account every possible decision that needs to be made.</p>
<p class="body">By contrast, an AI agent would <i class="fm-italics">by itself</i> decide how many drafts to write and which one is best. In this way, we humans become no longer necessary. When full AI agency arrives—likely in 2025—the part we’ll play is to simply express our wishes. Then AI does the job. This will continue to be our interrelationship with AI as long as it permits.</p>

<p class="body">Gemini has a helpful feature called <i class="fm-italics">double-check response</i> that does just that. Click the G icon in the row of icons at the bottom of a Gemini response. Then, Gemini looks again at its response, cross-checking its accuracy. <a id="idIndexMarker107"/></p>
<p class="body">Gemini highlights these areas in the text. Text highlighted in green means Gemini found content that’s similar to what it gave you, indicating substantiation of its response. Orange means the text might be accurate, but lacks clarity or depth. Red (this actually looks brown) means support for the assertion couldn’t be found, so its response is either misleading or inaccurate.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> While this highlighting can be useful, it doesn’t seem to flag plagiarism. I recommend that you use Grammarly to check for plagiarism. Grammarly quickly scans billions of web pages and also scans the ProQuest database. The ProQuest company offers searchable content that’s not necessarily on the internet directly, such as scholarly journals, dissertations, historical documents, theses, newspapers, e-books, and other research materials.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_30">12.6.1 Getting better AI responses</h3>
<p class="body">With AI, if you need a better answer, try slowing things down, chatting back and forth to steer AI in the right direction, and taking several steps to improve the final response. This will allow you to focus and verify the results. Recall that this prompting technique is referred to as chain of thought (aka logical decomposition, step-by-step reasoning, reasoning breakdown, or sequential reasoning).<a id="idIndexMarker108"/><a id="idIndexMarker109"/><a id="idIndexMarker110"/><a id="marker-309"/></p>

<p class="fm-exercise">Unique Visitors</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Unique Visitors refers to the number of new, unduplicated visitors to your website over a given period of time. This metric helps you understand the reach and growth of your site, as it excludes repeat visitors. By tracking Unique Visitors, you can gauge how successful your marketing and content strategies are at attracting new audiences. A steady increase in Unique Visitors indicates that your site is expanding its reach and resonating with more people. This data can inform decisions around content creation, advertising campaigns, and other growth initiatives.<a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker114"/></p><!--<p class="fm-exercise-break">  </p>-->
<p class="fm-exercise">Bounce Rate</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Bounce Rate is the percentage of visitors who go away from your website after viewing only the home page (or a single interior page). A high Bounce Rate can mean there are issues with your site’s content, design, or user experience. Conversely, a low Bounce Rate suggests that visitors are engaged and exploring your site further. By analyzing Bounce Rate, you can identify pages or entry points that are failing to capture visitor interest and make improvements to enhance engagement. This data is an indicator of how effectively your website is retaining and converting visitors.<a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker115"/></p><!--<p class="fm-exercise-break">  </p>-->
<p class="fm-exercise">Conversion Rate</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Conversion Rate measures the percentage of visitors who complete your call to action, such as buying something. This metric shows the effectiveness of your site in achieving your business goals. A high Conversion Rate indicates that your website is successfully guiding visitors through the sales funnel or conversion process. By monitoring Conversion Rate, you can assess the performance of your calls to action, landing pages, and overall user experience, and make informed modifications to get the best results.<a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker116"/></p><!--<p class="fm-exercise-break">  </p>-->
<p class="fm-exercise">Conclusion</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Together, Unique Visitors, Bounce Rate, and Conversion Rate provide a comprehensive view of your website’s performance, helping you understand your audience, identify areas that need work, and reveal the success of your site. By closely tracking and analyzing these key metrics, you can make solid decisions that will result in the best user engagement, drive more conversions, and ultimately, achieve your business objectives.</p>

<p class="body"><a id="marker-311"/>In this chapter, we explored the role of analytics in building and retaining an audience for a website. We looked at various elements of analytics, such as page views, unique visitors, bounce rate, and conversion rate. The chapter emphasized the value of tracking user behavior and how AI revolutionizes analytics by providing deep data mining and the resulting insights no human could discover. We compared four popular WordPress analytics plugins: MonsterInsights, Google Site Kit, Google Analytics, and Crazy Egg, highlighting their features and benefits. Finally, we saw how AI agents and employing multiple AIs could offer valuable feedback as well.<a id="idIndexMarker118"/><a id="idIndexMarker119"/><a id="idIndexMarker120"/><a id="idIndexMarker121"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_31">Summary</h2>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Along with everything else cultural or cerebral, AI is now improving website <i class="fm-italics">analytics</i>—the process of collecting, measuring, analyzing, and then providing to us human site designers very valuable information. This data can help you greatly improve your site. You’re told in detail what your visitors are like and how they’re interacting with your site.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">A <i class="fm-italics">purchase funnel</i> creates a pathway that guides your visitors to the target of your site’s CTA. Whether you want them to subscribe to your newsletter, download digital content, give you their email address, or just buy something—this funnel is how you can move them from your home page to where they take action you want them to take.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">AI can do deep data mining. This is an advanced form of data analysis that humans are not capable of. It employs deep learning techniques (a powerful form of AI) to uncover complex, hidden patterns and relationships within a massive collection of data.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Analytics can <i class="fm-italics">track</i> various elements in your site—ads, scrolling, downloads, forms, and other components—and report how well they’re performing. You’ll learn in specific detail how your visitors interact with your site.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">You’ll want to explore the four top WordPress analytics plugins: MonsterInsights, Site Kit, Google Analytics, and Crazy Egg. The first two are designed to simplify using the third because Google Analytics is vast, powerful, and, consequently, complex. MonsterInsights and Site Kit tame the Google beast and make understanding the data and metrics much easier. The fourth recommended plugin, Crazy Egg, offers unique and significant feedback via visualizations. You’ll <i class="fm-italics">see</i> the data rather than read it.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Although analytic information via plugins can be excellent, sometimes they’re too granular. Sometimes, you’ll want a global, overall critique of your site, as if an expert human critic summarized your strengths and weaknesses. You’ll want to employ the new, emerging AI <i class="fm-italics">agents</i>. They’re a more advanced and autonomous form of AI, with the ability to reason, learn, change course, traverse the internet, and make independent decisions <i class="fm-italics">on their own</i>. You merely give them a goal (“provide an in-depth critique of my site”), and they figure out how best to achieve that goal.<a id="marker-312"/></p>
