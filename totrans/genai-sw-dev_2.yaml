- en: The world of software applications depends on beautiful *user interfaces (UI)*
    and intuitive *user experiences (UX)*. UI design is about how a product looks
    and how users interact with it visually. It focuses on layout, colors, buttons,
    typography, and everything that shapes the visual experience of a software product.
    UX design, on the other hand, is about how a product feels to the user and if
    it is intuitive and efficient to use. UX is about usability, navigation flow,
    and making sure the overall experience is smooth and user-friendly. Both work
    hand in hand to create great software products.
  prefs: []

- en: Producing those interfaces and experiences has been the job of UI/UX designers
    for the last few decades. They usually pair with software engineers to implement
    the functionality and the backend workflows that bring those designs to life as
    an integrated experience for users around the world. Transforming UI/UX designs
    into functional frontend code is a labor-intensive process, though. Traditionally,
    designers and engineers work closely to ensure that the visual aesthetics of a
    design are accurately translated into a responsive, interactive user interface.
    This process often involves multiple iterations, meticulous attention to detail,
    and a deep understanding of both design principles and coding standards.

- en: Since the emergence of text-to-image generative AI models in 2022 and 2023,
    UI/UX design has witnessed an enormous transformation. As I write this in 2025,
    recent AI tools can now generate UI designs from ideas described in natural language
    *and* generate functional frontend code from UI designs. These tools are revolutionizing
    the design-to-code workflow by automating significant portions of the process.
    This has immense potential to reduce the time and effort required to bring designs
    to life and make design professionals much more efficient. AI tools can significantly
    reduce the gap between concept and implementation.

- en: For example, the first iteration of wireframing and sketching designs for a
    new application can take more than a week to complete—sometimes more than a month,
    depending on the complexity of the project. The new AI design generators can cut
    wireframing time to less than a day and make each feedback loop faster as well.
    These tools’ ability to transform designs into functional frontend code means
    one person or team can go from describing an idea in natural language to generating
    functional frontend code within minutes (or hours, counting iterations), as opposed
    to weeks or months.

    it does a good job with the workflow, and it does deliver value for anyone who
    wants to crunch massive amounts of data into structured product insights to use
    in their next software-development iteration.

- en: Galileo AI emerged from my evaluation as the best text-to-UI tool among the
    20+ tools I evaluated, including the four featured in this chapter. Its ability
    to take an image and remake it into a beautiful design also makes it stand out.
    As I’ve noted, this space is still in its very early days, so I can only imagine
    how far these tools will evolve in the coming years.

    tools in this space to be very useful in their current state, given their newness.
    I was wrong. I’m now very excited about this space and the evolution in software
    development processes we’ll see in the coming months and years.

- en: Generating frontend code from designs, with the increasingly dominant use case
    of generating both design and working code from a prompt (as seen in Bolt.new
    and Lovable), is certainly the angle that best speaks to software engineers, especially
    those working on the frontend. It is a game-changer that will save software engineers
    around the world millions of hours.

    work. But think about it: our tools are becoming more powerful, and if it takes
    less time to do the same work, software engineers can manage a larger portion
    of design workflows. Indeed, our employers and team leads will likely ask us to
    do so more and more.'

    given the staggering pace of their development, I can foresee that many teams
    will no longer need specialized designers to produce lots of screens. Of course,
    specialized interactions, branded UI elements, or complex user-experience nuances
    will still be best served by specialized human UI/UX designers. But I can imagine
    that most standard app flows, such as registration flows, listings, and profile
    pages, will be well served by these AI tools.

    from the users of their products, structure that feedback into actionable insights,
    generate improved designs, transform them into code, and push a new iteration
    to production. Product iteration cycles will shorten significantly thanks to these
    tools. Professionals who master them will have much more market demand than those
    who stick to only writing code. As I write these lines in early 2025, I’m seeing
    big growth in the Product Engineer job title in recent months, which caters exactly
    to this opportunity I’m describing: software engineers who can understand the
    client’s needs, convert them into product feature descriptions, and ship the code
    that fulfils those descriptions.'

    between saving time writing code and spending more time debugging, fixing, and
    improving code. It’s not much different, conceptually, from the trade-offs of
    the HTML code generated by Dreamweaver in the early 2000s, or the more recent
    advent of low-code tools that generate templated code, which is often hard to
    customize and adapt to one’s specific needs.
