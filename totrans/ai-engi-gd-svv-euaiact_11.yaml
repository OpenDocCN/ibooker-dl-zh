    are designed and implemented in alignment with ethical principles. Their responsibilities
    include developing AI ethics values, guidelines, and frameworks (see the [Values
    Canvas](https://oreil.ly/c79Xu)), as well as conducting ethical impact assessments
    for AI projects. They address concerns related to bias, fairness, and transparency
    in AI systems and work closely with legal, compliance, and AI development teams.
    Staying up-to-date with AI ethics research and best practices is also a key part
    of their role.

    to ensure compliance with ethical and regulatory standards. This involves conducting
    audits to evaluate the fairness, transparency, and accountability of AI systems
    and benchmarking them against organizational policies and external regulations.
    The auditor provides recommendations for improving the compliance of AI systems
    and develops AI-specific audit frameworks and methodologies. Collaboration with
    AI ethics specialists and compliance officers is a vital aspect of this role.

- en: The role of a *legal AI compliance officer* or *AI regulatory affairs specialist*
    is to ensure that AI systems comply with applicable laws and regulations. This
    requires staying informed about evolving AI legislation, developing compliance
    strategies for AI initiatives, conducting legal risk assessments, and providing
    guidance on data privacy and AI transparency. They work closely with legal teams,
    AI development teams, and AI ethics specialists.

    ensure responsible management of data and AI assets. This includes creating data
    and AI governance frameworks, enforcing compliance with data protection regulations
    (such as GDPR and CCPA), establishing data quality and metadata management practices,
    and developing policies for AI model versioning and lifecycle management. They
    collaborate closely with data engineers, AI teams, and compliance officers to
    ensure the effective implementation of these policies.

    and mitigating risks associated with AI systems. This includes conducting risk
    assessments for AI projects and deployments, developing risk mitigation strategies,
    and continuously monitoring AI systems for potential risks and vulnerabilities.
    They collaborate with AI security specialists and compliance officers and provide
    risk-related insights to leadership to inform decision making.

- en: The *AI security specialist*ensures that AI systems are protected against threats
    and vulnerabilities. They implement security best practices in AI development
    and deployment, conduct security assessments of AI models and systems, and develop
    defenses against AI-specific threats such as model poisoning and adversarial attacks.
    They also monitor AI systems for security anomalies and collaborate closely with
    cybersecurity teams and MLOps engineers to maintain the security of AI systems.

- en: The core principles of Team Topologies guide effective team organization and
    dynamics. A key principle is Conway’s law, which states that “organizations design
    systems that mirror their communication structures”—in other words, the structure
    of those systems tends to reflect the way teams are organized and interact. This
    highlights the importance of designing team structures intentionally to support
    desired system architectures.

- en: The Team Topologies framework also emphasizes the need for teams to handle only
    as much complexity as they can effectively manage, to avoid excessive cognitive
    load. Prioritizing collective intelligence over individual capacities encourages
    a team-first mindset. Team Topologies also promotes defining natural boundaries
    for team responsibilities and ensuring team encapsulation, with clear, well-defined
    interfaces. Finally, evolving team structures are essential to adapt to changes
    in technologies and organizational needs.

    domain team’s interaction modes range from collaboration to as-a-service delivery
    of ML solutions. With its expertise in advanced ML models and domain-specific
    tasks (e.g., retail forecasting, content recommendation, churn prediction), it
    operates as a collaborative unit within the organization. It also provides ML
    models and capabilities as a service to multiple stream-aligned teams, ensuring
    that teams across the organization can leverage ML expertise without duplicating
    effort.

- en: Now that you have a sense of the core team topologies and how they relate to
    AI teams, let’s see how this ties in with the EU AI Act. Team structures in AI
    teams are not static; they evolve based on the organization’s needs, scale, and
    maturity. As discussed earlier, ensuring compliance with AI regulations and supporting
    the development of trustworthy AI systems requires the introduction of new, specialized
    roles. The following subsections give a few examples of how these emerging ethics,
    compliance, and governance roles can be integrated into the Team Topologies framework
    as enabling teams or complicated subsystem teams.
