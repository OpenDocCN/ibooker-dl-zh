   <p><span class="UpCap CharOverride-1">Y</span>ou must be confident by now in building and evaluating a core RAG pipeline. Applications such as “chat with your PDF” or question-answering systems based on web pages should no longer be a mystery. This part of the book will guide you in improving your RAG pipeline and also lay out a blueprint for the layers required to build a production-ready RAG system.</p>

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p3"> 
   <p>In chapter 6, you’ll be able to try out different techniques for improving the basic RAG pipeline into a more advanced one. You’ll get to know the techniques that improve RAG in three different stages—before, during, and after retrieval. You’ll also learn about modularity and how modern RAG systems are made up of replaceable components. </p>

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p4"> 
   <p>Chapter 7 discusses the operations stack for RAG. You will learn about the critical layers without which any RAG system will fail, the essential layers that improve system performance, and the enhancement layers that focus on usability, scalability, and efficiency of the system. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p5"> 
   <p>By the end of this part, you should have the knowledge and skills to start building simple RAG systems and putting them into production. This is also the stage at which you are ready to explore deeper nuances and variations of RAG systems.</p>
