- en: We are experiencing a renaissance of artificial intelligence, and everyone and
    their neighbor wants to be a part of this movement. That’s quite likely why you
    are browsing through this book. There are tons of books about deep learning out
    there. So you might ask us, very reasonably, why does this book even exist? We’ll
    get to that in just a second.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During our own deep learning journeys since 2013 (while building products at
    companies including Microsoft, NVIDIA, Amazon, and Square), we witnessed dramatic
    shifts in this landscape. Constantly evolving research was a given and a lack
    of mature tooling was a reality of life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While growing and learning from the community, we noticed a lack of clear guidance
    on how to convert research to an end product for everyday users. After all, the
    end user is somewhere in front of a web browser, a smartphone, or an edge device.
    This often involved countless hours of hacking and experimentation, extensively
    searching through blogs, GitHub issue threads, and Stack Overflow answers, and
    emailing authors of packages to get esoteric knowledge, as well as occasional
    “Aha!” moments. Even the books on the market tended to focus more on theory or
    how to use a specific tool. The best we could hope to learn from the available
    books was to build a toy example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To fill this gap between theory and practice, we originally started giving talks
    on taking artificial intelligence from research to the end user with a particular
    focus on practical applications. The talks were structured to showcase motivating
    examples, as well as different levels of complexity based on skill level (from
    a hobbyist to a Google-scale engineer) and effort involved in deploying deep learning
    in production. We discovered that beginners and experts alike found value in these
    talks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over time, the landscape thankfully became accessible to beginners and more
    tooling became available. Great online material like Fast.ai and DeepLearning.ai
    made understanding how to train AI models easier than ever. Books also cornered
    the market on teaching fundamentals using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow
    and PyTorch. But even with all of this, the wide chasm between theory and production
    remained largely unaddressed. And we wanted to bridge this gap. Thus, the book
    you are now reading.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using approachable language as well as ready-to-run fun projects in computer
    vision, the book starts off with simple classifiers assuming no knowledge of machine
    learning and AI, gradually building to add complexity, improve accuracy and speed,
    scale to millions of users, deploy on a wide variety of hardware and software,
    and eventually culminate in using reinforcement learning to build a miniature
    self-driving car.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nearly every chapter begins with a motivating example, establishes the questions
    upfront that one might ask through the process of building a solution, and discusses
    multiple approaches for solving problems, each with varying levels of complexity
    and effort involved. If you are seeking a quick solution, you might end up just
    reading a few pages of a chapter and be done. Someone wanting to gain a deeper
    understanding of the subject should read the entire chapter. Of course, everyone
    should peruse the case studies included in these chapters for two reasons—they
    are fun to read and they showcase how people in the industry are using the concepts
    discussed in the chapter to build real products.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also discuss many of the practical concerns faced by deep learning practitioners
    and industry professionals in building real-world applications using the cloud,
    browsers, mobile, and edge devices. We compiled a number of practical “tips and
    tricks,” as well as life lessons in this book to encourage our readers to build
    applications that can make someone’s day just a little bit better.

- en: This book came to life because of our development editor Nicole Taché’s efforts.
    She rooted for us throughout our journey and provided important guidance at each
    step of the process. She helped us prioritize the right material (believe it or
    not, the book was going to be even larger!) and ensured that we were on track.
    She was reader number one for every single draft that we had written, so our goal
    first and foremost was ensuring that she was able to follow the content, despite
    her being new to AI. We’re immensely grateful for her support.

- en: We also want to thank the rest of the O’Reilly team including our production
    editor Christopher Faucher who worked tireless hours on a tight schedule to ensure
    that this book made it to the printing press on time. We are also grateful to
    our copy editor Bob Russell who really impressed us with his lightning-fast edits
    and his attention to detail. He made us realize the importance of paying attention
    to English grammar in school (though a few years too late, we’re afraid). We also
    want to acknowledge Rachel Roumeliotis (VP of Content Strategy) and Olivia MacDonald
    (Managing Editor for Development) for believing in the project and for offering
    their continued support.

- en: Huge thanks are in order for our guest authors who brought in their technical
    expertise to share their passion for this field with our readers. Aditya Sharma
    and Mitchell Spryn (from Microsoft) showed us that our love for playing video
    racing games can be put to good use to train autonomous cars by driving them in
    a simulated environment (with AirSim). Sunil Mallya (from Amazon) helped bring
    this knowledge to the physical world by demonstrating that all it takes is one
    hour to assemble and get a miniature autonomous car (AWS DeepRacer) to navigate
    its way around a track using reinforcement learning. Sam Sterckval (from Edgise)
    summarized the vast variety of embedded AI hardware available in the market, so
    we can get a leg up on our next robotics project. And finally, Zaid Alyafeai (from
    King Fahd University) demonstrated that browsers are no less capable of running
    serious interactive AI models (with the help of TensorFlow.js and ml5js).

- en: 'The book is in its current shape because of timely feedback from our amazing
    technical reviewers, who worked tirelessly on our drafts, pointed out any technical
    inaccuracies they came across, and gave us suggestions on better conveying our
    ideas. Due to their feedback (and the ever-changing APIs of TensorFlow), we ended
    up doing a rewrite of a majority of the book from the original prerelease. We
    thank Margaret Maynard-Reid (Google Developer Expert for Machine Learning, you
    might have read her work while reading TensorFlow documentation), Paco Nathan
    (35+ years industry veteran at Derwin Inc., who introduced Anirudh to the world
    of public speaking), Andy Petrella (CEO and Founder at Kensu and creator of SparkNotebook
    whose technical insights stood up to his reputation), and Nikhita Koul (Senior
    Data Scientist at Adobe who read and suggested improvements after every iteration,
    effectively reading a few thousand pages, thus making the content significantly
    more approachable) for their detailed reviews of each chapter. Additionally, we
    also had a lot of help from reviewers with expertise in specific topics be it
    AI in the browser, mobile development, or autonomous cars. The chapter-wise reviewer
    list (in alphabetical order) is as follows:'

    support, resources, time, and freedom to pursue my passions. To all the hackers
    and researchers at Microsoft, Aira, and Yahoo who stood with me in turning ideas
    to prototypes to products, it’s not the successes but the hiccups which taught
    us a lot during our journey together. Our trials and tribulations provided glorious
    material for this book, enough to exceed our original estimate by an extra 250
    pages! To my academic families at Carnegie Mellon, Dalhousie, and Thapar University,
    you taught me more than just academics (unlike what my GPA might suggest). And
    to the blind and low-vision community, you inspired me daily to work in the AI
    field by demonstrating that armed with the right tools, people are truly limitless.”

    than I thought and more rewarding than I could have ever imagined.’ I am eternally
    grateful to my grandparents and family, Mom, Dad, and Shriya for advocating seeking
    out knowledge and helping me become the person I am today. To my wonderful collaborators
    and mentors from Carnegie Mellon University, CERN, NASA FDL, Deep Vision, NITH,
    and NVIDIA who were with me throughout my journey, I am indebted to them for teaching
    and helping develop a scientific temperament. To my friends, who I hope still
    remember me, as I’ve been pretty invisible as of late, I would like to say a big
    thanks for being incredibly patient. I hope to see you all around. To my friends
    who selflessly reviewed chapters of the book and acted as a sounding board, a
    huge thank you—without you, the book would not have taken shape.”

    support starting from the very beginning and their strong will to provide me with
    a good life and education. I am grateful to my professors from UF and VNIT who
    taught me well and made me glad that I majored in CS. I am thankful to my incredibly
    supportive partner Julia Tanner who, for nearly two years, had to endure nights
    and weekends of unending Skype calls with my coauthors, as well as my several
    terrible jokes (some of which unfortunately made it into this book). I’d also
    like to acknowledge the role of my wonderful manager Joel Kustka in supporting
    me during the process of writing this book. A shout out to my friends who were
    incredibly understanding when I couldn’t hang out with them as often as they would
    have liked me to.”
