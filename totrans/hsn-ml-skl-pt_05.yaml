    familiar with vectors and matrices—how to transpose them, multiply them, and invert
    them—as well as partial derivatives. If these concepts are unfamiliar, please
    review the introductory Jupyter notebooks on linear algebra and calculus provided
    in the [online supplemental material](https://github.com/ageron/handson-mlp).
    If you are truly allergic to math, you can just skip the equations; the text should

    formalism is extremely useful, as it will allow you to read ML papers. Although
    it may seem daunting at first, it’s actually not that hard, and this chapter includes

    that training a model means setting its parameters so that the model best fits
    the training set. For this purpose, we first need a measure of how well (or poorly)
    the model fits the training data. In [Chapter 2](ch02.html#project_chapter) we
    saw that the most common performance measure of a regression model is the root
    mean squared error ([Equation 2-1](ch02.html#rmse_equation)). Therefore, to train
    a linear regression model, we need to find the value of **θ** that minimizes the
    RMSE. In practice, it is simpler to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) than
    the RMSE, and it leads to the same result (because the value that minimizes a
    positive function also minimizes its square root).

    than the performance measure used to evaluate the final model. This is generally
    because the function is easier to optimize and/or because it has extra terms needed
    during training only (e.g., for regularization). A good performance metric is
    as close as possible to the final business objective. A good training loss is
    easy to optimize and strongly correlated with the metric. For example, classifiers
    are often trained using a cost function such as the log loss (as you will see

    to minimize, and doing so will usually improve precision/recall.

    descent, you need to compute the gradient of the cost function with regard to
    each model parameter *θ*[*j*]. In other words, you need to calculate how much
    the cost function will change if you change *θ*[*j*] just a little bit. This is
    called a *partial derivative*. It is like asking, “What is the slope of the mountain
    toward the east?” and then asking the same question facing north (and so on for
    all other dimensions, if you can imagine a universe with more than three dimensions).
    [Equation 4-6](#mse_partial_derivatives) computes the partial derivative of the
    MSE with regard to parameter *θ*[*j*], denoted ∂ MSE(**θ**) / ∂θ[*j*].

    training set to compute the gradients at every step, which makes it very slow
    when the training set is large. At the opposite extreme, *stochastic gradient
    descent* picks a random instance in the training set at every step and computes
    the gradients based only on that single instance. Obviously, working on a single
    instance at a time makes the algorithm much faster because it has very little
    data to manipulate at every iteration. It also makes it possible to train on huge
    training sets, since only one instance needs to be in memory at each iteration
    (stochastic GD can be implemented as an out-of-core algorithm; see [Chapter 1](ch01.html#landscape_chapter)).

    it gets there it will continue to bounce around, never settling down (see [Figure 4-9](#sgd_random_walk_diagram)).

    descent has a better chance of finding the global minimum than batch gradient
    descent does.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, randomness is good to escape from local optima, but bad because it
    means that the algorithm can never settle at the minimum. One solution to this
    dilemma is to gradually reduce the learning rate. The steps start out large (which
    helps make quick progress and escape local minima), then get smaller and smaller,
    allowing the algorithm to settle at the global minimum. This process is akin to
    *simulated annealing*, an algorithm inspired by the process in metallurgy of annealing,
    where molten metal is slowly cooled down. The function that determines the learning
    rate at each iteration is called the *learning schedule*. If the learning rate
    is reduced too quickly, you may get stuck in a local minimum, or even end up frozen
    halfway to the minimum. If the learning rate is reduced too slowly, you may jump
    around the minimum for a long time and end up with a suboptimal solution if you
    halt training too early.

    let’s look at the training error. When there are just one or two instances in
    the training set, the model can fit them perfectly, which is why the curve starts
    at zero. But as new instances are added to the training set, it becomes impossible
    for the model to fit the training data perfectly, both because the data is noisy
    and because it is not linear at all. So the error on the training data goes up
    until it reaches a plateau, at which point adding new instances to the training
    set doesn’t make the average error much better or worse. Now let’s look at the
    validation error. When the model is trained on very few training instances, it
    is incapable of generalizing properly, which is why the validation error is initially
    quite large. Then, as the model is shown more training examples, it learns, and
    thus the validation error slowly goes down. However, once again a straight line
    cannot do a good job of modeling the data, so the error ends up at a plateau,
    very close to the other curve.

    loss (|*θ*[1]| + |*θ*[2]|), which drops linearly as you get closer to any axis.
    For example, if you initialize the model parameters to *θ*[1] = 2 and *θ*[2] =
    0.5, running gradient descent will decrement both parameters equally (as represented
    by the dashed yellow line); therefore *θ*[2] will reach 0 first (since it was
    closer to 0 to begin with). After that, gradient descent will roll down the gutter
    until it reaches *θ*[1] = 0 (with a bit of bouncing around, since the gradients
    of ℓ[1] never get close to 0: they are either –1 or 1 for each parameter). In
    the top-right plot, the contours represent lasso regression’s cost function (i.e.,
    an MSE cost function plus an ℓ[1] loss). The small white circles show the path
    that gradient descent takes to optimize some model parameters that were initialized
    around *θ*[1] = 0.25 and *θ*[2] = –1: notice again how the path quickly reaches
    *θ*[2] = 0, then rolls down the gutter and ends up bouncing around the global
    optimum (represented by the red square). If we increased *α*, the global optimum
    would move left along the dashed yellow line, while if we decreased *α*, the global
    optimum would move right (in this example, the optimal parameters for the unregularized

    In the bottom-right plot, the contours represent ridge regression’s cost function
    (i.e., an MSE cost function plus an ℓ[2] loss). As you can see, the gradients
    get smaller as the parameters approach the global optimum, so gradient descent
    naturally slows down. This limits the bouncing around, which helps ridge converge
    faster than lasso regression. Also note that the optimal parameters (represented
    by the red square) get closer and closer to the origin when you increase *α*,
    but they never get eliminated entirely.

    0, so the cost will be large if the model estimates a probability close to 0 for
    a positive instance, and it will also be large if the model estimates a probability
    close to 1 for a negative instance. On the other hand, –log(*t*) is close to 0
    when *t* is close to 1, so the cost will be close to 0 if the estimated probability

    (using Bayesian inference) that minimizing this loss will result in the model
    with the *maximum likelihood* of being optimal, assuming that the instances follow
    a Gaussian distribution around the mean of their class. When you use the log loss,
    this is the implicit assumption you are making. The more wrong this assumption
    is, the more biased the model will be. Similarly, when we used the MSE to train
    linear regression models, we were implicitly assuming that the data was purely
    linear, plus some Gaussian noise. So, if the data is not linear (e.g., if it’s
    quadratic) or if the noise is not Gaussian (e.g., if outliers are not exponentially
    rare), then the model will be biased.

    and for classification. You used a closed-form equation to solve linear regression,
    as well as gradient descent, and you learned how various penalties can be added
    to the cost function during training to regularize the model. Along the way, you
    also learned how to plot learning curves and analyze them, and how to implement
    early stopping. Finally, you learned how logistic regression and softmax regression
    work. We’ve opened up the first machine learning black boxes! In the next chapters
    we will open many more, starting with support vector machines.
