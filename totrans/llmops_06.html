<p>Open source tools give you more control but require you to do more work, while managed services are easier to set up and scale but often come at a higher cost. A popular repository of open source tools and data<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="HuggingFace" data-type="indexterm" id="id949"/> is HuggingFace, which contains a lot of pretrained models and tools to help with tasks like tokenization, fine-tuning, and data processing.</p>

<p>The business model you choose will impact your revenue, costs, and user experience and, thus, also your deployment decision. By understanding your users’ needs, evaluating your costs, and considering your competition, you can choose a business model that meets your needs and provides value to your users. Options include:</p>

<p>Most companies today are somewhere between using LLMs as IaaS or SaaS offerings via APIs, in which case the integration is pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>This chapter walks you through the deployment steps one by one and then offers tips on APIs, knowledge graphs, latency, and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="workflows" data-secondary="RAG" data-type="indexterm" id="id956"/>optimization.</p>

<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="ch06_quick_recommendations_1748919660052946">
<h1>Quick Recommendations</h1>

<p>If you’re building applications with complex workflows, like RAG applications, you may need more tools, like vector databases. Pinecone offers fast, low-latency vector search and managed services for production workflows. Weaviate is another powerful tool for semantic search, and Milvus or Qdrant are ideal for high-performance similarity searches at scale. Your application may require more structured data relationships; graph databases like Neo4j can model interactions and dependencies. Resource description framework (RDF) stores, such as Virtuoso or Blazegraph, can also be useful for advanced semantic reasoning.</p>

<p>LangChain <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LangChain" data-type="indexterm" id="id957"/>is a great option for preprocessing. It simplifies chaining prompts, adding memory, and creating agent-based systems. Haystack is another strong choice for document retrieval or question-answering pipelines. For integrating LLMs with external data sources, LlamaIndex works efficiently and with minimal effort.</p>

<p>Serving and optimizing models is another step in the LLMOps pipeline. Tools like Seldon and KServe let you deploy LLMs in Kubernetes<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="deployment tools" data-type="indexterm" id="id958"/> environments. They focus on scalability and ease of management. Both ZenML and MLflow help you track experiments and serve models seamlessly. When it comes to scaling distributed tasks during training or inference, Ray is highly effective.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you prefer minimal setup and can afford the cost, managed services are ideal. Google Cloud Vertex AI offers tools for training, tuning, and deploying LLMs. AWS SageMaker provides similar capabilities, with integrations like Data Wrangler for preprocessing. Snowflake Data Cloud is great for combining data storage, retrieval, and processing within ML workflows. Databricks is another strong contender, especially for fine-tuning and optimizing LLMs at scale. The Microsoft Azure platform is comprehensive, with offers that start at infrastructure, like GPU-based virtual machines (VMs), and end at pretrained models ready for deployment.</p>

<p>In this chapter, I will assume that you want to deploy your own models. While the principles of MLOps apply to some extent, LLMOps requires specific adjustments to handle the unique challenges of large-scale models.</p>

<p>Depending on the application, LLMOps workflows may involve pre- and postprocessing, chaining models, inference optimization, and integrating external systems like knowledge bases or APIs. Also, it requires handling large-scale text data, vectorized embeddings, and often RAG techniques for improving context in predictions.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how to do that using an example project. Let’s say you have a model you have already developed, called <code>my-llm-model</code>. The next step is to deploy it.</p>

<h1>Developing APIs for LLMs</h1>

<p>APIs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="deployment" data-secondary="APIs" data-type="indexterm" id="icd604"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="APIs (application programming interfaces)" data-type="indexterm" id="icd606"/> provide users a standardized way for clients to interact with their LLM and for developers to access and consume LLM services and models from a variety of sources. Following the best practices of LLMOps, as we’ll show you in this section, will help you make your APIs secure, reliable, easy to use, and ensure that they provide the functionality and performance that LLM-based applications need.</p>

<p>APIs have been around since the 1960s and 1970s. These early APIs were primarily used for system-level programming, allowing different components to communicate with each other within a single OS. With the rise of the internet in the 1990s, people began using APIs for web-based applications as well.</p>

<p>Web APIs <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="web APIs" data-type="indexterm" id="id977"/>allow different websites and web applications to communicate and exchange data with each other, based on two core rules of software development: high cohesion and loose coupling.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="high cohesion" data-type="indexterm" id="id978"/><em> High cohesion</em> means that the components of an API are closely related and focused on a single task. This makes the API easier to understand and maintain. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="loose coupling" data-type="indexterm" id="id979"/><em>Loose coupling</em> means that the components of an API are independent of each other, allowing them to change without affecting other parts. This increases flexibility and reduces dependencies.</p>

<p>Today, web APIs are an essential component of modern web-based applications, enabling developers to create powerful, integrated systems that can be accessed from anywhere at any time. Some common web APIs used by LLM-based applications include NLP APIs and LLMs-as-APIs.</p>

<p><em>NLP APIs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="NLP (natural language processing)" data-secondary=" APIs" data-type="indexterm" id="id980"/> </em>provide access to natural language processing functionalities such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named-entity recognition libraries. Tools include Hugging Face and spaCy.</p>

<p><em>LLMs-as-APIs </em>provide<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMs-as-APIs" data-seealso="APIs" data-type="indexterm" id="id981"/> access to LLMs and make predictions based on user prompts. They can be divided into two<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLM platform APIs" data-seealso="APIs" data-type="indexterm" id="id982"/> main categories. <em>LLM platform APIs</em> provide access to LLM platforms and services that enable developers to build, train, and deploy LLM models. Examples include Google Cloud LLM, Amazon SageMaker, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLM model APIs" data-seealso="APIs" data-type="indexterm" id="id983"/> <em>LLM model APIs</em> provide access to pretrained LLM models that can be used to make inferences on text, images, or speech. Model APIs are typically used for text generation, classification, and language translation. This category includes all the proprietary model APIs: OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, Ollama, and <span class="keep-together">so on.</span></p>

<p><em>Platform APIs</em> provide a range of services and tools for building, training, and deploying LLM models including end-to-end deployment tooling for data preparation, model training, model deployment, and model monitoring. LLM platform APIs’ most important benefit is that they allow developers to reuse existing LLM models and services, reducing the amount of time and effort required to build new applications. For example, Google Studio (with the Gemini family of models) is a suite of LLM services that enables developers to build, train, and deploy LLM models.</p>

<h2>API-Led Architecture Strategies</h2>

<p>An<em> API-led architecture strategy</em> is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="deployment" data-secondary="APIs" data-tertiary="API-led architecture strategies" data-type="indexterm" id="id984"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="APIs (application programming interfaces)" data-secondary="API-led architecture strategies" data-type="indexterm" id="id985"/> a design approach for deploying LLM-based applications using APIs to create complex, integrated systems that are scalable, flexible, and reusable; that can be accessed from anywhere, at any time; and that can handle large volumes of data and traffic. It involves using APIs to expose the functionality and data of different systems and services.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of web APIs: stateful and stateless. A<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="stateful web APIs" data-type="indexterm" id="id986"/> <em>stateful</em> API maintains and manages the state of a client or user session. The server keeps track of the state of the client or user and uses this information to provide personalized and context-aware responses based on the state of the client or user. This can improve the user experience by providing more relevant and useful information. A stateful API can also provide secure access and authentication to protect against unauthorized access and use. Examples of stateful APIs are shopping-cart APIs, user authentication APIs, content management APIs, and real-time communication APIs.</p>

<p><em>Stateless</em> <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="stateless web APIs" data-type="indexterm" id="id987"/>APIs do not store any information about previous requests. Each request is independent and contains all the necessary data to be processed. If one request fails, it doesn’t affect others because there’s no stored state. This means you can use stateless APIs across different environments or platforms without worrying about session <span class="keep-together">continuity.</span></p>

<p>Representational State Transfer (REST) is a type of web API that follows the RESTful architectural style. REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request contains all the information needed to complete the request. However, they can still maintain and manage the state of a client or user using techniques such as sessions, cookies, or tokens.</p>

<p>By using REST APIs, you can create scalable, flexible, and reusable systems that can handle large volumes of data and traffic. They can also provide the functionality and performance that modern web-based applications need.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Test the API</h2>

<p>Start the FastAPI server using <code>python app.py</code>. Once you have created your API, it’s important to manage it effectively to keep it secure, reliable, and performant. <em>API management </em>is a set of practices and tools for monitoring, maintaining, and improving your API. You should consider your API management approach before you even start developing your API. Good API management reduces the risk of security breaches and provides valuable insights into how your API is being used, and it makes the API a valuable asset that delivers value for your organization and users.</p>

<p>API management activities include monitoring performance, handling errors, implementing security measures, and regularly updating and maintaining the API. Managing the API for an LLM-based application involves several steps. The following list is high level and not all-inclusive:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Identify your application’s key functionalities and define the API endpoints you’ll use to access them. For example, you might have endpoints for generating text, retrieving model information, and/or managing user accounts.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Decide on the API design, such as whether to use a RESTful or GraphQL API, and what data format to use (for example, JSON). Make sure to follow best practices for API design, such as using meaningful endpoint names, providing clear and concise documentation, and using appropriate HTTP status codes.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Implement the API using a web framework (such as Flask or Django for Python or Express for Node.js). Make sure to handle errors gracefully, validate input data, and implement appropriate security measures, such as authentication and rate limiting.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Integrate the LLM into your API by creating a wrapper around the LLM library or API. This wrapper should handle input/output formatting, error handling, and any other necessary functionality.</p>

<h1>API Gateways</h1>

<p>An <em>API gateway </em>is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="deployment" data-secondary="APIs" data-tertiary="gateways" data-type="indexterm" id="id1002"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="APIs (application programming interfaces)" data-secondary="gateways" data-type="indexterm" id="id1003"/>a critical component of your LLM-based application. It provides a single entry point for all API requests and handles multiple services. It routes requests and handles load balancing, authentication, and sometimes caching or logging, acting as a middle layer between clients and microservices.</p> 

<p>To set up an API gateway for your LLM-based application:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Choose an API gateway provider that meets your needs in terms of features, scalability, and cost.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Define your API by specifying the endpoints, methods, and request/response formats. Make sure to use meaningful endpoint names and provide clear, concise documentation and appropriate HTTP status codes.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth or JWT, to ensure that only authorized users can access your API.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (such as denial-of-service, or DoS, attacks) and ensure fair use of your API. This might include setting a maximum number of requests per minute or hour or implementing more advanced rate-limiting algorithms. Monitor and log API activity to detect and respond to security threats, performance issues, or errors. This can include the implementation of logging and alerting mechanisms to notify you of any issues.</p>

<p>Setting up an API gateway for an LLM-based application has several advantages. It provides a single entry point for all API requests, making it easier to manage and monitor API traffic. This helps you identify and respond to security threats, performance issues, and errors faster. API gateways can handle authentication and authorization tasks, such as verifying API keys or tokens, and enforce access controls. They can also log and monitor API activity, providing valuable insights into how your LLM-based application is being used.

<p>To version your API, first include the version number in the API endpoint or request header. This makes it easy to identify which version of the API is being used. Then use semantic versioning to indicate the level of backward compatibility, which can help users understand the impact of changes and plan accordingly.</p>

<p>Make sure to document all changes between versions, including any breaking changes or deprecated features. This can help users understand how to migrate to the new version. You can include providing tools or scripts to help users update their code or configuration.</p>

<p>But it doesn’t stop at versioning. Your LLMOps strategy also needs to define your approach <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="deployment" data-secondary="APIs" data-tertiary="lifecycle management" data-type="indexterm" id="id1007"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="APIs (application programming interfaces)" data-secondary="lifecycle management" data-type="indexterm" id="id1008"/>to <em>API lifecycle management</em>, from design and development to deployment and retirement. The first step is to define the API lifecycle stages, such as planning, development, testing, deployment, and retirement. From there, the components you’ll need include:</p>

<dl>

	<dd>
	<p>A governance model establishes roles and responsibilities, defines processes and workflows, and determines which tools and technologies are acceptable.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Change management process</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Defining a change management process will help ensure that any future changes to the API are planned, tested, and communicated to users effectively.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="less_space pagebreak-before">
	<dt class="less_space">Monitoring and alerting</dt>

Modular designs are easier to update and scale, making them ideal for applications requiring flexibility. <em>Monolithic architectures</em> handle everything within a single framework. These models offer simplicity and tightly integrated workflows.</p>

<p>For modular systems, you’ll train components like retrievers, re-rankers, and generators independently. This approach allows you to focus on optimizing each module. It requires defining the communication between modules extremely well; most issues in modular systems happen when modules communicate incorrectly with one another. In contrast, monolithic architectures often involve end-to-end training, which simplifies dependencies but demands significant computational resources.</p>

<p>After training, save your model in a format that supports the architecture; for example, use open formats like ONNX for interoperability or native formats like PyTorch or TensorFlow for custom pipelines. Validation is crucial for both approaches. In terms of testing, modular systems require component-specific tests to ensure compatibility and performance, while monolithic architectures need comprehensive end-to-end evaluation to confirm their robustness.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Implementing a Microservices-Based Architecture"><div class="sect2" id="ch06_implementing_a_microservices_based_architecture_1748919660053945">
<h2>Implementing a Microservices-Based Architecture</h2>

<p>Let’s <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="microservices-based architectures" data-type="indexterm" id="icd610"/>say you’ve decided to adopt a <em>microservices-based architecture</em> for your LLM application. This is a modular architectural style that breaks a large application down into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Its benefits include improved scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.</p>

<p>In a microservice-based architecture, APIs serve as connectors between the different services. Each service exposes an API that allows other services to interact with it. APIs <em>decouple</em> the different services, allowing them to evolve independently. This means that changes to one service do not impact other services, reducing the risk of breaking changes.</p>

<p>APIs also enable services to scale independently, allowing you to allocate resources more efficiently. For example, you could scale your language translation service independently of your text-to-speech service. With APIs, you can build different services using different technologies and programming languages. This means that you can choose the best technology for each service, improving development speed and reducing technical debt.</p>

<p>To use different APIs as connectors for a microservice-based architecture for LLM applications:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Define clear and consistent APIs for each service, defining the input and output formats, authentication and authorization mechanisms, and error handling.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Implement standard API communication protocols, such as HTTP or gRPC, for compatibility and interoperability between services.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Implement security mechanisms, such as OAuth or JWT, to authenticate and authorize API requests.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to track API usage and detect issues. This can help you identify and resolve issues quickly and improve the user experience.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Implement versioning mechanisms to manage changes to the APIs and minimize their impact on existing applications and users.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach can help you build a scalable, flexible, and maintainable LLM application with multiple APIs that meets the needs of your users and enables distributed functionality for large-scale applications. Let’s look at how to implement your microservices architecture in more detail.</p>

As you’ve seen throughout this book, automation is critical to ensuring a system’s scalability and reliability. As we move through this section, you’ll get pointers about how using frameworks like <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LangChain" data-type="indexterm" id="id1021"/>LangChain and LlamaIndex can simplify this process.</p>

<p>Start with the <em>retriever</em>, which fetches relevant data based on a query. You can use dense vector embeddings and store them in a vector database, like Pinecone or Milvus. Once it retrieves results, the<em> re-ranker</em> reorders those results by relevance. LangChain provides modular components to integrate these steps seamlessly, allowing you to create pipelines to automate data retrieval and ranking with minimal intervention. LlamaIndex adds features for integrating retrieval systems with structured data sources, offering flexibility in managing knowledge sources.</p>

<p>Automation ensures that your retriever re-ranker pipeline is always up-to-date. This is especially useful when dealing with dynamic data, like user-generated content or frequently updated knowledge bases. Regular validation and retraining improve the accuracy of these pipelines over time.</p>

<p>Let’s look at an implementation that retrieves documents, re-ranks them, and feeds the most relevant context to an LLM (<a data-type="xref" href="#ch06_example_1_1748919660048653">Example 6-1</a>).</p>

They enable tasks like graph search, recommendation, and reasoning. To make sure your KG reflects the latest data, it’s wise to automate embedding creation and updates. That way, the pipelines can schedule updates whenever new data arrives, ensuring the KG stays accurate and ready for downstream applications. Libraries like PyTorch Geometric and DGL (Deep Graph Library) provide embedding generation tools. Regularly validate your pipelines to prevent errors from propagating through the graph.</p>

<p>The next example walks you through how to automate KG updates by building a pipeline using Python. The libraries used here are spaCy for entity linking and PyTorch Geometric and DGL for graph embeddings. For the KG itself, a Neo4j graph database is used.</p>

<p>First, install the libraries:</p>

<p>In step 3, the <code>link_entities_and_update_kg()</code> function uses spaCy to extract named entities from the input text.

The <code>MERGE</code> clause ensures that entities are created only if they don’t already exist in the graph.</p>

<p>In step 4, we use PyTorch Geometric to compute graph embeddings using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Nodes and edges are defined manually, and the GCNConv layer is applied to compute new embeddings.</p>

<p>At step 5, the <code>automate_kg_update()</code> function combines the two steps: it first links entities and updates the KG, and then it computes the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="graph embeddings" data-startref="icd605x" data-type="indexterm" id="id1029"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="embeddings" data-secondary="graph" data-startref="icd604x" data-type="indexterm" id="id1030"/>graph embeddings to keep the knowledge graph up-to-date with the latest entity information and structure.

<h1>Deployment Latency Optimization</h1>

<p>Reducing<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="deployment" data-secondary="latency optimization" data-type="indexterm" id="id1033"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="latency" data-secondary="deployment latency optimization" data-type="indexterm" id="id1034"/> latency is one of the most important considerations when deploying LLMs. Latency directly impacts performance and responsiveness. Some applications, such as chatbots, search engines, and real-time decision-making systems, require especially low latency, making it essential to find ways to minimize the time it takes for the system to return results.</p>

<p>One effective approach is to use<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Triton Inference Server" data-type="indexterm" id="jc6.1"/> Triton Inference Server, an open source platform designed specifically for high-performance model inference. It supports a wide variety of model types, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, and others. Triton significantly optimizes LLM execution, making it possible to handle multiple concurrent inference requests with minimal delay.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons for this. First, it supports model concurrency and can run models on GPUs. It can also dynamically load and unload models based on demand, which is useful for applications requiring low latency, such as chatbots, search engines, or real-time decision-making systems. Triton also supports <em>batching</em>, which allows it to combine multiple inference requests into a single operation, further improving throughput and reducing the overall response time.</p>

<p>To deploy an LLM using Triton Inference Server for optimized execution, first install Triton:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:latest </pre>

<p>Next, prepare the model directory. Make sure to save your model in a directory that Triton can access and in a format like TensorFlow SavedModel or PyTorch <span class="keep-together">TorchScript:</span></p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
model_repository/
├── my_model/
│   ├── 1/
│   │   └── model.pt</pre>

<p>Now run Triton from the terminal:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
docker run --gpus all --rm -p 8000:8000 -p 8001:8001 -p 8002:8002 \
  -v /path/to/model_repository:/models nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:latest \
  tritonserver --model-repository=/models</pre>

<p>Finally, query the server for inference. You can use a client library like <code>tritonclient</code> to send requests to the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Triton Inference Server" data-startref="jc6.1" data-type="indexterm" id="id1035"/> Triton server:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">

# Set up the Triton client
triton_client = tritonclient.grpc.InferenceServerClient(url="localhost:8001")

# Prepare the input data
input_data = some_input_data()

# Send inference request
response = triton_client.infer(model_name="my_model", inputs=[input_data])

<h1>Orchestrating Multiple Models</h1>

<p>To <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="deployment" data-secondary="orchestrating multiple models" data-type="indexterm" id="icd616"/>achieve efficiency and good response times in systems that require multiple models to work together, you’ll need to use<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="multi-model orchestration" data-type="indexterm" id="id1036"/> <em>multi-model orchestration,</em> which involves breaking models down into microservices. You’ll then deploy each model as an independent service, and they can interact through APIs or message queues. There are multiple ready-to-use orchestrators out there including Multi-Agent Orchestrator by AWS, and proxy tools like LiteLLM that allow you to switch between multiple models and APIs. But as with everything else in software, the higher the dependencies, the higher the debugging complexity when inferencing fails in mission-critical tasks.</p>

<p>For example, you might have separate models for different stages of processing: one for text preprocessing, another for text-to-speech, and another for generating responses. Orchestration can ensure that each part of the process happens concurrently and efficiently, reducing bottlenecks and speeding up the overall system.</p>

<p>You can use container <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="containerization" data-type="indexterm" id="icd601x"/>orchestration tools like <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="multi-model orchestration" data-type="indexterm" id="id1037"/>Kubernetes or <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Docker" data-secondary="managing multiple models" data-type="indexterm" id="icd606x"/>Docker Compose to manage multiple models running as microservices. Here’s how to create a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" class="less_space pagebreak-before">
version: '3'
services:
  model1:
    image: model1_image
    ports:
      - "5001:5001"
  model2:
    image: model2_image
    ports:
      - "5002:5002"
  model3:
    image: model3_image
    ports:
      - "5003:5003"</pre>

<p>Orchestrate the communication between the models using a message queue like RabbitMQ or through direct API calls. Each service listens for input and processes it sequentially or concurrently as needed.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to set up<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="load balancing" data-type="indexterm" id="id1038"/> <em>load balancing</em> to manage traffic between models and distribute requests efficiently. You’ll need to configure Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to run multiple instances of your models and balance the incoming traffic. Kubernetes uses a service to route requests to the appropriate pod, while Docker Swarm uses Docker’s built-in load balancer to automatically distribute traffic between containers. Let’s assume you have a Docker container running a model; for instance, a <code>model_image</code> Docker image. You want to deploy multiple instances of this model and use Kubernetes to load-balance the incoming requests.</p>

<p>First, create a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="deployment" data-type="indexterm" id="id1039"/>Kubernetes deployment configuration file, which will define the model container, and specify how many replicas of it you want:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: model-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3  # Number of instances to scale
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: model
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: model
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: model-container
          image: model_image:latest  # Your actual Docker image
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5000</pre>

<p class="pagebreak-before">This configuration will deploy three replicas. The Kubernetes Deployment will manage the <em>pods</em> running these models (the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes) and will automatically balance traffic. To distribute traffic among them, you need to expose them using a Kubernetes Service:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: model-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: model  # Match the app label from the deployment
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80  # External port
      targetPort: 5000  # Port the model container is listening to
  type: LoadBalancer</pre>

<p>This service will expose the three model replicas on port 80 and balance the traffic among them.</p>

<p>Now you can deploy the model and the service to your Kubernetes cluster:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
kubectl apply -f model-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f model-service.yaml
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services</pre>

<p>There are a few advantages to this level of modularity. For one thing, it allows you to scale each model independently, based on the demand for its specific task. For instance, if you have more requests for text generation than for entity recognition, you can scale up the text generation model without affecting the other models. Additionally, if one model fails, the other models can continue to operate, keeping the system available. That means you can swap out one model for a newer version or replace it with a different model to <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Docker" data-secondary="managing multiple models" data-startref="icd606x" data-type="indexterm" id="id1040"/>improve <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="deployment" data-secondary="orchestrating multiple models" data-startref="icd616" data-type="indexterm" id="id1041"/>performance.</p>

<h2>Asynchronous Querying</h2>

<p><em>Asynchronous querying</em> is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="asynchronous querying" data-type="indexterm" id="id1045"/> a powerful optimization technique that allows multiple queries to be processed concurrently, reducing the waiting time for each query. In traditional synchronous retrieval systems, each query is processed sequentially, but this causes delays when multiple requests are made at once. Asynchronous querying addresses this bottleneck by allowing the system to send queries to the vector store simultaneously and then wait for the responses in parallel.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of how you might implement asynchronous querying using Python:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
import asyncio
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Example function to retrieve vectors from FAISS
async def retrieve_from_faiss(query_vector, index):
    # Simulate a query to FAISS
    return index.search(np.array([query_vector]), k=5)

async def batch_retrieve(query_vectors, index):
    tasks = [
        retrieve_from_faiss(query_vector, index)
        for query_vector in query_vectors
    ]

    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results

# Initialize FAISS index
dimension = 128  # Example dimension
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)  # Use L2 distance for similarity search

# Create some random query vectors
query_vectors = np.random.rand(10, dimension).astype('float32')

# Perform asynchronous retrieval
results = asyncio.run(batch_retrieve(query_vectors, index))
print(results)</pre>

<p>In this example, <code>asyncio.gather()</code> sends all queries to Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) at once and waits for the responses asynchronously. This allows the system to process multiple queries in parallel, reducing the overall latency.</p>

Dense retrieval is particularly useful for capturing semantic relevance, while sparse retrieval excels at exact keyword matching. Combining both methods allows you to leverage the strengths of each for more accurate and comprehensive results. To do so, try the following code:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
from whoosh.index import create_in
from whoosh.fields import Schema, TEXT
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Initialize FAISS index for dense retrieval
dimension = 128
dense_index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)

# Simulate sparse retrieval with Whoosh
schema = Schema(content=TEXT(stored=True))
ix = create_in("index", schema)
writer = ix.writer()

writer.add_document(content="This is a test document.")
writer.add_document(content="Another document for retrieval.")
writer.commit()

# Query for dense and sparse retrieval
def retrieve_dense(query_vector):
    return dense_index.search(np.array([query_vector]), k=5)

def retrieve_sparse(query):
    searcher = ix.searcher()
    results = searcher.find("content", query)
    return [hit['content'] for hit in results]

query_vector = np.random.rand(1, dimension).astype('float32')
sparse_query = "document"

# Perform combined retrieval
dense_results = retrieve_dense(query_vector)
sparse_results = retrieve_sparse(sparse_query)

# Combine dense and sparse results
combined_results = dense_results + sparse_results
print("Combined results:", combined_results)</pre>

<p>In this example, FAISS handles dense vector-based retrieval, while Whoosh handles the sparse, keyword-based search. The results are then combined, offering both semantic and exact-match retrieval, which can improve the overall accuracy and completeness of the system’s responses.</p>

<h2>Key–Value Caching</h2>

<p><em>Key–value (KV) caching</em> works<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="KV (key–value) caching" data-type="indexterm" id="id1051"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="key–value (KV) caching" data-type="indexterm" id="id1052"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="caching" data-secondary="key–value" data-type="indexterm" id="id1053"/> similarly to embedding caching. It stores the results of key-value pairs, where the key is a query or an intermediate result and the value is the corresponding response or computed result. This allows the system to retrieve precomputed results instead of recalculating them each time it processes a repeated query. KV caching speeds up both the retrieval and generation, especially in large-scale, high-traffic systems.</p>

<p>In RAG systems, KV caching is typically applied during the retrieval phase to speed up the query–response cycle. In the generation phase, the model may use versions or parts of cached documents and responses to build its final output.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how to implement it in Python:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
import redis
import numpy as np
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Step 1. Initialize Redis client
r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Step 2. Initialize sentence transformer model
model = SentenceTransformer('paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Step 3. Function to get embeddings and cache them in Redis
def get_embeddings_from_cache_or_compute(query):
    cache_key = f"embedding:{query}"  # Key to store the query embeddings

    # Check if the embedding exists in the cache
    cached_embedding = r.get(cache_key)
   
    if cached_embedding:
        print("Cache hit, returning cached embedding")
        return np.frombuffer(cached_embedding, dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        print("Cache miss, computing and storing embedding")
        embedding = model.encode([query])
        r.set(cache_key, embedding.tobytes())  # Store embedding in Redis
        return embedding

# Step 4. Query the system
query = "What is the capital of France?"
embedding = get_embeddings_from_cache_or_compute(query)
print("Embedding:", embedding)</pre>

<p>In step 1, you connect to a Redis instance running locally to store the key-value pairs for quick lookup.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Then step 3 stipulates that when a query is received, the code checks if the embeddings <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="embeddings" data-secondary="KV caching" data-type="indexterm" id="id1054"/>for that query are already cached in Redis by checking the key (<code>embedding:&lt;query&gt;</code>). If the cache contains the embeddings (called a <em>cache hit</em>), it directly retrieves and returns them. If not (a<em> cache miss</em>), the embeddings are computed using <code>SentenceTransformer</code> and then stored. The embeddings are stored in Redis as bytes using <code>tobytes()</code> to ensure they can be retrieved in the same format.</p>

<p>By reducing the need to recompute embeddings or model responses, KV caching can help lower compute costs and reduce the strain on both the retrieval and generation components, ensuring that the system remains responsive even under heavy<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="deployment" data-secondary="RAG pipeline optimization" data-startref="icd617" data-type="indexterm" id="id1055"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)" data-secondary="pipeline optimization" data-startref="icd618" data-type="indexterm" id="id1056"/> load.</p>

In large-scale environments, the ability to scale your infrastructure efficiently is critical. <em>Distributed inference orchestration</em> allows the system to distribute the load across multiple nodes as traffic increases, with each handling a portion of the overall request. This reduces the chances of any single machine becoming overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Kubernetes <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="scaling" data-type="indexterm" id="id1061"/>is usually used to manage the scaling process by automating task distribution and adjusting resources as needed.</p>

<p>Reusable components make it easier to scale and manage your pipeline. They can be replicated across different services or projects quickly because they don’t require significant modifications. This is especially important in environments with constant updates and iterations. ZenML and similar orchestration tools allow you to create reusable pipelines, which you can modify or extend without disrupting the entire system. As you build new models or add new tasks, you can reuse existing components to maintain consistency and reduce development time.</p>

<p>Distributed inference orchestration and reusable components work hand in hand to ensure that your system is both scalable and maintainable. When traffic spikes or new use cases arise, it’s important to know that you can rely on your existing infrastructure to handle the demands. This makes the entire system more resilient and agile in adapting to new challenges.</p>

<p>Scalability and reusability are not just nice-to-haves but necessary features for high-traffic LLM systems. Distributed inference orchestration ensures that your system can scale to meet demand, while reusable components make it easier to maintain and expand the system over time. Together, they allow for efficient and effective handling of large-scale LLM deployments.</p>
