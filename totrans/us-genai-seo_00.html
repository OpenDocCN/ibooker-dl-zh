  <h1>Preface</h1>
  <p>OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked the start of a new technology revolution. This has driven a
    rapid demand for generative AI applications within organizations across the globe. With that explosion of
    demand came a whole host of ways to use generative AI that intersect with search engine optimization (SEO).</p>
  <p>In addition, major players, such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and Amazon, have all leapt into the AI space
    and are making huge investments in applying AI technology. Newcomers such as Anthropic and Perplexity have also made
    their mark. </p>
  <p>The purpose of this book is to provide a comprehensive education on what this technology is and how you can use it
    to drive your SEO program. Included are discussions of how you can use generative AI in your program today and how
    it will evolve and change in the future. Overall, our goal is to help you decide how you want to use generative AI and get
    your program into full gear. </p>
