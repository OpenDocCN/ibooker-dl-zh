    and manage information. But why limit agent memory to a single user’s interactions?
    Organizations and teams constantly build contextual stores of knowledge while
    executives, managers, and team leads struggle to effectively collect, store, and
    disseminate this information to those who need it.'

    knowledge beyond any individual’s tenure. With agents, the possibility emerges
    of a binding organizational memory that persists beyond any one person—dampening
    the impact of retirements, promotions, and role changes that naturally erase critical
    institutional insights. But how exactly can this process work, and what does this
    mean for the future of work?'

    Psychologists have a useful framework for this: transactive memory systems (TMSs).
    A *TMS* is defined as the “group-level knowledge sharing and memory system for
    encoding, storing, and retrieving information from different knowledge areas in
    a group.”^([1](ch05.html#id76)) In essence, it’s about “knowing what other team
    members know” and being able to access that knowledge when needed. This helps
    assemble the different pieces of distributed group knowledge into one coherent
    “group mind”—and this group mind is directly associated with team effectiveness.'

    are being developed to expand from one-on-one agent-human interactions to broader
    agent-human-team interactions with shared knowledge bases. The data stores are
    exactly the kind of TMSs that hold the potential to improve team effectiveness
    ([Figure 5-1](#ch05_figure_1_1758256568086742)). Indeed, there’s convincing evidence
    that such centralized systems of knowledge benefit not only existing team members
    but newly onboarded and novice employees as well. In a recent 2023 call center
    study, AI assistants deployed to support customer interactions demonstrated this
    effect dramatically: novice workers improved their productivity by 34% while experienced
    workers saw minimal gains, suggesting that the AI effectively captured and disseminated
    the expertise of top performers throughout the organization.^([2](ch05.html#id77))'

    memory systems through servers like the Knowledge Graph Memory Server, which maintains
    entities, relationships, and observations across conversations. Unlike traditional
    platforms, MCP creates a decentralized approach where multiple lightweight servers
    can expose specific capabilities—from local files to remote APIs—while maintaining
    a unified interface for AI agents. This architecture allows teams to construct
    custom knowledge graphs that evolve with each interaction, storing not just information
    but also the relationships and context between different pieces of organizational
    knowledge.^([3](ch05.html#id78))

    a single human and an AI agent. By now, it should be clear that’s only one piece
    of a much larger system. As more employees interact with organizational agents,
    these systems capture and store increasing amounts of context. This stored context
    then becomes accessible to other team members, transforming previously tacit knowledge
    into shared resources that boost productivity across the organization. We’re witnessing
    the beginning of a powerful feedback loop: the more people use these systems,
    the smarter and more valuable the systems become. As organizations adopt enterprise-level
    knowledge stores, this dynamic will only accelerate. The companies that thrive
    will be those that successfully transform their AI agents from mere tools into
    collaborative team members, their static data into living knowledge, and their
    individual expertise into collective intelligence.'
