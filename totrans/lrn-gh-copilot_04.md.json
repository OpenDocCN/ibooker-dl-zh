["```py\nHow does this code work?\n```", "```py\nThis code defines a function `is_prime(n)` that checks whether a \ngiven integer `n` is a prime number. Here's how it works:\n\n### 1\\. **Check if `n` is less than or equal to 1**\n```", "```py\n- Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime, so the function \nimmediately returns `False`.\n\n### 2\\. **Iterate through potential divisors**\n```", "```py\n- The function loops through integers `i` starting from 2 up to the \nsquare root of `n` (inclusive). The square root is calculated using \n`n**0.5`, and `int(n**0.5) + 1` ensures the range includes the \ninteger part of the square root.\n- If `n` is divisible by any `i` in this range (`n % i == 0`), it is\n not a prime number, and the function returns `False`.\n\n### 3\\. **Return `True` if no divisors are found**\n```", "```py\n- If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function \nconcludes that `n` is a prime number and returns `True`.\n\n### **Key Points**\n- **Optimization**: The loop only checks divisors up to the square\n root of `n`, which reduces the number of iterations compared to\nchecking all numbers up to `n-1`.\n- **Prime Definition**: A prime number is greater than 1 and\n divisible only by 1 and itself. This function implements that\n definition efficiently.\n\n### Example\n- Input: `is_prime(7)`\n  - The loop checks divisors 2 and 3 (since `int(7**0.5) + 1 = 3`).\n  - Since 7 is not divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns `True`.\n- Input: `is_prime(9)`\n  - The loop checks divisors 2 and 3.\n  - Since 9 is divisible by 3, the function returns `False`.\n```", "```py\nHow does this code work?\n```", "```py\ndocument the selected code\n```", "```py\n@vscode how do I debug\n```", "```py\n\"github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions\": [\n    {\n        \"text\": \"Always add comments to generated code describing \nits purpose.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"text\": \"Use underscores for private field names in\n TypeScript.\"\n     }\n]\n```", "```py\n# Custom Instructions for Code Generation\n\n- Always add comments to generated code describing its purpose.\n- Use underscores for private field names in TypeScript.\n```", "```py\n \"github.copilot.chat.reviewSelection.instructions\": [\n    {\n       \"file\": \".docs/code-style.md\"\n    }\n ]\n```"]
