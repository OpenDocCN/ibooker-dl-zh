    you might use to evaluate your applications and how these criteria are defined
    and calculated. For example, many people worry about AI making up facts—how is
    factual consistency detected? How are domain-specific capabilities like math,
    science, reasoning, and summarization measured?

    quite common. This happens not only because the application is hard to evaluate
    but also because application developers don’t have visibility into how their applications
    are being used. An ML engineer at a used car dealership told me that his team
    built a model to predict the value of a car based on the specs given by the owner.
    A year after the model was deployed, their users seemed to like the feature, but
    he had no idea if the model’s predictions were accurate. At the beginning of the
    ChatGPT fever, companies rushed to deploy customer support chatbots. Many of them
    are still unsure if these chatbots help or hurt their user experience.

    *evaluation-driven development*. The name is inspired by [*test-driven development*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
    in software engineering, which refers to the method of writing tests before writing
    code. In AI engineering, evaluation-driven development means defining evaluation
    criteria before building.

    to translate from Latin to English, you need a model that understands both Latin
    and English. Coding and English–Latin understanding are domain-specific capabilities.
    A model’s domain-specific capabilities are constrained by its configuration (such
    as model architecture and size) and training data. If a model never saw Latin
    during its training process, it won’t be able to understand Latin. Models that
    don’t have the capabilities your application requires won’t work for you.

    Coding-related capabilities are typically evaluated using functional correctness,
    as discussed in [Chapter 3](ch03.html#ch03a_evaluation_methodology_1730150757064067).
    While functional correctness is important, it might not be the only aspect that
    you care about. You might also care about efficiency and cost. For example, would
    you want a car that runs but consumes an excessive amount of fuel? Similarly,
    if an SQL query generated by your text-to-SQL model is correct but takes too long
    or requires too much memory to run, it might not be usable.

    (Li et al., 2023) is an example of a benchmark that takes into account not only
    the generated query’s execution accuracy but also its efficiency, which is measured
    by comparing the runtime of the generated query with the runtime of the ground
    truth SQL query.

    can understand it, it will be challenging to maintain the code or incorporate

    so you might have to rely on subjective evaluation, such as using AI judges.

- en: Non-coding domain capabilities are often evaluated with close-ended tasks, such
    as multiple-choice questions. Close-ended outputs are easier to verify and reproduce.
    For example, if you want to evaluate a model’s ability to do math, an open-ended
    approach is to ask the model to generate the solution to a given problem. A close-ended
    approach is to give the model several options and let it pick the correct one.
    If the expected answer is option C and the model outputs option A, the model is
    wrong.

    metric is accuracy—how many questions the model gets right. Some tasks use a point
    system to grade a model’s performance—harder questions are worth more points.

    gets one point for each option it gets right.

    extra space between the question and answer or an addition of an additional instructional
    phrase, such as “Choices:” can cause the model to change its answers. Models’

    good way to evaluate foundation models. MCQs test the ability to differentiate
    good responses from bad responses (classification), which is different from the
    ability to generate good responses. MCQs are best suited for evaluating knowledge
    (“does the model know that Paris is the capital of France?”) and reasoning (“can
    the model infer from a table of business expenses which department is spending
    the most?”). They aren’t ideal for evaluating generation capabilities such as

    a thing. For decades, the brightest minds in NLP (natural language processing)
    have been working on how to evaluate the quality of open-ended outputs. The subfield

    NLG tasks in the early 2010s included translation, summarization, and paraphrasing.

    *fluency* and *coherence*. Fluency measures whether the text is grammatically
    correct and natural-sounding (does this sound like something written by a fluent
    speaker?). Coherence measures how well-structured the whole text is (does it follow
    a logical structure?). Each task might also have its own metrics. For example,
    a metric a translation task might use is *faithfulness*: how faithful is the generated
    translation to the original sentence? A metric that a summarization task might
    use is *relevance*: does the summary focus on the most important aspects of the
    source document? ([Li et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05227)).'

- en: Some early NLG metrics, including *faithfulness* and *relevance*, have been
    repurposed, with significant modifications, to evaluate the outputs of foundation
    models. As generative models improved, many issues of early NLG systems went away,
    and the metrics used to track these issues became less important. In the 2010s,
    generated texts didn’t sound natural. They were typically full of grammatical
    errors and awkward sentences. Fluency and coherence, then, were important metrics
    to track. However, as language models’ generation capabilities have improved,
    AI-generated texts have become nearly indistinguishable from human-generated texts.
    Fluency and coherence become less important.^([2](ch04.html#id1001)) However,
    these metrics can still be useful for weaker models or for applications involving
    creative writing and low-resource languages. Fluency and coherence can be evaluated
    using AI as a judge—asking an AI model how fluent and coherent a text is—or using
    perplexity, as discussed in [Chapter 3](ch03.html#ch03a_evaluation_methodology_1730150757064067).

    If you decide to do finetuning, you might start with a small model to test your
    code and move toward the biggest model that fits your hardware constraints (e.g.,

    toxicity, or factual consistency. When estimating how much you can improve on
    a certain attribute, it can be tricky to balance being optimistic and being realistic.
    I’ve had situations where a model’s accuracy hovered around 20% for the first
    few prompts. However, the accuracy jumped to 70% after I decomposed the task into
    two steps. At the same time, I’ve had situations where a model remained unusable
    for my task even after weeks of tweaking, and I had to give up on that model.

    that since a model’s performance is largely a function of what data it was trained

    foundation models, the open source world was confusing enough, with so many different
    licenses, such as MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Apache 2.0, GNU
    General Public License (GPL), BSD (Berkely Software Distribution), Creative Commons,
    etc. Open source models made the licensing situation worse. Many models are released
    under their own unique licenses. For example, Meta released Llama 2 under the
    [Llama 2 Community License Agreement](https://oreil.ly/wRlEh) and Llama 3 under
    the [Llama 3 Community License Agreement](https://oreil.ly/FL-1Z). Hugging Face
    released their model BigCode under the [BigCode Open RAIL-M v1](https://oreil.ly/yED-R)
    license. However, I hope that, over time, the community will converge toward some
    standard licenses. Both [Google’s Gemma](https://github.com/google-deepmind/gemma/blob/main/LICENSE)

    be available through different APIs with different features, constraints, and

    if you’ve built your system around it. You can’t freeze a commercial model the
    way you can with open source models. Historically, commercial models lack transparency
    in model changes, versions, and roadmaps. Models are frequently updated, but not
    all changes are announced in advance or even announced at all. Your prompts might
    stop working as expected and you have no idea. Unpredictable changes also make
    commercial models unusable for strictly regulated applications. However, I suspect
    that this historical lack of transparency in model changes might just be an unintentional
    side effect of a fast-growing industry. I hope that this will change as the industry

    data from publicly available benchmarks. Benchmark data published before the training
    of a model is likely included in the model’s training data.^([27](ch04.html#id1097))

    data come from the same source. For example, you might include math textbooks

    the model’s capabilities.

    you want to create the best possible model for your users. Initially, you exclude
    benchmark data from the model’s training data and choose the best model based
    on these benchmarks. However, because high-quality benchmark data can improve
    the model’s performance, you then continue training your best model on benchmark
    data before releasing it to your users. So the released model is contaminated,
    and your users won’t be able to evaluate it on contaminated benchmarks, but this

    logprobs for these three classes are all between 30 and 40%, this means the model
    isn’t confident about this prediction. However, if the model’s probability for
    one class is 95%, this means that the model is highly confident about this prediction.

    Star metric to guide their application development. Each day, you can use human
    experts to evaluate a subset of your application’s outputs that day to detect
    any changes in the application’s performance or unusual patterns in usage. For

    evolve, and you’ll need to iterate on your evaluation pipeline. You might need
    to update the evaluation criteria, change the scoring rubric, and add or remove
    examples. While iteration is necessary, you should be able to expect a certain
    level of consistency from your evaluation pipeline. If the evaluation process
    changes constantly, you won’t be able to use the evaluation results to guide your
    application’s development.

    application developers, the challenge is no longer in developing models but in
    selecting the right models for your application. This chapter discussed a list
    of criteria that are often used to evaluate models for applications, and how they
    are evaluated. It discussed how to evaluate both domain-specific capabilities
    and generation capabilities, including factual consistency and safety. Many criteria
    to evaluate foundation models evolved from traditional NLP, including fluency,
    coherence, and faithfulness.

    benchmarks can help you weed out bad models, but they won’t help you find the
    best models for your applications. Public benchmarks are also likely contaminated,
    as their data is included in the training data of many models. There are public
    leaderboards that aggregate multiple benchmarks to rank models, but how benchmarks
    are selected and aggregated is not a clear process. The lessons learned from public
    leaderboards are helpful for model selection, as model selection is akin to creating
    a private leaderboard to rank models based on your needs.

    why invest millions, if not billions, into building models just for others to

    their competitors (Google, Microsoft/OpenAI) in check. Both Mistral and Cohere
    have open source models, but they also have APIs. At some point, inference services
    on top of Mistral and Cohere models become their competitors.There’s the argument
