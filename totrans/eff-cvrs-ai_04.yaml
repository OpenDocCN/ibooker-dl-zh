- en: T*he chatbot doesn’t understand me* is the most common pain point users have
    when interacting with conversational AI. For traditional chatbots, this is caused
    by a poorly trained classifier; for other chatbots, it could be from having a
    bad search mechanism or simply not having access to the right information.

- en: No matter what kind of chatbot you are building, the core capability you need
    is to understand what the user is asking for and respond appropriately. Chatbots
    that understand requests give useful responses; those that don’t understand say
    something like “I’m sorry, I didn’t understand—would you mind rephrasing?”

- en: There are multiple methods for addressing poor understanding, and all of them
    hinge on identifying what your users want to accomplish and how they phrase their
    requests. Chapter 4 focuses on how to extract this data from logs and other sources.
    Chapter 5 shows how to improve chatbot understanding through training classifiers,
    and chapter 6 adds generative AI to the runtime mix with retrieval augmented generation
    (RAG). Chapter 7 uses generative AI at train and test time by creating new training
    and testing data with LLMs.
