<ul class="calibre24">
<li class="readable-text1" id="p2">Setting up Python, Visual Studio Code, and Copilot on your system</li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p3">Introducing the Copilot design process </li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p5">
<p class="calibre15">We want you to be able to create software yourself right from the start. To do this, we’ll guide you through setting up Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, and Copilot on your machine and familiarize you with how to interact with these tools. After you’ve set up the tools, you’ll be able to follow along with our examples and start creating software yourself. There’s no substitute for practice, and we believe you can learn right alongside us for the remainder of the book. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p6">
<p class="calibre15">Once you’ve set up Copilot, we’ll walk through a fun example that showcases the power of Copilot in solving standard tasks. You’ll see how to interact with Copilot, and you’ll learn how you can write software without writing any actual code. Keep in mind that Copilot isn’t perfect, and you need to be able to read and understand a little Python to get what you want, but it gives you a big head start. Let’s get started creating your first computer program. </p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p7">
<h2 class="readable-text-h1" id="sigil_toc_id_25"><span class="calibre22">2.1</span> Setting up your computer to start learning</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p8">
<p class="calibre15">Learning how to write software requires that you go beyond just reading about it and actually perform the task of writing software. If this were a book on how to play guitar, would you keep reading it without ever trying to play the guitar? We thought not. Reading this book without following along and trying it out yourself would be like watching a marathon runner finish the race and thinking you’re ready to go run one yourself. We’ll stop with the analogies, but seriously, you need to get your software installed and running before we go farther.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p9">
<p class="calibre15">What scares us the most right now is that we just hit the most common point where novices, even those eager to learn programming, tend to fail, and we <em class="calibre18">really</em> want to see you succeed. Now, you might be thinking, “Wait, really? We’re just getting started.” Yes, that’s exactly the point. In Leo’s popular Coursera course about learning Java programming [1], can you guess the point when most new learners leave? Is it the challenging assignment at the end of the course that involves plotting earthquake markers on the globe in real time? No. It’s actually the warmup assignment where learners must set up their programming environment. As such, we understand this could be a hurdle for you. We hope that with this not-so-subtle nudge, we can help you achieve all the goals you had in mind when you bought this book. It all starts with installing the software.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p10">
<h2 class="readable-text-h1" id="sigil_toc_id_26"><span class="calibre22">2.2</span> The software we’ll be using</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p11">
<p class="calibre15">To set up and use Copilot easily, we’ll install the software editing tools used by novices and software engineers alike. The tools you’ll use are Python, VS Code, GitHub, and Copilot. Of course, if you already have all of these tools installed, jump to section 2.6.1.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p12">
<h3 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_27"><span class="calibre22">2.2.1</span> Python</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p13">
<p class="calibre15">Any programming language would have worked for this book, but we picked Python because it’s one of the most popular programming languages in the world and is the language we teach in our introductory courses at our universities. As we said in chapter 1, compared to other languages, Python is easier to read, easier to understand, and easier to write. For this book, Copilot will primarily generate the code, not you. However, you’ll want to read and understand the code generated by Copilot, and Python is great for that.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p14">
<h3 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_28"><span class="calibre22">2.2.2</span> Visual Studio Code</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p15">
<p class="calibre15">You can use any text editor to program. However, if you want a nice programming environment where you can write code, easily get suggestions from Copilot, and run your code, VS Code is our preferred tool. VS Code is used by novices learning software and is well liked by students [2]. It’s also used globally by professional software engineers, which means you can work and learn while using this environment after finishing the book. For VS Code to work for this book, you’ll need to install a few extensions that enable working with Python and using Copilot, but one of the great things about VS Code is that it’s easy to install those extensions.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p16">
<h3 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_29"><span class="calibre22">2.2.3</span> GitHub account</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p17">
<p class="calibre15">GitHub is an industry-standard tool for developing, maintaining, and storing software. We won’t use GitHub in this book, however. We’re signing up for GitHub simply because you’ll need an account to access Copilot. Signing up for a GitHub account is free, but, at the time of writing, they charge for Copilot. If you’re a student, they will waive that fee. If you aren’t a student, as of writing, you can get a 30-day free trial. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p18">
<p class="calibre15">You might ask why they charge for the service, and there’s a good answer. It’s expensive to build the GPT models (imagine thousands of computers running for a year to build the model), and GitHub incurs costs by providing predictions from the model (many machines are receiving your input, running it through the model, and generating your output). If you’re not ready to commit to using Copilot, you could make a calendar note for roughly 25 days from the day you sign up, and if you aren’t using Copilot at that time, just cancel. If, on the other hand, you’ve succeeded in learning how to write software with Copilot and are using it to improve your productivity at work or as a hobby, it may make sense to keep it.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p19">
<p class="calibre15">Over the course of this chapter, we’ll install all of these tools, but we’re going to do this in two parts. The first part, coming up next, will get you set up to write and run code on your own so you become familiar with that process. The second part will set you up to use Copilot to assist you in the process of writing code.</p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p21">
<p class="calibre15">In this first part of our installation guide, we’ll install Python and VS Code. To streamline this section, we’re just outlining the main steps that you should follow. However, there are more detailed instructions available in the following locations:</p>
</div>
<ul class="calibre24">
<li class="readable-text1" id="p22"> VS Code maintains a tutorial for getting started writing code in Python at <a href="https://mng.bz/znjQ">https://mng.bz/znjQ</a>. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p23"> The website for this book (<a href="https://mng.bz/0M46">https://mng.bz/0M46</a>) provides detailed instructions for setting up both PC and macOS systems. Because the websites for these tools might change after we write this book, we encourage you to use a combination of the GitHub link and the book website together. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p24"> In the online book forum (<a href="https://mng.bz/NBK1">https://mng.bz/NBK1</a>), you can ask for help and see the answers to a list of frequently asked questions. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p25">
<p class="calibre15">The primary steps you’ll need to accomplish are as follows:</p>
</div>
<ol class="calibre28">
<li class="readable-text1" id="p26"> Install Python: 
    <ul class="calibre29">
<li class="calibre30"> Go to <a href="http://www.python.org/downloads/">www.python.org/downloads/</a>. </li>
<li class="calibre30"> Download and install the latest version of Python (3.12.3 at the time of writing). </li>
</ul></li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p27"> Install VS Code: 
    <ul class="calibre29">
<li class="calibre30"> Go to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">https://code.visualstudio.com/download</a>, and select the main download for your operating system (e.g., Windows or Mac). </li>
<li class="calibre30"> Download and install the latest version of VS Code. </li>
</ul></li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p28"> Install a VS Code Extension: (for details, see <a href="https://mng.bz/9o01">https://mng.bz/9o01</a>). 
    <ul class="calibre29">
<li class="calibre30"> <em class="calibre18">Python (by Microsoft)</em>—Follow the instructions at <a href="https://mng.bz/j0gP">https://mng.bz/j0gP</a> to set up the Python extension correctly (specifically, selecting the correct interpreter). </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<div class="readable-text" id="p29">
<p class="calibre15">Although the instructions here are brief, we know in reality they can take some time. If you encounter any problems, consult the resources mentioned earlier for more detailed setup instructions. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p30">
<h2 class="readable-text-h1" id="sigil_toc_id_31"><span class="calibre22">2.4</span> Working with Python in Visual Studio Code</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p31">
<p class="calibre15">Now that your system is set up, let’s get acquainted with the VS Code interface shown in figure 2.1. (You may need to click the Explorer icon in the middle/top left to get this same view.) The following regions are identified in figure 2.1:</p>
</div>
<ul class="calibre24">
<li class="readable-text1" id="p32"> <em class="calibre18">Activity Bar —</em>On the far left is the Activity Bar where we can open file folders (also known as directories) or install extensions (as you did to install the Python extension in the previous section). </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p33"> <em class="calibre18">Side Bar —</em>The Side Bar shows what is presently open in the Activity Bar. In figure 2.1, the Activity Bar shows the Explorer selected, so the Side Bar is showing the files in the current folder. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p34"> <em class="calibre18">Editor Pane(s) —</em>These are the primary areas we’ll use to create our software. The editor in the Editor Pane is similar to any other text editor in that you can write, edit, copy, and paste text using the clipboard. The editor is special, however, because it’s designed to work well with code. At this point, we’ll be writing code in this window, but later in this chapter, you’ll primarily work in this window by asking Copilot to generate code, and then you’ll test that code. <span/> </li>
</ul>

<h5 class="figure-container-h"><span>Figure 2.1</span> The VS Code interface [3]</h5>
</div>
<ul class="calibre24">
<li class="readable-text1" id="p36"> <em class="calibre18">Output and Terminal Panel —</em>In this area of the interface, you’ll see the output of your code or any errors that have occurred in the following tabs: Problems, Output, Debug Console, and Terminal. We’ll primarily use the Problems tab, where we can see potential errors in our code, and the Terminal tab, which allows us to interact with Python and see the output of our code. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p37">
<p class="calibre15">VS Code has many different color schemes, so you can use any color scheme you like as the functionality is the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p38">
<h3 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_32"><span class="calibre22">2.4.1</span> Set up your working folder</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p39">
<p class="calibre15">In the top of the Activity Bar on the left in VS Code, you’ll find Explorer as the top icon. After you click Explorer, you should see a No Folder Open message. Click the button to open a folder, and select a folder on your computer (or make a new one—we like the folder name fun_with_Copilot). Once you’ve opened this folder, your workspace will be the folder you opened, which means you should have your code and any data files, like the one we’ll use later in this chapter, in that folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="callout-container">
<div class="readable-text" id="p40">
<h5 class="callout-container-h">File not found or file missing errors </h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p41">
<p class="calibre15">If you ever receive an error that says you’re missing a file, take heart: these are the kinds of errors that everyone makes. They can be really annoying when writing software. Perhaps you just didn’t put the file in your working folder—this happens—but it’s an easy fix by copying or moving the file into the correct folder. However, sometimes, you’ll see the file in the folder, but when you run your code in VS Code, Python can’t seem to find it. If this happens to you (it happened to us when writing the book!), be sure to have the folder with the code and the desired file open using Explorer in VS Code (as shown in the Side Bar in figure 2.1).</p>

<h3 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_33"><span class="calibre22">2.4.2</span> Check to see if your setup is working properly</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p43">
<p class="calibre15">Let’s check to see if we’ve set up everything properly. To do this, we start by creating a new file to hold our program. You do this by going to File &gt; New File (figure 2.2), and then selecting Python File (figure 2.3).<span/></p>

<h5 class="figure-container-h"><span>Figure 2.2</span> How to create a new file in VS Code</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p45">
<p class="calibre15">After creating the file, we like to make sure we’ve saved the file. Go to File &gt; Save As, and name this file first_program.py. Next, in the text editor, type the following exactly as it appears here:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p46">
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area">print("Hello World")<strong class="calibre17"> </strong></pre>

<div class="readable-text" id="p47">
<p class="calibre15">You might already be guessing what will happen when we run this program. It should print “Hello World” to the screen. Let’s run it and see! First, you’ll want to save your file by going to File &gt; Save. <span/></p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p50">
<p class="calibre15">To run your program, go to the top-right corner of the text editor, and click the Run Code icon, as shown earlier in figure 2.1. After clicking the icon, in the Terminal section at the bottom, you should see something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p51">
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area">&gt; &amp; C:/Users/&lt;YOUR_NAME&gt;/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312/python.exe 
<span>↪</span> c:/Users/&lt;YOUR_NAME&gt;/Copilot/first_program.py
Hello World</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p52">
<p class="calibre15">The top line starting with &gt; is the command for the computer to run your code, and all it says is to run your first_program.py using Python. The second line is the output from running the command, and it says, “Hello World,” which is what we’d hoped to see. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p53">
<p class="calibre15">Congratulations! You’ve written your first program! We now know that your programming environment is set up correctly. Let’s get started with writing just a couple more small pieces of code to get familiar with this workflow, and then we’ll move on to the workflow with Copilot.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p54">
<h2 class="readable-text-h1" id="sigil_toc_id_34"><span class="calibre22">2.5</span> Writing and running some small programs</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p55">
<p class="calibre15">You’ve just finished the major step of installing Python and VS Code and getting it working. Before we start working with our AI assistant, Copilot, let’s write a few more small programs so you get a feel for typing and running code.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p56">
<p class="calibre15">Let’s start with writing a small program that involves adding numbers. Go ahead and delete the line you wrote that prints Hello World, and replace it with the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p57">
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area">a = 10
b = 20
print(a + b)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p58">
<p class="calibre15">What do you think that code will print? Will it print “a + b”, or will it print 30? Go ahead and run it and see.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p59">
<p class="calibre15">The computer calculated the sum of 10 and 20 and printed 30. This is pretty neat, right? We’ve used the computer to do some small calculations. If you change the value for <code class="calibre25">a</code> or <code class="calibre25">b</code>, what do you think will happen? Feel free to play with this on your own.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p60">
<p class="calibre15">We’ll spend a lot more time later in this book talking about the details of how to read code, but if you’re curious, here’s how to read that code:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p61">
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area">a = 10    <span/> #1
b = 20          <span/> #2
print(a + b)  <span/> #3</pre>
<div class="code-annotations-overlay-container">
     #1 Creates a variable named “a” and gives it the value 10
     <br class="calibre1"/>#2 Creates a variable named “b” and gives it the value 20
     <br class="calibre1"/>#3 Adds “a” and “b” and then prints the result to the screen
     <br class="calibre1"/>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p62">
<p class="calibre15">The key piece right now is that you become comfortable with the idea of typing code in the Editor Pane and running it using the Run button. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p63">
<p class="calibre15">Let’s do just one more small example. Suppose you want to calculate the area of a square. Recalling our formulas for shapes, the area of a square whose sides are length <em class="calibre18">s</em> is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p64">
<p class="calibre15">Area = <em class="calibre18">s </em><sup class="calibre34">2</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p65">
<p class="calibre15">Let’s start with defining a side to be a certain length and then printing the area:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p66">
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area">side = 5
area = side * side
print("Side length:", side, " Square area is:", area)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p67">
<p class="calibre15">We encourage you to type and run that code. When you run it, you should get the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p68">
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area">Side length: 5 Square area is: 25</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p69">
<p class="calibre15">Did you run into any problems typing in that code? We suspect many of you did. If you missed a quotation mark, a comma, or a parenthesis, you probably got some kind of unpleasant error like this (here, if you forgot a comma) when you ran the code:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p70">
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area">File "c:\Users\Leo\Copilot\first_program.py", line 7
    print("Side length:" side, " Square area is:", area)
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p71">
<p class="calibre15">In the old way of learning programming, you’d spend a lot of time making sure you understood the exact characters to write to make the programming language, Python, happy. We’ll reiterate the good news: with an AI assistant like Copilot, syntax becomes much, much less important. Let’s get Copilot installed so you can learn how to work with that tool.</p>

<p class="calibre15">The prompts and code we write will be in bold font to help distinguish between what we write, and the code and comments Copilot may give us. The # sign at the start is important (and you should include it in what you typed). It means that what you wrote is a comment (depending on your VS Code color palette, it may be a different color than the code we’re about to produce). Comments are <em class="calibre18">not</em> code: the computer executes code and doesn’t execute comments. Comments are used by programmers to provide a human-readable summary of what the code did to help other software engineers read the code. Today, its purpose has expanded to also prompt Copilot. After writing a comment (and sometimes even while writing comments), Copilot will attempt to give us suggestions. You can think of this as a much more sophisticated autocomplete, like when you type “New York T” in your search engine, and it autocompletes with “New York Times.”</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p87">
<p class="calibre15">To trigger Copilot to start giving us code (or more comments), press Enter at the end of the line, and you’ll be at the start of a new line. Pause for a moment, and you should see something appear. Until accepted, Copilot’s suggestions are in light gray italics. If you don’t get a suggestion yet, you may need to press Enter a second time to trigger Copilot to suggest the code. Here’s what happened for us:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p89">
<p class="calibre15">If you still don’t see a suggestion from Copilot, try pressing Ctrl-Enter (hold Ctrl while pressing Enter). When you press Ctrl-Enter, a new window will appear to the right of your editor window with the program called GitHub Copilot Suggestions. If that window doesn’t appear, there may be something wrong with your setup, and we encourage you to go to the book website to double-check that you followed all the steps correctly or to find (or ask for) help.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p90">
<p class="calibre15">If you saw the suggestion from Copilot, press Tab to accept Copilot’s suggestion. Once you do this, the suggestion that was previously in light gray italics should now be in a standard font:</p>

<p class="calibre15">If you’re seeing different code than this, it’s because of something we mentioned earlier: Copilot is nondeterministic so you may see different code than we do.

<p class="calibre15">You might think this slight difference (no parentheses around <code class="calibre25">"Hello</code> <code class="calibre25">Copilot"</code>) wouldn’t matter, but it does. Before Python 3, this was the correct syntax for a print statement, and when Python 3 was introduced, it switched to the code with parentheses. Because we’re running Python 3, you need to have the parentheses for the code to work. You might ask why Copilot gets this wrong. The problem is Copilot was trained on some old Python code as part of its training. If this seems annoying, we agree. But it’s another hint of the frustration novice programmers went through before Copilot. Most of what Copilot suggests is syntactically correct. But if you’re a novice writing the code from scratch, missing parentheses or a missing colon somewhere might cost you a lot of time. Now we have the correct code as</p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p118">
<p class="calibre15">We want to start with some data processing as this is something that many of you have likely done in your personal or professional lives. To find a dataset, we went to a great website called Kaggle [4], which has tons of datasets freely available for use. Many of them include important data such as health statistics for different countries, information to help track the spread of disease, and so on. We’re not going to use those because we’d like to have something lighter for our first program. Because both of us are American football fans, we’ll play with the National Football League (NFL) offensive stats database. Here’s the link to the dataset we found if you want to look into it yourself: <a href="https://mng.bz/86pw">https://mng.bz/86pw</a>. The dataset has NFL information from 2019 to 2022 (figure 2.5).<span/></p>

<h4 class="readable-text-h3">Step 1: Understanding our dataset</h4>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p121">
<p class="calibre15">The nfl_offensive_stats.csv file is a comma-separated values (CSV) text file (refer to figure 2.5 for a portion of the file). This is a standard format for storing data. It has a header row at the top that explains what’s in every column. The way that we (or a computer) know the boundaries between columns is to use commas between cells. Also notice that each row is placed on its own line. Good news: Python has a bunch of tools for reading in CSV files.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p122">
<p class="calibre15">Let’s start by exploring what is stored in this file. To preview the file’s contents, you can look at it on the Kaggle webpage under Detail or download and open it in either VS Code or in spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel. Don’t worry about downloading and using this file just yet, that’s for later in the book. However, if you were to download and open it, here’s the start of the header (top) row (also shown earlier in figure 2.5):</p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p124">
<p class="calibre15">There are more columns, but these are enough for our first task. We’d like to know which quarterback has done the best over this time period.</p>

<h4 class="readable-text-h3">Step 2: How well did all the quarterbacks do over that time period?</h4>

<div class="readable-text" id="p126">
<p class="calibre15">If you don’t follow American football, that’s okay. You don’t need to know the game to follow along. Quarterbacks are responsible for throwing the football. We’ll start then with looking at how many yards they passed for in that time period. We only want to compare against other quarterbacks because they are the players whose job is to throw the ball. Sure, a running back might throw the ball once a season, and it’s often fun when they do, but it’s not really their job. To include only the quarterbacks, we’ll need to tell Copilot to limit our results to just players whose <em class="calibre18">Position</em> (the third column) is <em class="calibre18">QB</em> (stands for Quarterback). To solve this task, we created a new Python file called nfl_stats.py and had a conversation with Copilot that you can see in listing 2.1.</p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p129">
<p class="calibre15">If you chose to follow along with us and gave these prompts to Copilot, you might have gotten back different code.

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p131">
<p class="calibre15">As mentioned in both chapter 1 and this chapter, Copilot is nondeterministic, so what Copilot gives you may not match what it gives us. This is going to be a challenge for the rest of the book: What do you do if you get a wrong result when we get a right result? We’re fairly confident that Copilot will give you a correct answer here, but if you get a <em class="calibre18">wrong answer</em> from Copilot, go ahead and read the remainder of this section rather than working along with Copilot in VS Code. We’ll absolutely give you all the tools you need to fix the code when Copilot gives you a wrong answer, but that skill will be taught over the remainder of the book, so we don’t want you to get stuck on this now.</p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p132">
<p class="calibre15">Looking at the results from Copilot, we have to say this is quite impressive.

The good news is that anyone can use this powerful tool to do so much more than is possible to do without it.</p>

<p class="calibre15">To make this change, we’re just going to modify the prompt at the bottom. We went to the point in the code where it says the following:</p>

<p class="calibre15">We deleted the code, leaving just the comment, and added another line to the docstring:</p>

<h4 class="readable-text-h3">Reflecting on the example and the skills we need to write code with copilot</h4>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p146">
<p class="calibre15">Without writing any code ourselves, we were able to solve a large real-world task. However, you still need to learn some essential programming skills. We’ll teach you those skills in the upcoming chapters by solving a variety of tasks. By the end of chapter 7, you’ll be able to solve large tasks like these. We want you to take away the following from this example: </p>
</div>
<ul class="calibre24">
<li class="readable-text1" id="p147"> <em class="calibre18">Copilot is a powerful tool.</em> We didn’t write any code ourselves, but we were able to get Copilot to generate the code needed to perform some initial analysis of the data. If you’ve used spreadsheets, you can probably think of a way to do this using spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel, but it likely wouldn’t be as easy as writing code like this. Even if you haven’t used spreadsheets before, you’ve got to admit that it’s amazing that writing basic, human-readable prompts can produce correct code and output like this. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p148"> <em class="calibre18">Breaking problems into small tasks is important.</em> For this example, we tried writing this code with just a single large prompt (not shown) or by breaking it into smaller tasks. We found that Copilot was more apt to make mistakes when given one large task rather than multiple smaller tasks. In general, breaking the problem into smaller tasks significantly increases the likelihood of Copilot generating the right code. You’ll see how to break down larger problems into smaller tasks throughout the remainder of this book because this is one of the most important skills you’ll need. In fact, the upcoming chapter 3 will help you start understanding what are considered reasonable tasks to give to Copilot, and chapter 7 will be dedicated entirely to learning how to break down larger programs into smaller pieces. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p149"> <em class="calibre18">We still need to understand code to some degree.</em> This is true for several reasons. One is that writing good prompts requires a basic understanding of what computers know and what they don’t. We can’t just give a prompt to Copilot that says, “Give me the number of passing yards for Tom Brady.” Copilot likely wouldn’t be able to figure out where the data is stored, the format of the data, which columns correspond to players and passing yards, or that Tom Brady is a player. We had to spell details like that out to Copilot for it to be successful. Another reason has to do with determining whether code from Copilot is reasonable. When the two of us read the response from Copilot, we could determine what the code is doing because we know how to read code. You’ll need to be able to do this to some degree, which is why chapters 4 and 5 are dedicated to reading code. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p150"> <em class="calibre18">Testing is important.</em> We need to know if the code Copilot gave us is correct or not! When programmers talk about testing, they’re referring to the practice of making sure that their code works correctly, even in possibly unexpected circumstances. We didn’t spend much time on this piece, other than checking whether Copilot’s answer is plausible<span/> using estimates on just one dataset, but, in general, we’ll need to spend more time on testing because this is a critical part of the code-writing process. It likely goes without saying, but errors in code range from embarrassing (if you tell your hard-core NFL fan friend the wrong number of passing yards for a player) to dangerous (if software in a car behaves incorrectly) to costly (if businesses make decisions on wrong analyses). After you’ve learned how to read code, we have first-hand experience that even if the code looks correct, it might not be! To address this, we must test every piece of code created by Copilot to ensure it does what it should. You’ll learn how to rigorously test Copilot’s code in later chapters, especially chapter 6, which is dedicated to the skill. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p151"> <em class="calibre18">Python is powerful.</em> It’s okay if you missed this, but in listing 2.1, the code imported a module from Python’s libraries (<code class="calibre25">import</code> <code class="calibre25">csv</code>). Python has many built-in tools (called libraries) to help people accomplish their tasks. In this case, it was importing a library to make it easier to read and modify CSV files. We’ll harness more of these libraries in later chapters. </li>
</ul>
<div class="callout-container">
<div class="readable-text" id="p152">
<h5 class="callout-container-h">Python modules </h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p153">
<p class="calibre15">Python modules expand the capability of the programming language. There are many modules in Python, and they can help you do anything from data analysis to creating websites to writing video games. You can recognize when code wants to use a Python module by the <code class="calibre25">import</code> statement in the code. Some modules are built-in to Python, but there are thousands more that aren’t and that you need to manually install if you want to use them. Chapter 5 will show you how to use modules.</p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p154">
<p class="calibre15">In this chapter, we’ve accomplished a great deal! If you’ve finished setting up your programming environment and gotten started writing code with Copilot, you should be proud. You’ve taken a huge step toward writing software! Beyond the details of setting up your environment, you’ve seen where we’re headed by working through an example together.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p155">
<p class="calibre15">In the examples in this chapter, Copilot gave us the code we wanted without us needing to change the prompt or debug the code to figure out why it’s not working properly. That was a nice way to showcase the power of using an AI assistant to program, but you’ll often find yourself having to test the code, change the prompts, and sometimes try to understand why the code is wrong. This is the AI assistant programming process that you’ll learn more about in upcoming chapters.</p>
