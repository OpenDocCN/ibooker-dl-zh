<p>If you are reading this chapter, you have nearly climbed to the top of the DIKW pyramid and have built a fantastic chart. You should be delighted with your work and have probably already shown it to colleagues and perhaps even friends and relatives. It pains me, however, to tell you that your work is incomplete. The last piece is missing, the one that will transform your graph into a real story: wisdom. Wisdom is something very profound, which cannot be extracted simply from data. Wisdom also comes from one’s cultural background, experiences, and the ability to have good judgment. In this chapter, we will not make philosophical disquisitions on wisdom. Still, we will consider wisdom as the ability to propose the next steps for the audience to follow after interacting with our story. We will also use generative AI as a cultural background and shared experience to help us define the next steps. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p6">
<p>In this chapter, we will start with the basic concepts behind wisdom and next steps (at the top of the DIKW pyramid in the context of data storytelling). Next, we will review all the case studies described in this book in the light of the defined concept of wisdom. Finally, we will describe how to strategically place the next steps in the story. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p7">
<h2 class="readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">9.1</span> Introducing wisdom</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p8">
<p>The <em>Collins Dictionary</em> defines <em>wisdom</em> as “the ability to use experience and knowledge to make sensible decisions or judgments.” Applied to data storytelling, wisdom enables us to make better decisions based on our data. Wisdom helps us to continue the story after it has ended. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p9">
<p>Wisdom is not simply the result of transforming knowledge. It also requires other aspects that depend on our baggage in life. Wisdom is the result of a few different components:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p10"> <em>Knowledge</em> —This provides the foundation upon which wisdom is built. We cannot make informed decisions without a broad understanding of our data. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p11"> <em>Experience</em> —This provides the context through which our knowledge is applied. It deepens our understanding of the world and helps us to see the nuances and complexities that can’t be learned from books or lectures. Experience encompasses all the moments we’ve lived through, the challenges we’ve faced, and the lessons we’ve learned. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p12"> <em>Good judgment</em> —This is the ability to weigh the pros and cons of a situation, analyze the risks and benefits, and come to a well-informed and wise decision. It requires the ability to evaluate a situation from multiple perspectives and understand the potential outcomes of each choice. </li>
</ul>

<div class="readable-text" id="p15">
<p>Summarizing, we can say that wisdom comprises three main elements: knowledge synthesis, experience, and good judgment. Let’s investigate the three elements separately, starting with knowledge synthesis.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p16">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">9.1.1</span> Transforming knowledge into wisdom: Next steps</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p17">
<p>Every self-respecting story carries a <em>message</em>, something that remains in the hearts of the audience after reading the story. And this is the addition of wisdom to the story. Wisdom allows the audience to be engaged by the story, to be touched, and to be ready to do something after reading the story. However, the message alone is not enough. The audience must do something after reading the story.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p18">
<p>Transforming knowledge into wisdom involves adding the <em>next steps</em> to the data story. Next steps are the resolution of our data story and defining what the audience should do after reading the story.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p19">
<p>Every story ends with an <em>ending</em>, which can be good or bad, but there must be one. Even in the case of data storytelling, the addition of an ending to the story is envisaged. Unlike a novel, where the ending concludes the story, data storytelling should be an open story, in the sense that it should not end with the story itself but should expect the audience to do something after reading the story.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p20">
<p>To better understand the problem, let’s consider an example. Imagine you have started reading a beautiful novel. While you are reading about the protagonist’s adventures, suddenly, the novel ends without revealing how or whether the protagonist has overcome the challenges or solved the problems. Well, if you limit your chart only to the knowledge phase, it’s like a novel without an end. You shouldn’t just present your data findings; you should tell the viewer how you think they should act upon those findings. There’s a well-known saying that “knowledge is not power; it is potential power when used for action.” Here, then, in your chart, you must add what we’d call <em>next steps</em>. These are implemented as a call to action that invites your audience to do something. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p21">
<p>The next steps are not something dropped from the sky or, even worse, something theoretical. They are the results of your studies and analysis. They propose to your audience what to do after seeing your chart—for example, regarding possible alternatives or concrete steps to move forward. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p22">
<p>The next steps can never be just the fruit of the knowledge acquired through data. They must be anchored to something broader, commonly called <em>wisdom</em>. Wisdom is a cultural treasure trove derived from experience (from the data analyzed) and knowledge shared with others.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p23">
<p>Based on the context in which you live, the type of audience, and your values, the next steps must be anchored to an ethical framework. You cannot think of proposing a generic next step based only on your own beliefs or experience. It is necessary to anchor the next steps to the values of the society in which you live if they are to have broad application. These values vary from community to community, but fundamental principles must be respected, and the next steps must be anchored to them.</p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p26">
<p>Now, you have learned the different categories of next steps. Next, let’s see the second element contributing to defining wisdom, experience, and how we can use ChatGPT to help us generate it.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p27">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">9.1.2</span> Using ChatGPT as a source of experience</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p28">
<p>Traditionally, experience derives from our personal baggage, which has some limitations, especially if we don’t have much experience in a specific field. In addition to our personal experience, we can use generative AI knowledge to build “collective baggage,” to generate wisdom. So far, we have used generative AI only to generate content. Now, it’s time to use it as an assistant, a teammate, which assists us in thinking and elaborating concepts. While using generative AI in such a way, be careful about the ethical problems and other issues this may raise, which we will discuss in the next chapter. In practice, we will use ChatGPT as a source of experience. In addition to using our singular experience to propose next steps, we will use ChatGPT as another source of experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p29">
<p>To be more specific, in this chapter, we will use generative AI in two ways:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p30"> As a content generator, as we have done so far in the book </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p31"> As an assistant, helping us in thinking to transform knowledge into wisdom </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p32">
<p>In this section, we will focus only on the second point, since you already learned how to generate content with generative AI in the previous chapter. In particular, we will focus on ChatGPT.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p33">
<p>Imagine ChatGPT as your personal assistant for thinking. We will use ChatGPT as an assistant and, in particular, its ability to interact through an interactive chat, where it remembers the previous conversation. We can use ChatGPT as a natural interlocutor who helps us think and develop strategies. In this chapter, we will use ChatGPT only to propose the next steps, but in general, you can use all the cultural backgrounds of ChatGPT to generate new ideas. For ChatGPT to help us solve our problems, we need to formulate a prompt so that ChatGPT can understand it. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p34">
<p>Formulate a prompt consisting of three parts: </p>
</div>
<ol>
<li class="readable-text" id="p35"> A definition of the scenario </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p36"> A question </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p37"> A number of possible answers to generate </li>
</ol>
<div class="readable-text" id="p38">
<p>We can actually combine points 2 and 3 into a single point. After this initial prompt, we can discuss with ChatGPT and ask it to deepen one or more generated answers.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p39">
<p>We will see many applications of this prompt structure later in this chapter. For now, it is sufficient to remember this: scenario, question, number of answers.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p40">
<p>Once we have extracted an idea from ChatGPT, we can further investigate the topic by looking at additional external material. ChatGPT is only the first point. It acts as a source of ideas. Next, we need to verify the feasibility of ChatGPT’s proposals by consulting external materials and sources. Now that you have learned conceptually how to use ChatGPT’s cultural baggage as a source of experience, let’s move on to the following step: good judgment.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p41">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">9.1.3</span> Good judgment: Anchoring the action to an ethical framework</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p42">
<p><em>Good judgment</em> is assessing situations accurately and making decisions that align with one’s values and goals. In this chapter, we will implement good judgment by anchoring our message to an ethical framework. An ethical framework serves as a guideline for decision making based on principles that guide moral behavior. It provides a framework for evaluating the potential consequences of our actions and helps us identify the best course of action based on what is right and just.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p43">
<p>Actions not grounded in ethical considerations can lead to unintended consequences and may even cause harm. Some of the most popular ethical frameworks include the following (Berengueres, 2019):</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p44"> <em>Utilitarianism</em> —This framework bases ethical decisions on maximizing utility or happiness. According to this view, an action is right if it leads to the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p45"> <em>Deontology</em> —This framework focuses on following moral rules or duties. It argues that certain actions are inherently good or bad, regardless of their consequences. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p46"> <em>Virtue ethics</em> —This framework emphasizes the importance of developing virtues such as courage, honesty, and compassion. It argues that good people are more important than following rules or maximizing happiness. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p47"> <em>Care ethics</em> —This framework emphasizes the importance of relationships and empathy. It bases ethical decisions on caring for others and responding to their needs. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p48">
<p>Regardless of the ethical framework chosen, the next steps must be anchored within one if you wish to safeguard your call to action against misinterpretation or misuse. This means considering the potential impact of our actions on others and ensuring that they align with our values and principles. By doing so, we can move beyond simply making decisions based on what is expedient and toward creating positive change rooted in ethical considerations.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p49">
<p>To adapt next steps to a specific ethical framework, we can implement the following two phases:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p50"> Using ChatGPT to generate a preliminary text </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p51"> Revising the produced content </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p52">
<p>In the next sections, we will see how to implement these two phases. Now that you have learned the main concepts related to the three components of wisdom—knowledge synthesis, experience, and good judgment—let’s apply them to the case studies implemented throughout this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p53">
<h2 class="readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">9.2</span> Case studies</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p54">
<p>In this section, we will review all the case studies implemented throughout the book in the light of more focused next steps. As a quick reminder, figure 9.2 summarizes the case studies implemented in the previous chapters. Let’s start with the first case study, the dogs and cats campaign.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p57">
<p>Consider the case study we analyzed in chapter 1, the dogs and cats campaign. As a refresher, the case study focused on an event dedicated to pets (dogs and cats). For each pet category, the organizers strategically advertised the event on specialized websites dedicated to that particular pet category. As a result, 9 out of 10 pets participating in the event were cats. The next steps included improving the campaign related to the dog websites to increase the dog participants. Figure 9.3 shows the final data story related to this case study.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p59">
<p>The case study described in chapter 1 contained a generic next step, which invited the audience to increase the dog-related website campaign. Let’s implement a more focused next step, using the sharing category. To get some idea of practical implementation, let’s ask ChatGPT how we can practically improve these sharing opportunities. Let’s formulate the following prompt: <em>Consider the following scenario: a case study focuses on an event dedicated to pets (dogs and cats). For each pet category, the organizers strategically advertised the event on specialized websites dedicated to that particular pet category. As a result, 9 </em><em>out of 10 pets participating in the event were cats. Propose 5 ways to invite the audience to share information about the campaign related to the dog websites to increase the number of dog participants.</em> ChatGPT will write a list of five sharing options. Here is a possible list of options generated by ChatGPT:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p60"> Interactive contests or challenges </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p61"> Engaging social media campaigns </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p62"> Blogger outreach and partnerships </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p63"> Tailored email campaigns </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p64"> Community engagement and forums </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p65">
<p>Here, we have reported only the list of options. You can find the complete answer on ChatGPT’s site (<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/75475a1d-7dab-4487-858d-8288f7408737">https://chatgpt.com/share/75475a1d-7dab-4487-858d-8288f7408737</a>). We can elaborate on the previous options and, for example, reformulate them as three options: online campaign, influencer engagement, and social media promotion.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p66">
<p>Let’s implement the previous steps. We will implement the sharing options as three rectangles connected by a line, as shown in figure 9.4.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

Here are three possible options to increase the population growth in North America: enhance family-friend policies, develop immigration, and revitalize rural areas.

<p>So far, you have learned how to implement a variety of next steps. In the last case study, you’ll learn how to anchor your story to an ethical framework. Let’s apply this strategy to the salmon aquaculture case study implemented in the previous chapters.</p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p191">
<p>Consider the salmon aquaculture case study. As a quick recap, the salmon aquaculture case study aims to study the problem of safety in salmon aquaculture in the United States. So far, we have represented the dollars earned in the U.S. from salmon exports. We considered two scenarios: a positive one, where we focused on an increase in earnings, and a negative one, where we focused on the disease period. In this chapter, we only focus on the positive scenario, but you can easily adapt the described concepts to the negative one as well. Figure 9.18 shows the data story produced at the end of the previous chapter: turning information into knowledge.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

<p>Let’s suppose that as the next step for our data story, we want to propose some strategic actions to continue the positive increase in the amount of dollars trend line. We propose the following next steps:</p>

<li class="readable-text" id="p194"> Emphasize salmon safety measures. </li>

</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p197">
<p>Let’s use ChatGPT to adapt the proposed next steps to the different ethical frameworks. Use the following prompt for ChatGPT to generate the utilitarianism-based texts: <em>Consider the following ethical framework: utilitarianism.</em> This framework bases ethical decisions on maximizing utility or happiness. According to this view, an action is right if it leads to the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. </p>
