<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>In 2006, Geoffrey Hinton et al. published <a href="https://homl.info/hinton2006">a paper</a>⁠⁠<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id742-marker" href="preface01.html#id742">1</a></sup> showing how to train a deep neural network capable of recognizing handwritten digits with state-of-the-art precision (&gt;98%). They branded this technique “deep learning”.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="deep learning" data-seealso="deep neural networks" id="id743"/> A deep neural network is a (very) simplified model of our cerebral cortex, composed of a stack of layers of artificial neurons. Training a deep neural net was widely considered impossible at the time,⁠<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id744-marker" href="preface01.html#id744">2</a></sup> and most researchers had abandoned the idea in the late 1990s. This paper revived the interest of the scientific community, and before long many new papers demonstrated that deep learning was not only possible, but capable of mind-blowing achievements that no other machine learning (ML) technique could hope to match (with the help of tremendous computing power and great amounts of data). This enthusiasm soon extended to many other areas of machine learning.</p>

<p>A decade later, machine learning had already conquered many industries, ranking web results, recommending videos to watch and products to buy, sorting items on production lines, sometimes even driving cars. Machine learning often made the headlines, for example when DeepMind’s AlphaFold machine learning system solved a long-standing protein-folding problem that had stomped researchers for decades. But most of the time, machine learning was just working discretely in the background. However, another decade later came the rise of AI assistants: from ChatGPT in 2022, Gemini, Claude, and Grok in 2023, and many others since then. AI has now truly taken off and it is rapidly transforming every single industry: what used to be sci-fi is now very real.⁠<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id745-marker" href="preface01.html#id745">3</a></sup></p>

<h1>Machine Learning in Your Projects</h1>

<p>So, naturally you are excited about machine learning and would love to join the party! Perhaps you would like to give your homemade robot a brain of its own? Make it recognize faces? Or learn to walk around?</p>

<p>Or maybe your company has tons of data (user logs, financial data, production data, machine sensor data, hotline stats, HR reports, etc.), and more than likely you could unearth some hidden gems if you just knew where to look. With machine learning, you could accomplish the following <a href="https://homl.info/usecases">and much more</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Segment customers and find the best marketing strategy for each group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommend products for each client based on what similar clients bought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detect which transactions are likely to be fraudulent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forecast next year’s revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Predict peak workloads and suggest optimal staffing levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build a chatbot to assist your customers.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever the reason, you have decided to learn machine learning and implement it in your projects. Great idea!</p>
</div></section>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Objective and Approach"><div class="sect1" id="id2">
<h1>Objective and Approach</h1>

<p>This book assumes that you know close to nothing about machine learning. Its goal is to give you the concepts, tools, and intuition you need to implement programs capable of <em>learning from data</em>.</p>

<p>We will cover a large number of techniques, from the simplest and most commonly used (such as linear regression) to some of the deep learning techniques that regularly win competitions. For this, we will be using Python—the leading language for data science and machine learning—as well as open source and production-ready Python frameworks:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://scikit-learn.org">Scikit-Learn</a> <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Scikit-Learn" id="id746"/>is very easy to use, yet it implements many machine learning algorithms efficiently, so it makes for a great entry point to learning machine learning. It was created by David Cournapeau in 2007, then led by a team of researchers at the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (Inria), and recently Probabl.ai.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org">PyTorch</a> <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="PyTorch" data-seealso="torch" id="id747"/>is a powerful and flexible library for deep learning. It makes it possible to train and run all sorts of neural networks efficiently, and it can distribute the computations across multiple GPUs (graphics processing units). PyTorch (PT) was developed by Facebook’s AI Research lab (FAIR) and first released in 2016. It evolved from Torch, an older framework coded in Lua. In 2022, PyTorch was transitioned to the PyTorch Foundation, under the Linux Foundation, to promote community-driven development.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also use these open source machine learning libraries along the way:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io">XGBoost</a> in <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ensembles_chapter">Chapter 6</a> to implement a powerful technique called <em>gradient boosting</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://huggingface.co">Hugging Face</a> libraries in Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch13.html#rnn_chapter">13</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch15.html#transformer_chapter">15</a> to download datasets and pretrained models, including transformer models. Transformers are incredibly powerful and versatile, and they are the main building block of virtually all AI assistants today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org">Gymnasium</a> in <a data-type="xref" href="ch19.html#rl_chapter">Chapter 19</a> for reinforcement learning (i.e., training autonomous agents).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The book favors a hands-on approach, growing an intuitive understanding of machine learning through concrete working examples and just a little bit of theory.</p>
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>
<p>While you can read this book without picking up your laptop, I highly recommend you experiment with the code examples.</p>
</div>
</div></section>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Code Examples"><div class="sect1" id="id716">
<h1>Code Examples</h1>

<p>All the code examples in this book are open source and available online at <a href="https://github.com/ageron/handson-mlp" class="bare"><em class="hyperlink">https://github.com/ageron/handson-mlp</em></a>, as Jupyter notebooks. These are interactive documents containing text, images, and executable code snippets (Python in our case). The easiest and quickest way to get started is to run these notebooks using Google Colab: this is a free service that allows you to run any Jupyter notebook directly online without having to install anything on your machine. All you need is a web browser and a Google account.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>In this book, I will assume that you are using Google Colab, but I have also tested the notebooks on other online platforms such as Kaggle and Binder, so you can use those if you prefer. Alternatively, you can install the required libraries and tools (or the Docker image for this book) and run the notebooks directly on your own machine. See the instructions at <a href="https://homl.info/install-p" class="bare"><em class="hyperlink">https://homl.info/install-p</em></a>.</p>
</div>

<p>This book is here to help you get your job done. If you wish to use additional content beyond the code examples, and that use falls outside the scope of fair use guidelines, (such as selling or distributing content from O’Reilly books, or incorporating a significant amount of material from this book into your product’s documentation), please reach out to O’Reilly for permission, at <a class="email" href="mailto:permissions@oreilly.com"><em>permissions@oreilly.com</em></a>.</p>

<p>We appreciate, but generally do not require, attribution. An attribution usually includes the title, author, publisher, and ISBN. For example: “<em>Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and PyTorch</em> by Aurélien Geron. Copyright 2026 Aurélien Geron, 979-8-341-60798-9.”</p>
</div></section>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Prerequisites"><div class="sect1" id="id717">
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<p>This book assumes that you have some Python programming experience. If you don’t know Python yet, <a href="https://learnpython.org" class="bare"><em class="hyperlink">https://learnpython.org</em></a> is a great place to start. The official tutorial on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial">Python.org</a> is also quite good.</p>

<p>This book also assumes that you are familiar with Python’s main scientific libraries—in particular, <a href="https://numpy.org">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org">pandas</a>, and <a href="https://matplotlib.org">Matplotlib</a>. If you have never used these libraries, don’t worry; they’re easy to learn, and I’ve created a tutorial for each of them. You can access them online at <a href="https://homl.info/tutorials-p" class="bare"><em class="hyperlink">https://homl.info/tutorials-p</em></a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, if you want to fully understand how the machine learning algorithms work (not just how to use them), then you should have at least a basic understanding of a few math concepts, especially linear algebra. Specifically, you should know what vectors and matrices are, and how to perform some simple operations like adding vectors, or transposing and multiplying matrices. If you need a quick introduction to linear algebra (it’s really not rocket science!), I provide a tutorial at <a href="https://homl.info/tutorials-p" class="bare"><em class="hyperlink">https://homl.info/tutorials-p</em></a>. You will also find a tutorial on differential calculus, which may be helpful to understand how neural networks are trained, but it’s not entirely essential to grasp the important concepts. This book also uses other mathematical concepts occasionally, such as exponentials and logarithms, a bit of probability theory, and some basic concepts from statistics, but nothing too advanced. If you need help on any of these, please check out <a href="https://khanacademy.org" class="bare"><em class="hyperlink">https://khanacademy.org</em></a>, which offers many excellent and free math courses online.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Roadmap"><div class="sect1" id="id718">
<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<p>This book is organized in two parts. <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part01.html#fundamentals_part">Part I, “The Fundamentals of <span class="keep-together">Machine Learning</span>”</a>, covers the following topics:</p>

<ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>The steps in a typical machine learning project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning by fitting a model to data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimizing a cost function (i.e., a measure of prediction errors)</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Selecting and engineering features (i.e., data fields)</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part02.html#neural_nets_part">Part II, “Neural Networks and Deep Learning”</a>, covers the following topics:</p>

<ul>

</li>
</ul>

<p>The first part is based mostly on Scikit-Learn; the second part uses mostly PyTorch.</p>
<div data-type="caution"><h6>Caution</h6>
<p>Don’t jump into deep waters too hastily: deep learning is no doubt one of the most exciting areas in machine learning, but you should master the fundamentals first. Moreover, many problems can be solved quite well using simpler techniques such as random forests and ensemble methods (discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="part01.html#fundamentals_part">Part I</a>). Deep learning is best suited for complex problems such as image recognition, speech recognition, or natural language processing, and it often requires a lot of data, computing power, and patience (unless you can leverage a pretrained neural network, as you will see).</p>
</div>

<p>If you are particularly interested in one topic and want to reach it as quickly as possible, <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter_dependencies_diagram">Figure P-1</a> will show you which chapters you must read first, and which ones you can safely skip.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Changes Between the TensorFlow and PyTorch Versions"><div class="sect1" id="id719">
<h1>Changes Between the TensorFlow and PyTorch Versions</h1>

<p>I wrote three TensorFlow (TF) editions of this book, published by O’Reilly in 2017, 2019, and 2022. TF was the leading deep learning library for many years, used internally by Google and therefore optimized for production at scale. But PyTorch has gradually taken the lead, owing to its simplicity, flexibility and openness: it now dominates research papers and open source projects, which means that most new models are available in PyTorch first. As a result, the industry has also gradually shifted toward PyTorch.</p>

<p>In recent years, Google has reduced its investments in TensorFlow, and focused more on JAX, another excellent deep learning library with a great mix of qualities for both research and production. However, its adoption is still low compared to PyTorch.</p>

<p>This is why I chose to use PyTorch this time around! O’Reilly and I decided to make it the first edition of a new PyTorch series rather than the fourth edition of the original series. This leaves the door open for a JAX series or perhaps a new edition for the TF series (time will tell if either are needed).</p>

<p>If you have already read the latest TensorFlow version of this book, here are the main changes you will find in this book (see <a href="https://homl.info/changes-p" class="bare"><em class="hyperlink">https://homl.info/changes-p</em></a> for more details):</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>All the code in the book was updated to recent library versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the code in <a data-type="xref" href="part02.html#neural_nets_part">Part II</a> was migrated from TensorFlow and Keras to PyTorch. There were significant changes in all of these chapters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TensorFlow-specific content was removed, including former Chapters 12 and 13, and former Appendices C and D.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#pytorch_chapter">Chapter 10</a> now introduces PyTorch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also added three new chapters on transformers:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch15.html#transformer_chapter">Chapter 15</a> covers transformers for natural language processing, including how to build a chatbot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch16.html#vit_chapter">Chapter 16</a> presents vision transformers and multimodal transformers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch17.html#speedup_chapter">Chapter 17</a>, available online at <a href="https://homl.info/" class="bare"><em class="hyperlink">https://homl.info/</em></a>, discusses several advanced techniques to speed up and scale up transformers. This includes FlashAttention, mixture of experts (MoE), low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and many more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are also three new appendices: <a data-type="xref" href="app02.html#precision_appendix">Appendix B</a> explains how to shrink models so they can run faster and fit on smaller devices, “Relative Positional Encoding” discusses advanced positional encoding techniques for transformers, and “State-Space Models (SSMs)” presents state-space models.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="less_space pagebreak-before">
<li>
<p>To make room for the newer content, the chapter on support vector machines (SVMs) was <a href="https://homl.info">moved online</a> and renamed “Support Vector Machines”; the last two appendices are also online at the same URL, and the deployment chapter was partially merged into <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#pytorch_chapter">Chapter 10</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The three editions of the TensorFlow/Keras version of this book are nicknamed homl1, homl2, and homl3. This book, which is the first edition of the PyTorch version, is nicknamed homlp. Try saying that three times in a row.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>Most of the changes compared to the latest TensorFlow edition are in the second part of the book. If you have read homl3, then don’t expect big changes in the first part of the book: the fundamental concepts of machine learning haven’t changed since 2022.</p>
</div>

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that the three TensorFlow editions of this book would reach such a large audience. I received so many messages from readers, many asking questions, some kindly pointing out errata, and most sending me encouraging words. I cannot express how grateful I am to all these readers for their tremendous support. Thank you all so very much! Please do not hesitate to <a href="https://homl.info/issues-p">file issues on GitHub</a> if you find errors in the code examples (or just to ask questions), or to submit <a href="https://homl.info/errata-p">errata</a> if you find errors in the text. Some readers also shared how this book helped them get their first job, or how it helped them solve a concrete problem they were working on. I find such feedback incredibly motivating. If you find this book helpful, I would love it if you could share your story with me, either privately (e.g., via <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/aurelien-geron">LinkedIn</a>) or publicly (e.g., tweet me at @aureliengeron or write an <a href="https://homl.info/amazon-p">Amazon review</a>).</p>

<p>Huge thanks as well to all the generous people who offered their time and expertise to review this book, correcting errors and making countless suggestions. They made this book so much better: Jeremy Howard, Haesun Park, Omar Sanseviero, Lewis Tunstall, Leandro Von Werra, and Sam Witteveen reviewed the table of contents and helped me refine the scope of the book. Hesam Hassani, Ashu Jha, Meetu Malhotra, and Ammar Mohanna reviewed the first part, while Ulf Bissbort, Louis-Francois Bouchard, Luba Elliot, Thomas Lacombe, Tarun Narayanan, Marco Tabor, and my dear brother Sylvain reviewed the second part. Special thanks to Haesun Park, who reviewed every single chapter. You are all amazing!</p>

<p>Of course, this book would not exist without the fantastic staff at O’Reilly. I am especially indebted to Michele Cronin, who reviewed every chapter and supported me weekly for a whole year. I am also deeply grateful to Nicole Butterfield for leading this project and helping refine the book’s scope, and to the production 
<span class="keep-together">team—particularly</span> Beth Kelly and Kristen Brown—who did a remarkable job. I want to acknowledge Sonia Saruba for her countless careful copyedits, Kate Dullea for making my diagrams much prettier, and Susan Thompson for the beautiful orangutan on the cover.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I am infinitely grateful to my beloved wife, Emmanuelle, and to our three wonderful children—Alexandre, Rémi, and Gabrielle—for encouraging me to work so hard on this book. Their insatiable curiosity was priceless: explaining some of the most difficult concepts in this book to my wife and children helped me clarify my own thoughts and directly improved many parts of it. Plus, they kept bringing me cookies and coffee. Who could ask for more?</p>
