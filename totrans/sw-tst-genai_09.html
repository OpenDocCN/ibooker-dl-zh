<p class="body">So far, we’ve explored how large language models (LLMs) can help us with a range of testing activities and artifacts that are algorithmic. Activities such as code and data generation have distinct syntax and formatting rules, and come with a certain degree of repeatability that works well with LLMs. But what about the more heuristic-based testing activities, such as exploratory testing? How can LLMs support us when we are executing testing ourselves? It’s important to repeat that LLMs cannot replace testing or testers, but by carefully observing what we’re doing during exploratory testing and knowledge of prompt engineering, we can selectively enhance our exploring in a way that doesn’t undermine the core value of exploratory testing. To do this, we’ll examine the following three aspects of exploratory testing and how LLMs can help: organizing exploratory testing with charters, performing exploratory testing, and reporting what we’ve discovered.</p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">
<p class="fm-sidebar-title">Algorithmic and heuristic-based activities</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">When we refer to an activity as being heuristic-based, we’re specifying that the activity doesn’t have clear steps to carry out or is difficult to define explicitly, whereas algorithmic activities are more procedural in nature and can be defined in explicit terms. In the context of testing, test cases and scripts can be seen as algorithmic in nature, whereas exploratory testing is more heuristic because it relies on human ability to observe and analyze situations to determine next actions.<a id="idIndexMarker001"/><a id="idIndexMarker002"/></p>
</div>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_3">8.1 Organizing exploratory testing with LLMs</h2>
<p class="body">Let’s begin by focusing on how LLMs can help us identify charters for exploratory testing. Normally, when performing exploratory testing sessions, they are guided by a test charter such as:<a id="idIndexMarker003"/><a id="marker-156"/><a id="idIndexMarker004"/></p>

<p class="body">In this charter example, we’re following the charter template proposed by Elisabeth Hendrickson in her book <i class="fm-italics">Explore It</i> (from Pragmatic Bookshelf):<a id="idIndexMarker005"/><a id="idIndexMarker006"/></p>
<table border="0" class="contenttable-0-table" width="100%">

<p class="body">It’s from these charters that we can frame what we want to focus our exploratory testing on and what to ignore. The idea is to have many different charters exploring features and products from different perspectives, or more specifically, different risks. When generating charters, we ideally want to be deriving them from risks, so that when we run exploratory testing based on charters, we know the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">What priority we should put our charters in (the higher the risk, the higher the priority)</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">What risks have been explored and what haven’t</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">What value we are getting from each exploratory testing session</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">To put this into a visual model, figure 8.1 demonstrates the relationship between risks, charters, and exploratory testing sessions.</p>
<p class="body">The model shows that we first identify risks, which are then codified into charters, and it’s those charters that we can run multiple exploratory testing sessions on to see what we can learn.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 8.1 A visual model showing the relationship between risks, charters, and exploratory testing</p>
</div>
<p class="body">Identifying risks and charters is predominantly a heuristic-based activity, as there is no clear pattern or procedure that can be followed to identify risks. It’s based on a tester and their team’s critical and lateral thinking skills. However, the structured nature of how we format risks into charters means there are times when LLMs can help augment our existing skills and increase our coverage.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_4">8.1.1 Augmenting identified risks with LLMs</h3>
<p class="body">Because identifying risks is a heuristic-based activity, it is subject to bias. This means that, at times, we can miss potential risks requiring our attention (for example, functional fixedness cognitive bias in which we are so focused on observing one event that we completely miss another). So, how do we prevent these gaps from appearing? Testers work hard to develop their skills to embrace and handle such biases and utilize testing heuristics to help us change our perspectives when identifying risks. But we can also use LLMs as an additional tool to help us consider different avenues and perhaps highlight potential risks we hadn’t considered.<a id="idIndexMarker007"/><a id="idIndexMarker008"/><a id="idIndexMarker009"/><a id="marker-157"/></p>
<p class="body">To help demonstrate how they can help, let’s explore a sample user story that has been created by a team:</p>
<table border="0" class="contenttable-0-table" width="100%">
<colgroup class="contenttable-0-colgroup">
<col class="contenttable-0-col" span="1" width="7%"/>
<col class="contenttable-0-col" span="1" width="93%"/>
</colgroup>
<tbody class="contenttable-0-tbody">
<tr class="contenttable-0-tr">
<td class="contenttable-0-td"/>
<td class="contenttable-0-td">
<p class="body-table-list-a">   •   In order to manage my bookings as an administrator I want to be able to view a report of all my bookings</p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   •   Acceptance Criteria:</p>
<p class="body-table-list-b">   <span class="cambria">−</span>   Given I am logged in as an administrator, and I have multiple bookings made, when I load a report page then I am presented with my bookings in a monthly calendar view and the month selected is the current month</p>

<p class="body-table-list-b">   <span class="cambria">−</span>   Given I am on the report page when I click and drag across multiple dates then I am presented with a new booking form with the following fields| firstname | lastname | room | deposit paid |</p>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="body">Using examples, the user story details how we would expect the feature to work from a user perspective. It’s this type of user story that we would typically come across in a planning session (with perhaps more or less detail), and it would be used as a jumping-off point to start discussing how it will be built and, equally important, what risks could affect the quality of our feature. Typically, this is where testers or quality-minded individuals would take time to ask questions and note down potential risks for further investigation. For example, a basic list of risks might contain the following items:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Bookings are not shown in the report view.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Report view is hard to parse.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Navigation controls don’t work correctly.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Admin bookings can’t be submitted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">This is a great start, but it feels insufficient. This list emulates situations in which we may find ourselves struggling to identify further risks, so at this time, we can opt to use a prompt like the following to help expand our analysis. We use delimiter tactic in instructions to distinguish different data sets being sent:</p>
<table border="0" class="contenttable-0-table" width="100%">

<p class="body">In this prompt, we’re providing three different sets of data to help guide the LLM:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Quality characteristics</i>—Quality characteristics help us define what quality means to our end users. For example, the quality characteristic of a trading platform might be quite different from the characteristics of a personal assistant app. Adding these to our prompt helps us make explicit which areas of risks we’re interested in and prevents an LLM from hallucinating risks that are irrelevant or not of interest.<a id="marker-158"/><a id="idIndexMarker010"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">User story</i>—We provide the user story to give the prompt context. Once again, the more description we can provide around what a feature is expected to do, the more we will maximize the relevance of the risks that the LLM will output.<a id="idIndexMarker011"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Current risks</i>—Finally, providing existing risks prevents the LLM from simply outputting information we already have. By asking the LLM to work out solutions before outputting risks, we ensure that the risks being output are new for consideration. That doesn’t mean that its output is more useful but that it helps frame what we’ve been thinking about.<a id="idIndexMarker012"/><a id="marker-159"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">The goal of this prompt is to have an LLM provide additional risks that could be added to our existing list. For example, sending the prompt to ChatGPT returned the following output:</p>

</table>
<p class="body">The first thing to observe is that ChatGPT has effectively categorized the proposed risks by quality characteristics. The second observation is how each risk comes with a short sentence to explain it further. This can help us contextualize the risks it has output or spark ideas around further risks.</p>
<p class="body">Looking at the list of proposed risks, some stand out as useful and relevant to our user story, such as:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">User confusion</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Error handling</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Missing bookings in report refresh</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Data integrity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">Further analysis shows that some risks displayed are almost a repetition of one another: for example, <code class="fm-code-in-text">Navigation</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">controls</code> in the <code class="fm-code-in-text">usability</code> category and <code class="fm-code-in-text">Incorrect Navigation</code> in the <code class="fm-code-in-text">accuracy</code> category (note that these are not duplicates of our original risks). Although they are worded differently, the focus appears to be the same: navigation controls not working properly. The combination of new risks and repetition demonstrates that LLMs can be a useful tool for expanding our risk analysis, but they do not serve as a replacement for our ability to identify risks. So, after reading the list of risks from ChatGPT, we may choose to expand our list of risks to include</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Bookings are not shown in the report view.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Report view is hard to parse.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Navigation controls don’t work correctly.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Admin bookings can’t be submitted.</p>

<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Confusion over how to use the report controls and admin booking.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Errors are not handled correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-160"/>In our final list, we have chosen to adopt and reframe some of the risks received from ChatGPT and have ignored others. If we are not satisfied, we can ask ChatGPT to return more risks to review. However, there is a tradeoff that if we request more risks, we face an increased chance of repetition creeping into ChatGPT’s responses. Once we’re happy with our list, we can begin to convert these into charters and return to an LLM for further assistance for ideas.</p>

<p class="body">Again, what this demonstrates is that LLMs can help us expand our options and identify new avenues to explore. But they are by no means perfect. And while tweaking prompts to make them more reliable can certainly help, we should always be selective in what to take from an LLM and what to ignore, which once again can be summarized using the area of effect model, as shown in figure 8.2.<a id="marker-163"/><a id="idIndexMarker019"/></p>
<p class="body">Our ability to think creatively and use lateral and critical thinking skills to identify and organize our exploratory testing is essential. In this example, LLMs give us a way to shake things up when we’re out of ideas.</p>

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_6">8.2 Using LLMs during exploratory testing</h2>
<p class="body">We’ve seen how we can work with LLMs to organize exploratory testing. Now let’s take a look at how to use LLMs as we perform exploratory testing.<a id="idIndexMarker025"/><a id="idIndexMarker026"/><a id="marker-164"/></p>
<p class="body">What makes the use of LLMs in exploratory testing so interesting is the mix of activities that might occur during an exploratory testing session. There are technical elements to a session in which we need to rely on tools to manipulate a system in a specific way, and there are heuristic human-driven elements where we employ mental heuristics and oracles to make sense of what we’ve learned and use it to inspire further testing. Both aspects can be supported with the use of LLMs, so to help us better appreciate where to get the most value, let’s explore a use case of an exploratory testing session in which the following charter was used:</p>

<p class="body">To help contextualize the session further, the goal of the session was to test the rendering of the report page, as shown in figure 8.3.</p>

<p class="body">The calendar in the report page renders all the bookings that exist for each room within the application, and our goal is to learn how it functions when there are many bookings, specifically learning how it might affect the rendering and usability of the calendar. This means there were challenges to overcome around understanding how data is sent to the calendar, how to create it quickly, and what types of testing aligned with the charter we might carry out.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_7">8.2.1 Establishing an understanding</h3>
<p class="body">The first challenge is to understand how the report data arrived into the calendar, which means analyzing the <code class="fm-code-in-text">Report</code> API code to better understand it.

This in turn allowed me to model the data-retrieval process into a visualization similar to the one in figure 8.4.</p>
<p class="body">The model is based on the information from the prompt to determine how the data is created and helped clarify how I needed to go about creating the required data. This is a great way to rapidly build understanding, but as always, it’s important to ratify that understanding and mitigate risks of LLM hallucinations. That’s why I visually modeled the process afterward so that the visualization can be easily shared with others to confirm whether my assumptions were correct or needed updating.</p>

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_9">8.2.3 Exploring and investigating bugs</h3>
<p class="body">With the test data in place, I was able to try out a collection of test ideas inspired by the charter for this session, including the following:<a id="idIndexMarker045"/><a id="idIndexMarker046"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">What happens when I load the page?</i> I discovered that I could see bookings in the calendar view and that additional bookings needed to be viewed by clicking the “View more” text for a specific day. I also learned that the page was very slow to load data when lots of bookings were in place.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">What happens when I work with navigation controls?</i> Similar to previous observations, the calendar was slow to load when navigating between months. But I was able to navigate through the calendar despite the page slowness.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">What if I wanted to view more bookings?</i> I discovered a bug around the pop-up that shows additional bookings for the day flow off the top of the page, so certain bookings could not be read. It was also slow to load the pop-up for days with considerable bookings.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Can I access the calendar using a keyboard?</i> I found that I was able to tab through the main view of the calendar successfully and that hitting Enter on a “View more” link opens up the pop-up with additional bookings. I also found bugs around tabbing into a pop-up in which I was unable to focus on bookings that overflowed out of the bounds of the page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">What each of these ideas has in common is they were identified using mental heuristics I have developed after years of exploratory testing. This concept of the use of unconscious heuristics, ones that have been internalized through experience, is explored in the article “Mind the Gap,” by Richard Bradshaw and Sarah Deery: <a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/yoRJ">https://mng.bz/yoRJ</a>. It talks about how we use both conscious and subconscious heuristics to guide our exploratory testing. In the context of my exploratory testing so far, I have relied on unconscious heuristics. However, as I came to the point in which my ideas were running dry, I turned to more explicit conscious heuristics to generate further test ideas—for example, using the test mnemonic PAOLO.<a id="idIndexMarker047"/><a id="marker-171"/><a id="idIndexMarker048"/></p>
<p class="body">PAOLO is a mnemonic, created by Maik Nog, that serves as a tool to trigger test ideas around the screen orientation and rendering. Each letter stands for a different aspect of orientation and rendering to consider, specifically:<a id="idIndexMarker049"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Portrait</i>— How does it look in Portrait view?</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Audio</i>— Are there audio artifacts to consider?</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Objects</i>— What other objects are in view that need considering?</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Landscape</i>—How does it look in the Landscape view?</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Overlay</i>—Are there overlays to consider?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">The value of mnemonics is that they help trigger different ideas for different individuals—which is a blessing and a curse as we are still somewhat reliant on our personal experiences and biases to generate new ideas. So, to help break out of my thinking, I created a new prompt using the PAOLO mnemonic to see what ideas I might get from an LLM. In the first prompt, we set instructions, use the delimiter tactic, and provide context:</p>

<p class="body"><a id="marker-172"/>In this prompt, I need to provide some context around what I want test ideas generated for.

<p class="body-table">How the report calendar displays in portrait mode across different screen sizes and resolutions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="body">This triggered the idea of zooming in and out of the calendar to observe what would happen, resulting in the discovery of performance problems when zooming out and the calendar hiding the Show More Buttons link when zoomed in. The next prompt idea was:</p>
<table border="0" class="contenttable-0-table" width="100%">

<p class="body">This triggered the question: What if I try out different screen sizes? Attempting to view the calendar with different mobile screen sizes found yet more performance problems as the page attempted to organize itself for the new view. However, the calendar ultimately did handle different views nicely. Finally, I chose the prompt idea:</p>
<table border="0" class="contenttable-0-table" width="100%">

</tbody>
</table>
<p class="body">I followed this suggestion more explicitly and discovered that, on mobile screen sizes, text is tiny and hard to read.</p>
<p class="body">There were more ideas I used and more that I could potentially explore, but as this was a session to demonstrate the value of LLMs in exploratory testing, I chose to end the session and collate my notes for future reporting.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_10">8.2.4 Using LLMs to assist exploratory testing</h3>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-173"/>This use case demonstrates again how LLMs can be employed to fast-track us through specific technical needs, such as data generation, and act as a suggestion engine when we need new ideas. At no point was the LLM in charge of the exploratory testing. It was utilized to help me as I progressed—all of which can be defined, once again, using the area of effect model shown in figure 8.5.<a id="idIndexMarker050"/><a id="idIndexMarker051"/></p>
<p class="body">The key skill is to be able to identify when an LLM could be of use to us in a way that doesn’t disrupt the flow of exploratory testing. This is where creating a library of prompts can become useful. By building a library of prompts, we begin to identify the pain points at which LLMs can help solidify our appreciation of when to use them. Then, once we’re in a session, we can quickly copy in a prompt of our choosing, generate the required response, and move on rapidly.</p>

<p class="body"><a id="marker-174"/>Once an exploratory testing session is concluded, the results need to be reported to relevant individuals, which can be challenging, unlike the reporting of other testing activities.

The problem is that if we are asked to share details about a session that was run in the past, our notes can go only so far as to prompt our memory.</p>

<p class="body-table">Test Story: Exploring Bookings Rendering in Report View</p>
<p class="body-table">In a recent exploratory testing session, I delved into the rendering of bookings within the report view interface, focusing on the display of a large volume of bookings. The primary goal was to assess the readability and functionality when dealing with extensive booking data.</p>
<p class="body-table">Session Overview</p>
<p class="body-table">I commenced the session by analyzing the code structures in the APIs associated with rooms and bookings to comprehend data generation for the report page. Here’s a breakdown of my exploration:</p>
<p class="body-table">Data Setup:</p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   *   Explored generating test data for the report page, resulting in creating test data for both the room and booking APIs.</p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   *   Encountered challenges in rebuilding the booking API due to test data integration issues, necessitating direct manipulation via the IDE.</p>
<p class="body-table">Investigation:</p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   *   Loading Page Performance:</p>
<p class="body-table-list-b">   *   Observed significant slowness in loading the page when a substantial number of bookings were present.</p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   *   Navigation Controls:</p>
<p class="body-table-list-b">   *   Noted slowness in the calendar view when navigating between busy and quiet months, although navigation remained functional.</p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   *   Viewing Bookings:</p>
<p class="body-table-list-b">   *   Discovered issues with the popup displaying bookings, causing overflow and making certain bookings unreadable.</p>
<p class="body-table-list-b">   *   Encountered delays in loading the popup for days with numerous bookings.</p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   *   Creating New Bookings:</p>
<p class="body-table-list-b">   *   Identified a delay issue when canceling the creation of a new booking, impacting the calendar component’s rendering time.</p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   *   Keyboard Accessibility:</p>
<p class="body-table-list-b">   *   Successful tab navigation through the calendar but faced challenges with tabbing into and navigating within popups.</p>
<p class="body-table">Further Explorations:</p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   *   Tested the calendar’s behavior under different scenarios, such as resizing, zooming, and device orientation changes, revealing multiple rendering and display issues across various screen sizes and orientations.</p>
<p class="body-table">Bugs Identified:<a id="marker-176"/></p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   1.  Page loading significantly slows down with a high volume of bookings.</p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   2.  Calendar navigation experiences slowness when transitioning between busy and quiet months.</p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   3.  Popup for viewing bookings overflows and obstructs readability for certain bookings.</p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   4.  Delay issue when canceling the creation of a new booking affects calendar rendering.</p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   5.  Accessibility issues with keyboard navigation within popups.</p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   6.  Slow rendering and content disappearance when resizing and zooming the calendar.</p>
<p class="body-table-list-a">   7.  Text readability problems on mobile devices due to small font size.</p>

<p class="body">The LLM has managed to successfully convert my exploratory testing notes, which are a mix of headers and short sentences and are somewhat structureless in form (the raw notes can be found in appendix C for comparison), into a much richer report. It starts with a summary of the exploratory testing as a whole and what my intention was before going into the session details.</p>
<p class="body">Reviewing this report demonstrates a choice that can be made when using LLMs. The report shows heavy use of bullet points and numbered lists, a pattern that is quite common for ChatGPT. However, we could fix this by applying additional instructions or specific template structures to the prompt. For example, if we updated our prompt to use the Cornell method (<a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/M1M2">https://mng.bz/M1M2</a>):<a id="idIndexMarker056"/><a id="marker-177"/></p>

<p class="body">Experimentation is key here, but what this demonstrates is that LLMs have the potential to support us in ways that other, more traditional tools are unable to. Reporting sometimes gets short shrift in testing because rapidly sharing a wealth of knowledge can be difficult, which encourages teams to rely on more quantitative, test script-based reports that we normally see. However, with the use of LLMs, we can now structure and present reports that give a fuller picture of what we’ve learned during exploratory testing, sharing the rich information that hides behind the numbers of how many test scripts or sessions have been run.<a id="idIndexMarker058"/><a id="idIndexMarker059"/><a id="idIndexMarker060"/><a id="marker-179"/></p>
