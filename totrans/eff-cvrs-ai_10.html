   <p>Unnecessary complexity is painful for chatbot users and builders alike, and it often leads to bad business outcomes or delays in the deployment timeline. Building a conversation that feels simple and natural requires thoughtful design and empathy for the user’s situation. As designers and builders of these solutions, we aim to create an experience that helps a user reach their goal with the least amount of hassle or difficulty. Why should we be so accommodating? Because we need users to adopt or accept the solution in order to justify the cost of maintaining the technology. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p7"> 
   <p>Users will associate a “natural” conversational experience with “simple” or “easy to use.” An interface that is easy to use tends to result in the most successful outcomes. Conversely, an experience that has not properly considered the user’s perspective often feels disorienting, unnatural, and perhaps overly complicated. This can cause users to escalate, abandon the conversation, or fail to reach an optimal outcome. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p8"> 
   <p>In this chapter, we’ll discuss complexity from the perspectives of the user and the business. Sometimes there are unavoidable tradeoffs involved in reducing complexity for the user. We will discuss the tradeoffs you may encounter when trying to solve user pain points and how to prioritize or implement next-best alternatives.</p>

   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">8.1</span> The pain of complexity</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p10"> 
   <p>Complexity is a double-edged sword: it can add friction or failure points to a task-oriented conversation, but without it, we often can’t accomplish the more useful transactions. Simple FAQ-style bots are rarely complex, but they can be limited in their usefulness. Users who need to accomplish a task often require a bot that can do more than tell them <em>how</em> to do something—they need it to perform some sort of action for them (or on their behalf). Take, for example, a user who needs to know how much money they have in their checking account. An FAQ bot may simply tell a user how to check their account balance, but the user’s goal is not yet satisfied. A self-service bot would provide the user’s actual account balance, which does satisfy their goal. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p11"> 
   <p>Of course, the differences in complexity between these two solutions are stark. An FAQ bot simply needs to identify the user’s goal and produce a relevant answer. A process-oriented bot will typically require integrations to external backend systems. It may need to authenticate the user and be able to access privileged information from one or more sources. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p12"> 
   <p>As you can see, there is often an inherent degree of complexity involved in delivering a solution that can accomplish the more useful tasks offered by virtual assistants. A virtual agent must serve two masters: the end user and the business or organization that created and maintains the solution. Deciding who will absorb the burden or effect of complexity is a balancing act. </p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p14"> 
   <p>Complex transactional conversations can feel intimidating or confusing to a user. Poorly designed flows introduce a proportional amount of friction to the experience. A major liability of unnecessary complexity is that it introduces additional potential failure points. Failures in the conversation will either block the user from progressing or subject them to retries. As a result, users often end up asking for an agent or simply abandoning the chat. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p15"> 
   <p>We saw the effect of unnecessary complexity while working with an insurance company. They had a voice solution for medical providers. Providers could call to obtain status and payment details about submitted claims, but the claim search flow only had a 40% success rate. The flow required five pieces of information from a user before it would search for a claim. Figure 8.1 shows the steps in the claim search.</p>

   <p>We looked for ways to reduce the complexity in this flow. Our research revealed that a majority of callers only had one claim for any particular member and date combination. In other words, a search on that information alone would often produce a single result. This meant that collecting a claim number was unnecessary for most users. </p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p25"> 
   <p>An overly complex user experience can hurt your business metrics across multiple dimensions: user opt-out rates may increase, escalations to support staff could go up, self-serve task completions may decrease, and NPS or user survey scores may go down.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p26"> 
   <p>An example of business impact, again with our insurance company, was an inexplicable, disproportionate number of opt-outs (request for an agent) occurring after a successful claim lookup. After the caller navigated the search process (which involved answering three or four questions), they were presented with a final question: Would they like the claim information read or faxed to them? Figure 8.3 shows a breakdown of the user responses to this question.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p27">

   <h5 class=" figure-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Figure 8.3</span> Callers asked for a representative almost two-thirds of the time. The most logical option—having the information read to the caller (i.e., delivered via the same channel over which they were currently engaged)—was the second most popular choice. Just 1% of users chose the option to receive a fax of the information they sought. </h5>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p28"> 
   <p>At this point in the flow, the solution had successfully identified the user and retrieved the information they were seeking. Unfortunately, users were opting out, not knowing they were <em>so close</em> to successfully completing their goal. This was clearly a problem for the business, as the loss of containment meant that human agents were handling tasks that should have been (and in fact, nearly were) successfully completed by the virtual assistant. The following listing shows the user experience before improvements.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p29"> 
   <h5 class=" listing-container-h5 browsable-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Listing 8.3</span> Caller asks for agent even though claim search was successful</h5>

<strong>CALLER</strong>: Speak to a representative.</pre>  
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p30"> 
   <p>The original design choice for offering two options at this juncture may have seemed sound in theory (the subject matter experts said, “We regularly get requests for faxes”), but the evidence suggested that the caller’s tolerance for complexity had been exceeded. One hypothesis was that the question itself was falsely signaling a complex situation; otherwise, why wouldn’t the bot just read the information? It could also be that the user was frustrated by answering so many questions without getting anything of value in return.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p31"> 
   <p>In this example, the business was affected across multiple dimensions: opt-out rates and escalations increased while self-service task completions correspondingly decreased. The logical solution was to remove this question and simply read the claim details. The offer to also receive a fax was moved to later in the flow—after the claim details were given. Figure 8.4 shows the updated experience and possible outcomes. <span class="aframe-location"/></p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p33"> 
   <p>Eliminating one conversational turn guaranteed that all callers who provided the required claim lookup credentials successfully completed the task flow, as shown in listing 8.4. Once the details are given, the caller can simply hang up if they have everything they need, resulting in full containment of a call. Callers may also choose to receive a fax, in which case, a flow is invoked to complete that task. Some users may still request an agent, but the reasons for requesting an agent at this point are likely different from their reasons for requesting an agent <em>before</em> the claim details were read. (In that case, a <em>new</em> pain point may need to be addressed.)</p>

   <p>As you design your bot—or work to improve an existing one—keep in mind that simple interactions (from the user’s perspective) make it easier to reach a successful outcome. The definition of a “successful” outcome will vary according to the use case and business objectives. With proper planning, however, a solution’s business metrics can be tracked to the strategies used to build or improve a solution. Good metrics will provide guidance for understanding the success rate, usefulness of, and weaknesses in your conversational design. </p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p37"> 
   <p>Reducing complexity for the user can sometimes increase the complexity of the dialogue design. Transactional conversations—those that interact with a user over multiple turns to reach a goal—have multiple failure points and add complexity with each feature or capability that is supported. To ease the pain of complexity for users, conversations must be designed with a maximally natural and thoughtful flow. In other words, the harder your process is, the more effort you should put into reducing complexity for the user to ensure the best chance of a successful outcome.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p38"> 
   <p>Some strategies for reducing complexity for the user are simple and inexpensive to implement, yet deliver high value. Other strategies, especially those requiring integration with backend systems, are more technically complex and/or costly to implement. Each business and use case must assess the value gained versus cost and other tradeoffs when adding robust capabilities like natural language understanding, personalization, and automation to a conversational experience. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p39"> 
   <p>Of course, good metrics—a common theme throughout this book—are key to good planning and prioritization. Is it worth designing for every possibility the bot could encounter? Most certainly not! But there are things you can do to optimize the experience for a majority of users and scenarios. The 80/20 rule is a good starting point for deciding where to invest in improvements or expansion of bot capability. If 80% of users will benefit, it’s probably worth implementing.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p40"> 
   <p>Complexity for the user can be a barrier to success. Designing an effective, simplified conversational exchange requires a thorough understanding of the user, including who they are, what brought them to your virtual assistant, and what they expect to get out of the experience. User research should inform your design. It may not be feasible or cost effective to implement every accommodation. What is worth pursuing, however, is meeting the user where they are and knocking down barriers that impede their path to success wherever possible. </p>

   <p>In a complex flow, each turn, or user response, may take the user down a particular path. Ideally, that path would be the most efficient route to reach an end goal. If the user’s journey is overly complicated or inefficient, there is room for improvement. </p>

  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p51"> Asking the user for information they are unlikely to have, or need time to retrieve </li>

   <li class="readable-text" id="p55"> Choice overload and choices that do not map to a user’s mental model of how to progress toward their goal </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p56"> Asking for information in a disjointed order </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p57"> Asking for information that is not optimal for the interface or channel (e.g., asking for an email address over a voice channel) </li>

   <p>An optimal experience will make good use of what the solution knows about each user at the start of the conversation as well as what it learns about the user along the way. This information is typically stored as context for the conversation. It may come from a backend system or directly from the user over the course of the interaction. By using what you know or have learned about the user, you can personalize the conversation or dynamically route a user along the most efficient path to completion.</p>

   <p>One company we worked with offered a user three options to look up their account: the (13 digit) account number, a social security number, or a phone number.

  <div class="readable-text" id="p71"> 
   <p>The flow of information should match what the user expects from a conversational exchange. Make every effort to provide or request information in the order that a user would naturally expect to receive or convey information. In other words, align to their mental model for storing and retrieving information. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p72"> 
   <p>This applies to your wording choices as well. When your chatbot offers choices, be sure that your terminology maps to what the user understands. Does the user have enough information to choose the best option for their situation?</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p73"> 
   <p>Another way to align with the user’s mental model is to allow them to provide multiple pieces of information in a single turn. This technique is known as <em>slot filling</em>. It allows the user to communicate their need in their own words, which may include important details or specifications. When the dialogue can recognize and store key information, it may allow a user to advance further in a flow, bypassing redundant or unnecessary steps. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p74"> 
   <p>For example, when a user makes a dinner reservation, a system may require the date, the time, the number of people in the dinner party, a name for the reservation, and a contact number. In a conversational solution, a user may say, “I’d like to make a reservation for two this Saturday at 8:00 p.m.” A robust solution will recognize the user’s intent (make a reservation) and detect three of the five required details (aka <em>entities</em>). The solution may skip the steps that ask for date, time, and party size, allowing the user to advance directly to collecting a name and contact number.

   <p>Question-type confusion is a frequent culprit in retries or failures that occur while soliciting information from a user. This happens most often when a multiple-choice question is interpreted as yes/no, and vice versa. The channel often drives your approach to solving this problem. Figure 8.8 demonstrates ways to reduce question-type confusion by using the capabilities available for different channels.</p>

   <p>If you cannot eliminate the ambiguity (particularly on a voice channel, where input selectors such as buttons or dropdown options are not possible), make sure your bot gracefully handles a good faith attempt to provide the response they think the bot is asking for. Rather than retry (which is treated as an error, and may result in escalation), disambiguate to clarify the user’s response. The following listing shows a retry<span class="aframe-location"/> experience, which implies that the user is stuck on a step.</p>

   <p>Another way to streamline a conversation is by handling correctional information when it is provided in response to a confirmation question (typically a question that is asked with the intention of getting a “yes” or “no” response). Let’s say we ask a caller if they want to use the phone number they are calling from (the caller ID) to receive text message updates. The obvious valid responses we would plan for are affirmative (“Yes, use that number”) or negative (“No, don’t use that number”).</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p85"> 
   <p>In a process-oriented flow such as this, an affirmative response will proceed to the next step. A negative response might trigger a flow to collect an alternate number for receiving texts. Anything else would digress and/or retry. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p86"> 
   <p>Let’s consider a third type of information that our bot might receive at this step: users sometimes provide an update or correction to information during a confirmation step instead of “yes” or “no” (“Use this other number instead: 555-867-5309”). The following listing shows how an unexpected response causes a failure, which triggers a retry followed by a data collection step. </p>

   <p>If our bot only expects “yes” or “no” as a response, the logic will fail and trigger a retry. Additionally, the user will have to repeat information that was provided in their initial response.

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p92"> 
   <p>Designing a simplified experience for the end user may require integrations that personalize or expedite a self-service experience. Can you make use of API connections into a customer information database to retrieve information that could shortcut the process or help ensure the successful completion of a task? </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p93"> 
   <p>Let’s return to our insurance company to demonstrate how backend processes can simplify the user’s journey. Member IDs in this system could be nine or eleven digits. Additionally, a nine-digit ID number has a letter at the beginning. Being a phone channel experience, several layers of complexity are involved, including soliciting alphanumeric information over a voice channel, detecting alphanumeric information over a voice channel, and performing a database lookup.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p94"> 
   <p>Soliciting alphanumeric information over a voice channel means the user has to be told to speak their response or instructed to use the dial pad in a complicated way. Detecting alphanumeric information over a voice channel can be error-prone due to the similarity in sounds of several alphabetic characters (“B,” “C,” “D,” “Z,” etc.) as well as the similarity in sounds between numbers and letters (such as “8” and “H”). Figure 8.9 shows the original flow, which had a fairly high failure rate.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p96"> 
   <p>To reduce complexity for the user, we added a backend process that could detect whether the system had received a sufficient number of digits, with or without the preceding alpha character. If just the nine digits were detected, we would add the alpha character for the user (it is the same for all members). More detailed instructions could be provided on a retry. Figure 8.10 shows how the updated backend process allowed for a simpler user question.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p98"> 
   <p>This capability may be expensive to implement, so decisions are often based on the cost/benefit analysis of implementing a given capability. (Do you have metrics that will help measure this?) Adding this type of complexity can provide substantial value, but it also introduces more potential failure points. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p99"> 
   <p>For each potential failure point, design the conversation to gracefully handle it by providing a next-best alternative or a way to route the user back on track. This might include retries (repeating a previous step), allowing the user to try a different path to reach their goal, and escalating to an agent.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p100"> 
   <p>The type of failure may dictate what happens next. For example, if an input requires a ten-digit input but the user only entered nine digits, a retry is appropriate. If a backend system is down (causing API failures), retries will be unproductive. In such scenarios, it might be best to hand off to a human for manual processing. If an account lookup fails when a caller inputs an account number, offer the option to look up by a different method, such as by phone number.</p>
