    cloud native architectures for generative AI, advanced capabilities with Azure
    OpenAI and other Azure services, and the operationalization of generative AI in
    the enterprise, including topics such as LLMOps and responsible AI. In [Chapter 3](ch03.html#implementing_cloud_native_generative_ai_with_azure),
    we even explored detailed technical approaches that leverage different Azure resources,
    with recommendations depending on the project scope and type of company data.

    A bit less known than the *postmortem* (in which we analyze a project after we
    have finished it), the *premortem* is done before starting the project, by assuming
    that it has already failed, and then trying to identify the factors that caused
    the failure. This is a powerful tool for generative AI and any AI project, given
    the complexity and uncertainty of this type of implementation, because it can
    include any technical or business topic as a way to identify potential risks and
    to create a mitigation plan.

    from the basics. A roadmap is a visual way to communicate a plan for achieving
    a goal or outcome, in this case the project implementation. It includes the major
    steps or milestones needed to reach it, and it includes the workstreams we have
    previously discussed as a way to organize all required tasks.

  zh: 这些都是创建项目“活路线图”的关键要素。让我们从基础开始。路线图是一种以视觉方式传达实现目标或结果计划的方法，在这种情况下是项目实施。它包括达到目标所需的主要步骤或里程碑，以及我们之前讨论的工作流，作为组织所有必需任务的方式。
- en: The concept of a “living” asset refers to the ability to evolve it from its
    initial version. This is especially important for AI projects (including generative
    AI), as preliminary roadmaps tend to evolve during the implementation phase due
    to unknowns (e.g., how long we need to try and test different prompts) or unexpected
    events (e.g., limited access to cloud platforms, temporary leaves from team members).
    So you can consider the roadmap a canvas to plan and evolve your implementations
    in a visual, easy-to-read manner, an asset you can use with both technical and
    business/executive stakeholders to regularly discuss plans and progress. [Figure 6-3](#fig_3_visual_roadmap_template_for_ai_and_generative_ai_p)

  zh: “活资产”的概念指的是从其初始版本演变它的能力。这对于AI项目（包括生成式AI）尤为重要，因为初步路线图往往在实施阶段会因未知因素（例如，我们需要尝试和测试不同提示符需要多长时间）或意外事件（例如，对云平台的有限访问，团队成员的临时休假）而演变。因此，你可以将路线图视为一个画布，以视觉、易于阅读的方式规划和演变你的实施，这是一个你可以与技术及业务/高管利益相关者一起定期讨论计划和进度的资产。[图6-3](#fig_3_visual_roadmap_template_for_ai_and_generative_ai_p)

- en: One of the most challenging activities for adopters and related partners (e.g.,
    integrators, consulting firms) is to create realistic scenarios for potential
    usage of generative AI solutions. This is critical for sustainable business cases,
    but also to guarantee there is enough budget for the cloud-related costs (the
    cost structure of Azure OpenAI is well optimized for massive use, but it is still
    linear and depends directly on the number of interactions with the system). The
    challenging part is to imagine how many users will actually leverage the solution,
    and how.

    the number of characters and words a user can write). If we handle the maximum
    length for both questions and answers, we can obtain an average length for each
    interaction (e.g., 250 tokens for a 50-token question with a 200-token answer).
