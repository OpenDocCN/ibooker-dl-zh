    as Copilot for short. It’s the big dog in the AI coding assistant world. People
    even call it a “killer application” of generative AI. This is primarily due to
    its advanced code suggestion, creation, and explanation capabilities, which significantly
    enhance developer productivity. By understanding and predicting coding patterns
    based on context, it not only saves time but also assists in writing more efficient
    and error-free code.

    We’re not stopping there: we’ll also see how Copilot is teaming up with other
    companies with the Copilot Partner Program. This chapter is all about seeing the

    described it in a [blog post](https://oreil.ly/L4JcE) as an “AI pair programmer,”
    designed to speed up developers’ work by assisting them in completing tasks more
    efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Copilot is the result of a partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI. Initially,
    it harnessed a large language model named Codex, a variant of GPT-3 tailored for
    coding. Microsoft enhanced this LLM’s capabilities by integrating a new approach
    known as *fill-in-the-middle* (FIM), which better understands code context. This
    improved the quality of code suggestions and shortened response times. Powered
    by the more advanced GPT-3.5 Turbo, this enhancement led to a noticeable uptick
    in the acceptance rate of code suggestions. To improve security, the tool incorporated
    an AI system to instantly block risky coding patterns, focusing on vulnerabilities
    such as hardcoded credentials and SQL injections.

    like multi-line function suggestions that can make your coding workflow smoother.
    A standout feature is its ability to accelerate test generation, a key factor
    in making sure your code is reliable and solid. Plus, it’s got a feature to screen
    out vulnerable coding patterns. It also prevents any suggestions that might mirror
    public code, ensuring that what you create is unique and original.

    everything from the Copilot for Individuals plan and some extra perks designed
    for businesses. It streamlines license management, which is a big plus for companies
    in handling their subscriptions and access. There’s also a feature for managing
    policies across the organization, helping to ensure uniformity in governance and
    consistency in all projects. A key highlight is its top-notch privacy safeguards,
    which are crucial for keeping sensitive business data secure. Additionally, it
    supports corporate proxies, guaranteeing secure and smooth connectivity throughout
    the company’s network.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This comes with a fee of $39 per month per user. The Enterprise plan’s key feature
    is that it allows for training the system on internal codebases. The Enterprise
    version bumps up the efficiency of developers, because the tool starts giving
    more spot-on code suggestions. It helps push for adopting better practices and
    sticking to security rules. It’s tailored to fit the way developers code internally
    and their favorite APIs, frameworks, and packages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another advantage of the Enterprise version is that you can train it on classic
    languages like COBOL and Fortran. General-purpose LLMs might not be as effective
    with these because there’s a lack of training data from public repositories. Of
    course, they wouldn’t have any clue about proprietary languages specific to your
    company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The GitHub system also strengthens the model for the Enterprise edition by continuously
    scanning a company’s repositories. For instance, it zeroes in on recent pull requests
    and merges as well as thumbs-up and thumbs-down feedback. All this helps to spotlight
    the latest methods and strategies a company is using.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    up and shares the subtle knowledge tucked away in the code. With ongoing training,
    the AI keeps pace with the changing codebase, making its help even more precise
    as time goes on. Still, it’s really important for organizations to handle the
    privacy and intellectual property risks that come with mixing these AI tools into
    their development process.

    10% of large enterprises had started using AI-assisted programming tools. This
    hesitancy is partly due to worries about security and precision. However, with
    the rapid advancements in the technology, it’s expected that more and more businesses
    will start adopting these tools in the near future. In short, the benefits they

- en: Before diving in, let’s set the stage by reviewing some basics about developing
    for hardware systems. It’s a whole different ballgame than building software for
    something like a web app. The key challenge is that developers need to know the
    hardware system inside out. Unlike regular software, which works on all-purpose
    computers, firmware talks directly to the hardware. This demands a kind of precision
    and compatibility that’s much more exacting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This level of precision is critical because mistakes in firmware development
    can lead to some seriously expensive consequences. Just one error might mean a
    financial hit in the millions. And it’s not just about the money—time is a huge
    factor too. Fixing a firmware issue usually involves revisiting the manufacturing
    process, and that can add months to the timeline. Such a delay affects not just
    the release schedule but also how competitive the product is in the market.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Clearly, the “move fast and break things” mindset common in Agile software development
    doesn’t work in this setting. The risks are too big for this approach. That’s
    why firmware developers have to put considerable time and effort into making detailed
    plans and doing extensive testing. This careful approach makes sure the firmware
    is as solid and error-free as it can be before it gets paired with the hardware.

    was a fair amount of understandable skepticism. In a pilot project, AMD created
    a custom version of Copilot for various *hardware description languages* (HDLs)
    like Verilog and SystemVerilog. HDLs are specific types of programming languages
    tailored for outlining the architecture, design, and function of electronic circuits,
    especially the digital logic ones. They’re crucial for modeling and simulating
    electronic systems at different levels of abstraction.

    anticipated. Surprisingly, the style of the code generated by Copilot actually
    aligned more with AMD’s standards than what their own programmers were producing.
    The improvement was so significant that some of the programmers even switched
    from using Vim, a highly customizable text editor, to adopting Visual Studio Code
    as their IDE.

    consisting of horizontal lines and a small x, clears all your chat threads. This
    is important due to the way context works. When you type in a prompt, the LLM
    checks out the conversation history. If your chat’s all over the place topic-wise,
    you might end up with some less-than-helpful answers. That’s why it’s a good idea
    to keep each chat focused on a particular topic and start new chats for new topics.

    logs and data analytics. Developers lean on Splunk to keep an eye on their apps
    and fix problems fast, thanks to its powerful search and report features. Then
    there’s New Relic, which is all about making sure your app runs smoothly. It gives
    you real-time insights and diagnostics, helping you spot and fix performance issues
    and make your app run better for a great user experience. And let’s not forget
    Datadog. It’s a key player for monitoring both your infrastructure and applications.
    With its wide range of integrations, Datadog lets developers gather, mix, and
    show off data from all sorts of places, helping them make smart choices about

    of its key features, including its ability to suggest complex code blocks, its
    solid security measures, its impressive performance, and its ease of use in VS

    needs human guidance, Copilot is definitely a peek into the future of AI-driven
    coding.
