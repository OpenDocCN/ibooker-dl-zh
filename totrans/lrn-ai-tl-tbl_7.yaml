    move on to the other AI tool available in the Tableau platform: Tableau Agent.
    As mentioned in the Preface, Tableau Agent (formerly Einstein Copilot) is an AI
    assistant available to those authoring visualizations or Prep workflows on the
    web. It also works directly with the Tableau Data Catalog feature to generate
    summaries of data assets and content. With Tableau Agent, you can use conversant
    AI to build charts and calculations, receive suggestions on what to analyze, and
    minimize administration time. Let’s dive in.'

    a Tableau+ subscription. Introduced in the summer of 2024, Tableau+ is marketed
    as an enterprise-level solution of the Tableau platform (Tableau Cloud only) with
    premium AI features. This version of the product line includes everything you’re
    accustomed to with a normal Tableau license, plus the inclusion of the Data Management
    and Advanced Management add-ons, access to its eLearning library, an instance
    of Data Cloud, Tableau Agent, additional capabilities for Tableau Pulse, Data
    Connect service, and premium support. Unsurprisingly, this offering comes with
    a hefty new price tag, which is roughly 3x the traditional licensing costs for
    each license type.

    Cloud environment, you’ll be able to use Tableau Agent when authoring visualizations
    on the web. To begin, you’ll want to open a new or existing workbook on Tableau
    Cloud. From there, you’ll see an Einstein icon in the upper-right area of the
    authoring screen, next to the Data Guide icon, as seen in [Figure 7-1](#ch07_figure_1_1732595609819928).

    I had to iterate through several differently worded prompts. Each unsuccessful
    prompt resulted in the AI adding an aggregated version, `SUM(Sales)`, as a filter,
    as opposed to the individual value. The key to getting to this result was the
    very explicit indication of *rows of data*, which provided the context necessary
    to look at the individual Sales values instead of the sum.

    Here are some best practices for working with Tableau Agent while authoring:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Use direct and explicit language
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tableau Agent works best when you use imperative verbs to tell it specifically
    what you want. *Make*, *create*, *build*, *write*, *explain*, and *show me* are
    all great prompt starters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As with all good analysis, it’s best if you hide or exclude unnecessary fields
    in your data. This eliminates the opportunity for the AI to offer suggestions
    based on superfluous information or similarly named fields.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Use Tableau language
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    your prompt. Similarly, use contextual phrases that frequently appear in documentation
    to guide the AI.

  prefs: []

- en: If you’re not exactly sure what visualization or calculation you’re trying to
    create, phrase your prompt in the form of a question. Start with words such as
    *how*, *what*, and *which*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to these basic best practices, don’t be afraid to provide feedback
    on whether the AI output was helpful or not by using the familiar thumbs up/down
    icons. Remember, the LLM doesn’t store or directly learn from your prompt because
    of the Einstein Trust Layer (refer to [Chapter 2](ch02.html#ch02_getting_started_with_tableau_pulse_1732595607647464)),
    so you won’t see an immediate improvement. However, your feedback is likely aggregated
    and used to enhance the overall model.
