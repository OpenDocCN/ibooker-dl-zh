<h1><span class="label">Chapter 8. </span>What’s Next?</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You’ve made it through the breadth of AI tools currently available in Tableau, and you now know how to maximize them to support analytics at your organization. However, that’s just the beginning. The use of AI to enhance productivity and insights is still in its early stages. Therefore, this chapter aims to present my observations and perspectives on what the future might hold. I’ll discuss the future of the Tableau product line, consider the direction AI is going with analytics, and give you a broad overview of the larger AI landscape. Much like Salesforce’s own forward-looking statement cautioning stockholders not to make purchasing decisions based on the content of their technical presentations, don’t bank any key decisions on what’s discussed in this chapter; wait for an official product release before taking action.</p>&#13;

<h1>The Future of Tableau</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau" data-secondary="future of" data-type="indexterm" id="kab200"/>the acquisition of Tableau Software by <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Salesforce" data-type="indexterm" id="id675"/>Salesforce, there’s been an undercurrent of belief that Salesforce will eliminate non-cloud-based products from the Tableau ecosystem. And with the introduction of AI tools, the company has all but solidified this direction. At Salesforce’s annual customer conference, Dreamforce (September 2024), Tableau President and CEO <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Aytay, Ryan" data-type="indexterm" id="id676"/>Ryan Aytay debuted <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Einstein" data-type="indexterm" id="id677"/>Tableau Einstein, which is Tableau code rewritten to function on Salesforce’s (cloud-only) Core platform.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Tableau Einstein is a reimagined Tableau experience that aims to finally allow organizations to access and leverage all their data, where it already resides. It is also described as a full analytics solution, one where data modeling, semantic modeling, metric creation, and visualizations can all reside in a strongly governed environment. The center of this technology is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Data Cloud" data-type="indexterm" id="id678"/>Data Cloud, which offers zero-copy connectivity to all major cloud data warehouse solutions on the market. A new concept announced with Tableau Einstein is the idea <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="workspaces" data-type="indexterm" id="id679"/>of <em>workspaces</em>, a place to organize, collect, govern, and share analytics with the right audiences (both internally and externally). A <span class="keep-together">workspace</span> can be anything from a personal playground to an internal team space to an external marketplace. Tableau Einstein features all the AI tools discussed in this book, packaged in a slightly different way.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Tableau Einstein also brings in a new UI for Tableau. Working in Tableau, Einstein is eerily similar to the tabbed pages and componentized assets you may be familiar with in Salesforce’s other products. And this concept speaks to one of the key messages Tableau has been championing: analytics in the flow of work. With this new UI, the new <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="VizQL" data-type="indexterm" id="id680"/>VizQL Data Service, and a marketplace to share and reuse analytical assets, the next generation of Tableau is aimed at weaving visualizations and data-driven insights into every aspect of a user’s workflow. Although there is still a space for dashboarding, the hyper focus on <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="personalization" data-type="indexterm" id="id681"/>personalization and contextualization points to serving up bite-sized information at just the right time.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>At time of writing, Tableau Einstein has not yet been released. You can watch a video of the Tableau Einstein announcement at the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Dreamforce 2024 Tableau Keynote" data-type="indexterm" id="id682"/>Dreamforce 2024 Tableau Keynote on <a href="https://oreil.ly/6-nxE">Tableau’s website</a>.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Tableau Pulse" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch08_tableau_pulse_1732595610004055">&#13;
<h2>Tableau Pulse</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I’ve <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="future of" data-type="indexterm" id="id683"/>had the benefit of tracking the initial release of Tableau Pulse and subsequent releases during the writing of this book. So to me, it seems fairly clear which direction Tableau Pulse is headed. There’s been a significant amount of progress to ensure that metrics are more integrated into the ecosystem, specifically with the newly announced inclusion of metric definitions in the data catalog feature and the ability to embed metric objects in dashboards.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Additionally, there’s been a recent push to add new functionality like manual goals for metrics, advanced sorting of <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="metrics, Pulse" data-secondary="future functionality of" data-type="indexterm" id="id684"/>metrics, and expanded AI reach between metrics as premium <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau+" data-type="indexterm" id="id685"/>Tableau+ features. As Tableau Pulse continues to evolve, we’ll likely see most additional advanced or new features released as premium-only functionality.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Some big gaps still remain in <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="gaps in" data-type="indexterm" id="id686"/>Tableau Pulse that I am hoping will be filled in. Chief among them is the necessity for all metrics to have a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="time dimension" data-type="indexterm" id="id687"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="time dimension" data-type="indexterm" id="id688"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="metrics, Pulse" data-secondary="time dimension" data-type="indexterm" id="id689"/>time dimension associated with them. While time is very commonly used in analysis, requiring a time dimension within a visualization becomes a limiting factor in many scenarios. I’d like to see the expansion of chart types and for time dimensions to be used as only a filter.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I’d also like to see the functionality of Pulse expand such that separate metrics function off the same time horizons and dimension filters—basically a reimagined version of a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="dashboard interface" data-type="indexterm" id="id690"/>dashboard, where related metrics can all be manipulated based on global filters. Although this is somewhat accomplished in the breakdown section of metrics, expanding the functionality to tune several metrics to the same filtered cut of data seems inevitable to both avoid user confusion and enhance the summarized insights served up. Similarly, it makes sense to start incorporating comparisons and correlations among different metrics as a way to find their hidden relationships.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Though I’m not sure if it’s likely in the very near future, the final aspect I’d like to see enhanced is the ability to customize the look of metrics. Current <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="customization" data-type="indexterm" id="id691"/>customization and styling features are nearly nonexistent. Aside from the ability to include color indicators when the <em>value going up</em> is specified, there isn’t a meaningful way to customize charts with colors, labels, shapes, or amount of detail. In particular, charts displayed on the mobile version can lack specificity to see the range and magnitude of a value, instead favoring the look of a sparkline, which is meant to quickly convey the shape or trend of the data but is not useful for identifying exact values. And if the future involves integrating Pulse metrics into the flow of work, it would follow that they should be seamlessly integrated aesthetically.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Tableau Agent" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch08_tableau_agent_1732595610004114">&#13;
<h2>Tableau Agent</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Tableau <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Agent" data-secondary="future of" data-type="indexterm" id="id692"/>and Salesforce definitely aren’t shying away from the concept of AI assistance anytime soon. In fact, it’s fair to say that they’re doubling down on this concept and envisioning a future where AI acts not only as an assistant, but also autonomously. This aligns with Tableau’s latest branding message of being an “AI-powered analytics platform.” So in the near term, AI assistance offered by Tableau Agent is primed to expand quickly.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>While still in the works, Tableau has already mentioned Tableau Agent for building dashboards. I imagine this to be the creation of multiple charts at the same time based on a prompt that is more analytically oriented (e.g., <em>Make a dashboard for me to track and share quarterly sales performance</em>). Perhaps this feature will eliminate the need to use individual worksheets and instead begin the authoring experience on the dashboard canvas.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Tableau has also mentioned that future versions of Tableau Agent will be able to take on a more consultative role. This means expanding functionality from purely task-oriented assistance to the inclusion of visualization best practices, recommendations on chart types, and potential inclusion of common methods for analyzing certain types of data (like customer data). I’ve also heard mention <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)" data-type="indexterm" id="id693"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)" data-type="indexterm" id="id694"/>of <em>retrieval-augmented generation</em> (RAG). RAG is an enhancement to LLMs that allows model builders to incorporate trusted external sources for more detailed information, particularly when the subject is extremely technical in nature. So, there may be a future where the richness of content created by subject matter experts on the internet is included and served up via Tableau Agent.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I would like to see task-oriented assistance expand much further in capability. Currently, Tableau Agent constructs calculations and moves fields around on the various worksheet shelves but doesn’t offset the tediousness of formatting or designing. Including this type of functionality could really speed up creation and minimize the painstaking task of ensuring uniformity within your charts and dashboards. The simplest example would be the ability to specify a font and hierarchy of font sizes across all elements; that could save a tremendous amount of time and effort.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Other administrative tasks are also poised to use Tableau Agent. Everything on the content management side could benefit from AI performing bulk operations like generating descriptions, tagging content, deleting stale content, surfacing redundant content, specifying user permissions, and more. In a future where governance seems to be a much more prominent theme, giving administrators the ability to perform these types of operations in a no-code way at scale will be invaluable.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Finally, I think we’ll see Tableau Agent expand further into the data-preparation space. Often thought to be the toughest part of analytics, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data preparation" data-type="indexterm" id="id695"/>data preparation includes the task of finding, cleaning, combining, and shaping data sets for use. If Tableau Agent can take language-based requests that would traditionally rely on advanced query or coding capabilities, organizations and analysts will be able to extract more value out of a larger portion of the data they’re capturing.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="AI and Analytics" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch08_ai_and_analytics_1732595610004171">&#13;
<h1>AI and Analytics</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data analytics" data-secondary="future of" data-type="indexterm" id="id696"/>discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_ai_in_the_tableau_platform_1732595607206026">Chapter 1</a>, other analytics and BI platforms appear to be on a similar path as Tableau: relying heavily on AI to improve productivity, reduce the barrier of entry for constructing analytical content, and automate the surfacing of data-driven insights to take action. This means that seasoned analytics professionals are poised to start training, tuning, and policing AI created or assisted content.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Traditional roles of <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data professionals, AI and role of" data-type="indexterm" id="id697"/>data professionals like data engineer, analyst, and data scientist could turn into data aggregator, prompt creator, and model trainer, respectively. As an example, the data engineer may no longer need to rely on their expansive technical knowledge of accessing, ingesting, and organizing data sources, but instead will need to focus on the task of ensuring that AI has access to all the organization’s data. This could involve more intensive governance work and ingesting <em>dark data</em>—that is, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="dark data" data-type="indexterm" id="id698"/>data that isn’t currently utilized in a meaningful way within the organization—to expand AI’s knowledge.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The future analyst may not spend as much time answering questions or building data products for business users, but instead could craft semantic models based on areas of the business and specify guidelines for creating analytical prompts. And finally, the data scientist, who has spent time greenfielding analytical models to solve problems, may lose some of the creativity and innovation that was previously a key component of their role. Instead of ideating on new models themselves, they will likely have to scrutinize, maintain, and refine models served up by AI (or the AI models themselves) and training data as it expands into more facets of business.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>While this future of more access to data and more meaningful analysis sounds idyllic, the path there has pain points that are similar to those that have existed in analytics for the past 20+ years. First and foremost is the rationalization and collecting of all organizational data. This moving target has gone through a massive number of iterations and solutions, from storage solutions like Hadoop to cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, giving the feeling that data projects are perpetually in a state of migration to the latest and greatest platforms. AI will add a new layer to this, hopefully one that will finally see governance, curation, and organization of data mature.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>With the support and assistance that AI can bring to working with data, I’m hopeful it’s only a matter of time before the focus shifts back to utilizing the contents of organizational data instead of being a perpetual game of data systems migration. Similarly, AI will hopefully allow for a real expansion of analytical thinking to the everyday knowledge worker and enable a true increase in taking action based on data. In a sense, I’m talking about getting back to the basics of what analytics is all about: better understanding and informed <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau" data-secondary="future of" data-startref="kab200" data-type="indexterm" id="id699"/>decision making.</p>&#13;

<h1>The Future of AI</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There’s <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="future of" data-type="indexterm" id="id700"/>no doubt in the immediate term that AI is going to continue to expand its reach, particularly in the business world. We’re in a transitional phase right now where, to enhance the effectiveness of AI, more knowledge will have to be poured into the models. Once this phase of consumption matures, we’ll likely begin a phase of refinement and increased AI <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="autonomy, AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id701"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="autonomy in" data-type="indexterm" id="id702"/>autonomy. AI autonomy will mean that low-complexity tasks, interactions, and requests are handled without any human <span class="keep-together">participation</span>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Additionally, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="specialization in models" data-type="indexterm" id="id703"/>specialization will likely increase as AI continues to progress. Much like the app-for-everything culture we have today, there will likely be an AI model for narrowly focused subject areas. Time will tell whether these new models will be built from the ground up or in-house, (much like the custom software solution trend of the early 2000s) or if AI organizations like OpenAI will provide off-the-shelf solutions that can be tuned to meet business needs (while still maintaining data privacy).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="benefits to non-business realm" data-type="indexterm" id="id704"/>nonbusiness realm, the increase in AI should also cause an increase in individual creativity and expression. Content creation, like generative art and video, is already becoming extremely popular, and that trend is poised to expand as social media organizations like Meta and X fold AI assistants into their platforms.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>And finally, with the release of Apple’s first generation of integrated AI tools within its iPhone iOS 18 operating system in the last quarter of 2024, AI assistance in the form of internet searching, personal administrative tasks, and information aggregation will undoubtedly become mainstream.</p>&#13;
