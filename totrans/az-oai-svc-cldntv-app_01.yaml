    us, we can consider the 2020s as the beginning of a new era for modern, more accessible,
    and powerful artificial intelligence.

- en: If you are reading this book, you probably already know that AI is not a new
    concept. It’s been several decades since its first appearance (at least as a concept,
    during a very [famous university conference in the United States](https://oreil.ly/kk-Ey)),
    and we can now say that people from almost all walks of life are beginning to
    understand the potential and considerations of artificial intelligence. After
    several [AI summers and winters](https://oreil.ly/au2B6) and cycles of hype and
    deception, the promise of AI value for companies and individuals is finally here,
    and terms such as generative AI, generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), and
    [large language model (LLM)](https://oreil.ly/8KuvO) are everywhere.

    [Midjourney](https://oreil.ly/ercyb), and the new [Microsoft Copilot](https://oreil.ly/NofXj)
    engine is facilitating the interaction between people and the algorithms. Even
    more, the generative AI wave can be considered a democratizing element for mainstream
    AI adoption, due to its unique value for natural language–based communication.

    observatories, startups, etc. are all talking about generative AI, adopting the
    technologies to improve their services to clients and citizens, analyzing its
    potential, and thinking about future AI regulations.

    capabilities were kept behind the scenes (e.g., face detection and classification
    engines for image repositories, natural language processing and generation [NLP/NLG],
    and speech technologies for personal home assistants). Nowadays, most people are
    aware that behind a GPT type of application, there is a “machine” with AI capabilities
    and power algorithms.'

- en: And what comes after awareness? Plenty of things depending on the involved actor,
    but if we observe the typical patterns from companies and startups, mostly learning
    and understanding the key technology elements, and an unstoppable willingness
    to adopt. That brings us to *enablement*, the key element for adoption. For many
    years, most organizations could not leverage powerful AI-enabled technologies.
    That was a privilege reserved for just a few companies and research centers—a
    bit of an AI aristocracy with important entry barriers for innovation and competition.
    This is changing though, in many ways thanks to cloud computing.

- en: Over the last two decades, public clouds such as Amazon Web Services (AWS),
    Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM, Oracle, and [Microsoft Azure](https://oreil.ly/c5Q1h)
    have enabled companies around the world to obtain infrastructure capabilities
    and, depending on the use case, access to very advanced services. In recent years,
    areas such as big data, AI, and security were the superstars, and the key reasons
    for adopters to move to the cloud and leverage aaS (as-a-service) capabilities,
    along with potential [financial and scalability reasons](https://oreil.ly/oXxPn).

- en: Since 2022, generative AI capabilities have suddenly taken the stage. For example,
    Microsoft Azure incorporated [Azure OpenAI Service](https://oreil.ly/XVU1A), a
    cloud-based platform as a service (PaaS) with enterprise-grade capabilities to
    leverage generative language, code, and image features (more on this later). This
    was the first and most advanced option for AI adopters, with a key competitive
    advantage from OpenAI’s technologies. But you, my avid reader, probably know this
    already. And that’s why you’re here, looking for a way to apply generative AI
    by using pre-built models that can be easily customized and integrated via APIs
    (application programming interfaces) with all the security and moderation advantages
    a company may need.

- en: Now it’s time to dig into how to use Azure OpenAI and other Microsoft services
    to design, build, and integrate cloud native solutions that will solve actual
    business needs, with clear business cases, that will enable you to deliver high-quality
    services to your clients and users. If you are here, you certainly understand
    the cloud advantage, but you need some additional pieces of knowledge and guidance.
    That’s what this book is about—actual AI *democratization* (illustrated in [Figure I-1](#fig-i-1))
    for the whole innovation ecosystem. You are (or will be) part of it. Let’s use
    this book to get you on board.

    (managed services that deliver specific value and interconnect with other applications,
    within an end-to-end AI architecture) related to the implementation of Azure OpenAI–enabled
    applications. This means you will be learning about technical settings, but also
    business-related topics, such as return on investment (ROI) and responsible AI.

    expert interviews in [Chapter 7](ch07.html#exploring_the_big_picture). Generative
    AI and Azure OpenAI are rapidly evolving topics, so I want this book to become
    a living resource for your next professional projects.
