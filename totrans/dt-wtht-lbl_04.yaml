- en: Think of the journey in this book as your workshop, where raw concepts and fundamentals
    are turned into case studies and working solutions using Python. Each concept
    we cover, each algorithm we study, and each case study we solve here is a building
    block, but it’s up to you to put them together in creative ways and implement
    them in your real-life business. This implementation should help you solve business
    problems in ways that are both logical and creative. The algorithms, tools, and
    techniques you are learning will allow you to create functional, powerful solutions—step
    by step.

- en: The true art of machine learning lies not in knowing all the algorithms by heart
    or cramming the deepest of mathematical concepts but in knowing how to approach
    the problem, use the available dataset effectively and efficiently, and finally
    solve problems. You should not ignore the user experience while revealing the
    insights to the end user.

    it is now time to move to slightly more advanced topics. In this part, we’ll dive
    into association rules, advanced clustering, and dimensionality reduction techniques.
