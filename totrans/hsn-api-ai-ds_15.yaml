    But they are closely related, and getting closer all the time. In this chapter,
    you will learn about the ways that AI and APIs overlap, some of the skills you
    should develop, and how to build APIs that are compatible with AI. Then, you will
    set up your Part III portfolio project, which you will use in the remaining chapters.

- en: To begin with, APIs are important data sources—along with databases and files—for
    training AI models. Once a model is trained, a REST API is a common method to
    make it available for users. You will train a machine learning model in [Chapter 13](ch13.html#chapter_13),
    and deploy it with a REST API.

    are deployed using APIs. AI tools such as generative AI, natural language processing,
    and others are often cloud hosted and made available as APIs. You will call an
    Anthropic large language model (LLM) through a REST API in [Chapter 14](ch14.html#chapter_14).

- en: An emerging area of overlap between AI and APIs is calling APIs directly from
    *generative AI* applications, which are built using LLMs and interact with users
    via natural language. One type of these applications is called retrieval augmented
    generation (RAG). In a RAG application, the program calls APIs and other data
    sources and then feeds the retrieved information to the LLM along with the user
    prompt. This helps overcome the knowledge gap, in which an LLM only has information
    that it was trained upon.

- en: Another type of generative AI application uses LLMs to determine what API endpoints
    to use, which we will call *agentic* applications in this book. The LLMs make
    this decision by interpreting definitions from OAS files, Python code, or API
    documentation. You will create agentic AI applications that call APIs in [Chapter 14](ch14.html#chapter_14)
    with LangChain and in [Chapter 15](ch15.html#chapter_15) with ChatGPT.

    it, as Doerrfield recommends? This field is changing rapidly, but here are some
    initial tips that apply to LangChain ([Chapter 14](ch14.html#chapter_14)) and
    ChatGPT ([Chapter 15](ch15.html#chapter_15)).
  id: totrans-11

- en: First, you need to consider whether an API or endpoint is appropriate to use
    with an agentic generative AI application without additional safeguards in place.
    The providers of LLMs provide warnings such as that LLMs should not be used “on
    their own in high-risk situations” (Anthropic Claude 3) and that they “may sometimes
    provide inaccurate information” (Google NotebookLM). ChatGPT’s documentation simply
    admonishes the user to “check important info.”

    to address risks of using LLMs for API calls and performing other business tasks.
    Some potential safeguards include requiring a human to approve tasks recommended
    by LLMs before executing, combining multiple AI agents to review tasks before
    executing, reviewing and filtering inputs and outputs to the models, and reviewing
    logs of the functioning of the system. In addition, foundational practices of
    API management and security are required when LLMs use APIs—just as they are when
    conventional software uses APIs. A key security practice is to restrict the permissions
    provided to systems that include LLMs.

    charge for processing *tokens*, which are chunks of text. The size of these tokens
    differs, but the bottom line is the same: the more data a model processes, the
    greater the cost. In addition to the cost, developers using ChatGPT have found
    that it struggles to perform calculations from very large datasets returned by
    APIs. If you are using a model to perform calculations, limiting the size of the
    data results improves its accuracy.'
  id: totrans-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a few ways to accomplish this. Rather than returning all fields related
    to an entity, return only the critical fields. If an API returns child records
    in a collection (e.g., `product.orders`), exclude these from the results and make
    them available in a separate endpoint. Add parameters, filters, and pagination
    to narrow down the specific records in the API call.

    schemas inside your APIs and defining them in your OAS file, you will help the
    LLM know what to expect in the results. You used Pydantic in the API you created
    in [Part I](part01.html#part_1), which enforced standard schemas and published
    them in your OAS file.

    behavior can be erratic. It may try to perform a scan of every record in the API,
    it may just look at the record identifiers and infer this is the count, or it
    may try something completely different. Providing dedicated endpoints takes some
    of the guesswork out.

    AI is a computer program that can have humanlike conversations and complete humanlike
    tasks. AI includes *expert systems*, which have been around for decades. These
    are complicated rules-based systems that can perform humanlike tasks. Modern AI
    focuses on *machine learning*, in which researchers direct the training of models
    but don’t explicitly program them. Generative AI using LLMs is one major application
    of machine learning.
