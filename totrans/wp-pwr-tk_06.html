<p class="body">In chapter 6 you learned how to choose a strong theme and the basics of layout and design. Here in chapter 7, you’ll dive deeper into design, learning more ways to make your site stand out visually. We’ll explore how to ensure that your site looks contemporary and how to precisely fine-tune the design, beyond what options your theme offers in the Appearance &gt; Customize screen.</p>
<p class="body">And you’ll also see how and when to use AI inpainting and outpainting. Inpainting deletes or replaces an object within the image. Outpainting extends the image, creating new content related to the overall perspective, style, and content in the original.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_3">7.1 Creating a contemporary design</h2>
<p class="body">Site design fashions change over time, much like architecture, art, and other creative endeavors. One gauge of current fashion is how today’s buildings look. And you can sum up much of today’s architecture with one word: <i class="fm-italics">stark</i>.<a id="marker-173"/><a id="idIndexMarker001"/></p>
<p class="body">Western styles throughout history have moved between two extremes: curved (decorative, dynamic, ornate) and linear (rectangular, static, minimalist). We’re currently in a linear period in many of the arts, including the art of website design.</p>
<p class="body">For centuries during the classical age, buildings were characterized by utilitarian simplicity and relatively little ornamentation. Examples include early Egyptian, Persian, and Greco-Roman structures (think Parthenon). For the most part, these buildings feature highly systematic, orderly designs, focusing on proportion, balance, symmetry, and function.</p>
<p class="body">But during a long period from the early Middle Ages up until the mid-20th century, the pendulum swung back the other way, and then got stuck decidedly in a lengthy ornate period. Ornamentation, detail, and complexity reigned for centuries. This lasted through the Gothic, Baroque, Rococo, Victorian, and even th<a id="idTextAnchor003"/>e Art Nouveau and Art Deco periods going into the early 20th century. For centuries, architects favored intricate details and extensive decorative elements. From embellishments such as gargoyles and colorful frescoes and stained-glass windows, to elaborate, even fussy, decorations.</p>
<p class="body">Then, durin<a id="idTextAnchor004"/>g World War II, classical styles returned—this time with severe functionality. Even curves went out of fashion. That’s a simplification, but there’s some truth in it. For the past eight decades, the emphasis has been on linear, unadorned, mainly rectangular shapes. The Sidney Opera House and the curvilinear wonders of architect Frank Gehry are among the few exceptions.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="839" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH07_F01_Mansfield.png" width="900"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 7.1 Victorian homes were subtly colored and often included tubular rooms and other curves, offering varied contours. See the ornate porch posts. Even the chimney isn’t rectangular.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">As you can see when you compare figures 7.1 and 7.2, Victorian houses celebrated elaboration and curvature. Today’s more severe aesthetic rejects not only curves, but often even <i class="fm-italics">color</i>!</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="787" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH07_F02_Mansfield.png" width="1050"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 7.2 The contemporary style called brutalism is an extreme example of the reaction against curves, color, ornament, and basic humanity. Apparently, even trees can’t survive within 200 yards of this.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">So-called <i class="fm-italics">brutalist</i> buildings are popular in some circles. Granted, one benefit is that when you stand in front of such structures, <i class="fm-italics">you</i> automatically become the most beautiful, most alive thing in the picture.</p>
<p class="body">Reports say that Beyoncé and Jay-Z paid $200 million cash for their 30,000-square-foot brutalist home in Malibu. It’s the most expensive house ever sold in California.</p>
<p class="body">But no trend is ever absolute. There are, of course, always rebels; bless them. As you can see in the powerful works of Frank Gehry (see Midjourney’s attempt at creating his style in figure 7.3), he’s an architect who is opposed to right angles. (His latest Toronto structures are a touch boxy, but in a predictably weird way.) Even Gehry’s <a id="idTextAnchor005"/>semi-rectangular works seem somehow biological and alive.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="840" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH07_F03_Mansfield.png" width="840"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 7.3 This is Midjourney’s invention of a new building in the style of Frank Gehry. This architecture is at the opposite end of the spectrum from brutalism. And before computers, such a design would have been impossible to blueprint. Brutalism by contrast has been around since the 1930s, primarily in Nazi Germany and Communist Russia, societies not known for their sensitivity to aesthetics.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">Certainly, you won’t want your site to go full-bore brutal, or totally Gehry for that matter. Some sites, bridal sales, for example, can benefit from lacey, ornate, curvaceous design elements, including script fonts that imitate the flourish of traditional calligraphy, as if written with a pen or brush.</p>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-174"/>However, modern site design is clean, uncluttered, and often minimalist. See what you think of the following sites:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">

<p class="body">Notice several things in that third site. The animation is subtle, gentle, and compelling. Also, there’s a very understated olive tree pattern in the background. This animation and opacity can be accomplished by using cascading style sheets (CSS), a powerful design tool. We’ll take a close and extensive look at how to use it next.<a id="idIndexMarker002"/></p>
<p class="body">For a brief, but impressive, preview, let’s ask AI to write some CSS code that we can copy and paste into our site’s Appearance &gt; Customize &gt; Additional CSS screen:</p>

<p class="body">Try it if you wish. Just copy and paste that CSS code into your Appearance &gt; Customize &gt; CSS screen. Click the Publish button, and then go to the frontend of your site. You should see any h1 headings (the largest headings) fade into view. You can adjust the fade-in animation value from 1 second to other durations to change the speed of the animation. You can also play around with the opacity. Start with a value higher than 0 if you want to start with gray rather than completely invisible text. Your site’s title might be an h1 heading. <a id="idIndexMarker003"/><a id="marker-176"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_4">7.2 Understanding CSS styling</h2>
<p class="body"><i class="fm-italics">Cascading style sheets</i> (CSS) is a specialized computer language that can modify most elements of web page design. So, if you want to fine-tune your theme’s default design choices, you need to use CSS.<a id="idIndexMarker004"/><a id="idIndexMarker005"/></p>
<p class="body">The good news is that there’s an excellent plugin named YellowPencil that automatically generates CSS code for you! So, you don’t need to learn the language. And, of course, AI is an excellent programmer as well, as that previous fade-in animation CSS code demonstrates.</p>
<p class="body">With the YellowPencil plugin, you work on a high level—moving sliders, clicking within a color wheel, selecting from a menu, using visual drag and drop, and so on. And all of those adjustments and many more are displayed in real time in a what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) screen. You see the results as you adjust things. Best of all, the YellowPencil plugin <i class="fm-italics">automatically</i> writes the CSS code to make your changes permanent in your website.<a id="marker-177"/><a id="idIndexMarker006"/></p>
<p class="body">We’ll explore the excellent YellowPencil design system shortly in section 7.4. Skip down to it now if you want. This next section is a bit technical, and if you prefer not to read it, no harm done. But if you’re curious, here’s a brief tour of what CSS does and how it works. This book is designed to be of value to beginners, but also of interest to us nerds.</p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">
<p class="fm-sidebar-title">Lowercase always</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Always use lowercase letters when writing CSS and HTML code. Originally, CSS was wisely case-insensitive. But committees got together, and the result was that CSS was made case-sensitive, unfortunately. So, there are now exceptions to case-insensitivity in both HTML and CSS. The code is case-sensitive in several contexts (class names, attribute selectors), but it’s frequent enough to cause countless bugs. So, to avoid problems, <i class="fm-italics">always use lowercase rather than trying to memorize</i> the random exceptions to the rule.<a id="idIndexMarker007"/></p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Here’s an example of CSS style definitions for a CSS class name <code class="fm-code-in-text">myId</code> or <code class="fm-code-in-text">myid</code>:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">#myId {
    color: red;
}
#myid {
    color: blue;
}</pre>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Here’s the HTML:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;div id="myId"&gt;Some text.&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Because of case-sensitivity, the text inside these <code class="fm-code-in-text">div</code> tags is displayed in red, not blue. Why? Because the “i” in <code class="fm-code-in-text">myid</code> is lowercase, and it’s uppercase in <code class="fm-code-in-text">myId</code>. So, CSS sees them as two different CSS selectors.<a id="idIndexMarker008"/></p>
</div>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Definition</span> A <i class="fm-italics">selector</i> is just the name of the design element that CSS is modifying. The selector is followed by a list of one or more property/value pairs. That entire grouping under each selector is called a CSS <i class="fm-italics">rule</i>. Often, the selector is just an ordinary HTML element such as <code class="fm-code-in-text">h1</code>. Or it can be a class name such as <code class="fm-code-in-text">myid</code> in the previous example. <a id="idIndexMarker009"/><a id="idIndexMarker010"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_5">7.2.1 Exploring the role that HTML plays in page design</h3>
<p class="body">Before CSS came along, there was only HTML to tell a browser how a web page should look. But HTML is primarily a <i class="fm-italics">markup language</i> because it marks the beginning and ending of a particular element in a web page, such as a heading or a paragraph:<a id="idIndexMarker011"/><a id="idIndexMarker012"/><a id="idIndexMarker013"/><a id="idIndexMarker014"/><a id="marker-178"/></p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;h1&gt;MAJOR HEADLINE&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
<p class="body">That <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;h1&gt;</code> HTML start “tag” tells the browser to start here applying the h1 style to this text. And the <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;/h1&gt;</code> end tag tells the browser to end that heading style here.</p>
<p class="body">Browsers have a set of default HTML property values. For example, if the browser sees some text surrounded by those <code class="fm-code-in-text">h1</code> tags, it uses the following list of property values by default when displaying the heading:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><code class="fm-code-in-text">display:</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">block;</code>—This means that an h1 heading starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (that’s what the CSS value called <code class="fm-code-in-text">block</code> does).</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><code class="fm-code-in-text">font-size:</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">2em;</code>—The font size of the h1 element is twice the size of the root element’s font size (aka <code class="fm-code-in-text">em</code>).</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><code class="fm-code-in-text">margin-top:</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">0.67em;</code>—The space above the h1 element is 0.67 times the size of the root element’s font size.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><code class="fm-code-in-text">margin-bottom:</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">0.67em;</code>—The space below the h1 element is 0.67 times the size of the root element’s font size.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><code class="fm-code-in-text">margin-left:</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">0;</code>—There is no space to the left of the h1 element.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><code class="fm-code-in-text">margin-right:</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">0;</code>—There is no space to the right of the h1 element.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><code class="fm-code-in-text">font-weight:</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">bold;</code>—The text of the headings is boldface.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">In other words, all h1 headings in a site are rendered using these default design properties. These bulleted items are what CSS calls <i class="fm-italics">property-value pairs,</i> also known as <i class="fm-italics">declarations</i>. The whole point is that you can use CSS to modify any of those default values.<a id="idIndexMarker015"/><a id="idIndexMarker016"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_6">7.2.2 Looking at what CSS brings to HTML</h3>
<p class="body">What if you wanted to change the size, font, color or other properties of the h1 headings on your site? In other words, you wanted to modify those default browser declarations. Maybe you want to make these headings larger or something. Before CSS, you would have had to go through all the site’s HTML code and change <i class="fm-italics">each</i> h1 element by hand. (In HTML, a complete tag-content-end tag unit is called an <i class="fm-italics">element</i>.) To make the h1 headings larger, you would have to retype the HTML start tag to read like this:<a id="idIndexMarker017"/><a id="idIndexMarker018"/><a id="idIndexMarker019"/><a id="idIndexMarker020"/></p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;font size="+2"&gt;MAJOR HEADLINE&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
<p class="body">This says make the h1 headings two sizes larger than the browser’s default size. Typing in this change to every h1 heading throughout a site was obviously both cumbersome and tedious.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Warning</span> Be sure that any quotation marks are straight (" "), not curly (“ ”), in your CSS code. HTML and some types of CSS code don’t like slanted or curly open and close quotation marks. <a id="idIndexMarker021"/></p>
<p class="body">Here are some typical HTML tags:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;h6&gt;</code> define headings, with <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;h1&gt;</code> being the most important and <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;h6&gt;</code> the least (usually the smallest). These give a hierarchical structure to the text content on your site, letting readers know the relative importance of, or the relationship between, sections in the page.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;p&gt;</code> represents paragraphs (common body text).</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;span&gt;</code> specify a zone or a group of page components.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;table&gt;</code> is used for tables.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;img&gt;</code> is used for images.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;a&gt;</code> is used for hyperlinks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_7">7.2.3 Enter CSS</h3>
<p class="body">Fortunately, CSS was invented to make site design far easier and more varied. Among other helpful features, you can change all the h1 headings in a site by modifying just <i class="fm-italics">a single CSS rule</i>. (We did this in the fade-in CSS example earlier.) This next example shows a rule that makes all h1 headings twice the size of the browser’s default (2 em) font size):<a id="idIndexMarker022"/><a id="marker-179"/></p>
<pre class="programlisting">h1 {
    font-size: 4em;
}</pre>
<p class="body">In most modern browsers, the size of the paragraph <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;p&gt;</code> body text elements defaults to 16 pixels [px]).</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> The <i class="fm-italics">pixel</i> is the smallest visual unit in a display such as a TV or cellphone. If you get up real close to a TV, you can usually see the pixels, that is, little dots. You can’t see them on a cellphone screen because they are too small, but on a jumbotron display in a stadium, its pixels are the size of bricks. So, the size of a pixel is relative to the size of the screen that it’s on. A pixel doesn’t have a specific, absolute size like an inch or centimeter.<a id="idIndexMarker023"/></p>
<p class="body">CSS also offers many more style properties than were available in the original HTML set of attributes (<i class="fm-italics">attribute</i> is HTML’s name for styling modifications). And CSS even goes beyond simple styling. Some prefer to call CSS a markup language, but it’s actually a design language with significant capabilities in addition to markup (merely specifying the start and end of a style). For example, CSS includes the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Transforms</i>—2D or 3D transformations applied to an HTML element, allowing you to rotate, scale, move, skew, reposition, and make other changes to the elements.<a id="idIndexMarker024"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Transitions</i>—Morphing an element from one state to another. In other words, CSS transitions allow you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration, at a given speed, and starting after a given delay. This technique can be used to create a variety of effects and animations such as fading in or out, scaling, skewing, changing colors, and rotating an element over time.<a id="idIndexMarker025"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Layout and positioning</i>—<i class="fm-italics">Flex</i> is a model for positioning and aligning elemen<a id="idTextAnchor006"/>ts within a container. CSS Flex specifies how an element grows or shrinks to fit the space available within its <code class="fm-code-in-text">Flex</code> container. Three properties—<code class="fm-code-in-text">flex-grow</code>, <code class="fm-code-in-text">flex-shrink</code>, and <code class="fm-code-in-text">flex-basis</code>—work together, giving you an efficient way to align, lay out, and distribute space among elements within a <code class="fm-code-in-text">Flex</code> container.<a id="idIndexMarker026"/><a id="idIndexMarker027"/><a id="idIndexMarker028"/><a id="idIndexMarker029"/><a id="idIndexMarker030"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Shadowing</i>—Text or frame shadow effects.<a id="idIndexMarker031"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Special text specifications</i>—Specs such as adjusting line height.<a id="idIndexMarker032"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_8">7.2.4 What is the cascade?</h3>
<p class="body">This colorful term <i class="fm-italics">cascade</i> is pretty accurate. CSS is called cascading style <i class="fm-italics">sheets</i> (plural) because there can be more than one CSS style sheet. There are four main style sheets (files that hold CSS code), and they, working together, create the cascade. <a id="idIndexMarker033"/><a id="marker-180"/><a id="idIndexMarker034"/></p>
<p class="body">This means there can be duplicated CSS properties in the sheets. Let’s say that one style sheet specifies that h1 headings should be red, but another style sheet says they must be green. What’s a poor browser to do? The answer is that there is an order (the “cascade”) to style sheets. The browser must use the color mentioned in the <i class="fm-italics">lowest</i> style sheet (or the lowest mention within a single style sheet).</p>
<p class="body">The cascade is confusing at first. Here’s how to visualize this cascade process. Let’s consider two CSS <code class="fm-code-in-text">h1</code> selectors that are in the same style sheet. One of them is below the other in the style sheet, thus it’s the lowest one. This CSS code results in blue h1 headings because the <code class="fm-code-in-text">blue</code> value is listed lower than <code class="fm-code-in-text">red</code>:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">h1 {
    color: red;
}
h1 {
    color: blue;
}</pre>
<p class="body">Put another way, if a CSS property repeats, then the property value (such as the color) lowest in the code is used, and any other previous duplicate property definition (higher in the code) is just ignored. Those previous values are said to be <i class="fm-italics">overruled</i>. Just the way that a school principal can overrule a teacher.<a id="idIndexMarker035"/></p>
<p class="body">To better understand what “lower” means in this context, it helps to visualize a cascade of water, falling down a hill. When deciding which duplicated declaration to use, the browser looks at all four style sheets in a specific order. This is the <i class="fm-italics">cascade</i>, as described here:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">There are four main outcroppings in the CSS cascade, and at each one, if any CSS selector’s property-value pair declaration is repeated, then any previous such declarations are overruled.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Visualize a water cascade with four drops or outcroppings. A basket of flowers is placed in the water at the highest outcropping. The flowers are arranged in a particular order. But then the basket falls down to the second outcropping pool, and the flowers might be rearranged by that bump. Then, it bumps down the third and fourth outcroppings, and comes to rest in the lowest pool. If a CSS declaration (property-value pair for a particular selector) is redefined during any of these bumps, that new redefinition is the one used, the one that “wins.” In other words, each lower outcropping in the cascade can redefine (overrule and change) any CSS style that was previously defined by an earlier outcropping.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">If outcropping 3 says h1 is red, but outcropping 4 says green—green wins and the browser follows that rule when displaying the h1 headings on the site. Each lower outcropping can redefine any selector’s property value, so the lowest outcropping that mentions the color of the h1 heading is the color that the browser ends up displaying. Figure 7.4 illustrates how a cascade works.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_9">7.2.5 The order of the style sheets in the cascade</h3>
<p class="body">As mentioned earlier, there are four main sheets in CSS. Here is the cascade of sheets in order, starting from the highest to the lowest style sheets:<a id="idIndexMarker036"/><a id="marker-182"/><a id="idIndexMarker037"/></p>
<p class="body-dialog">   1.  The first, highest outcropping is the browser’s default styles. All other subsequent, lower outcroppings can overrule these default style definitions. For example, browsers default to the color black for h1 headings. This is the baseline, and if no subsequent style sheets later in the cascade mention h1’s color, then h1 is rendered black by the browser. (And this is pretty common given that black on white text is usual on sites.)</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   2.  Each WordPress website has a theme, and each theme has its own CSS style sheet. It’s the cascade’s <i class="fm-italics">second</i> outcropping. You can look at it in your WordPress backend by going to the Appearance &gt; Theme File Editor screen. The theme’s style sheet overrules the browser defaults (but can be overruled by the next two outcropping drops).</p>
<p class="fm-calloute"><span class="fm-callout-head">Warning</span> You can look at the theme’s style sheet if you wish, but don’t modify it or any of the theme’s other code files.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   3.  <i class="fm-italics">Your</i> (the site administrator’s) CSS style specifications come next. In your Appearance &gt; Customize &gt; Additional CSS screen, <i class="fm-italics">you</i> can type in CSS code that overrules the previous two style sheets (browser’s defaults and theme’s). This is the third outcropping.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   4.  Finally, at the lowest level, is what’s called <i class="fm-italics">inline CSS.</i> It overrules those previous three style sheets. Inline CSS is different from the other levels. Those first three style sheets are <i class="fm-italics">global</i>—their style definitions are applied to all elements (like <i class="fm-italics">all</i> the h1 headings) throughout the entire site.<a id="idIndexMarker038"/></p>
<p class="body-ind">However, inline CSS is <i class="fm-italics">local</i> and thus defines styles for only a particular zone. That zone can be as small as a single character. Or it could be a word, sentence, paragraph, entire page, heading, image, or some other local content area. One way to specify the zone is to enclose something between <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</code> or <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code> tags, like this:<a id="idIndexMarker039"/></p>
<pre class="programlistinge">&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;This sentence is red&lt;/span&gt; </pre>
<p class="body-ind">In the classic WordPress editor, inline CSS code goes into a Text tab on the page’s Edit Page screen. Or for the Gutenberg block editor (when using a Paragraph block or similar block), click the three dots (Options) in the upper-right corner of an Edit Page screen. Then, click Code Editor, or press Ctrl-Shift-Alt-M.</p>
<p class="body-ind">Here’s the inline CSS code that makes a single sentence red:</p>
<pre class="programlistinge">&lt;p style="color: red;"&gt;This is a red sentence.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
<p class="body-ind">This part is the actual CSS code:</p>

<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> Pay attention to those <code class="fm-code-in-text">{ }</code> brackets in CSS code. Leave one out, and the code won’t work.

<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Note</span> Technically, there are some additional style sheets beyond the four we’ve looked at.

<p class="body">Now let’s take a look at a tool called the Inspector, which is built into most browsers. It has several useful features, among which are displaying any website’s HTML and CSS code side by side. But, in addition to that, you can also use the Inspector for the following:<a id="idIndexMarker040"/></p>

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_10">7.3 Using the Inspector</h2>
<p class="body">Let’s take a look at some real-life CSS examples and a set of tools you might find useful when exploring CSS and HTML. These tools ca<a id="idTextAnchor007"/>n be found in your browser’s Inspector (aka Dev Tools). While viewing any web page, you open the Inspector by right-clicking to open the context menu, and then click Inspect from the menu. Figure 7.6 shows a typical Inspector display.<a id="idIndexMarker049"/><a id="idIndexMarker050"/><a id="idIndexMarker051"/><a id="marker-184"/></p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="463" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH07_F06_Mansfield.png" width="1100"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 7.6 Here you can see quite a few details about this web page.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">The pane on the left shows the HTML code, and the pane on the right shows the CSS code. Double-click an HTML element in the HTML pane to select it (in figure 7.6, a <code class="fm-code-in-text">div</code> zone has been selected), and you can see any associated CSS code in the right pane.</p>
<p class="body">Notice that the CSS property <code class="fm-code-in-text">webkit box sizing</code> has a line through it. This means that the same property reappears lower in the cascade, so its value here (<code class="fm-code-in-text">content-box</code>) is going to be ignored when the browser renders this code. It’s been overruled. <a id="idIndexMarker052"/></p>
<p class="body">The Inspector has many features and tools. For one thing, you can usually find out what theme and plugins a site is using. Press Ctrl-F, and search for theme.</p>
<p class="body">This feature-rich toolset lets you inspect, debug, and test CSS. The Inspector provides an intuitive and interactive interface to help you understand and manipulate the visual aspects of any page.</p>
<p class="body">The styles pane on the right shows the CSS <i class="fm-italics">rules</i> applied to the currently selected HTML element. That feature lets you understand why a certain style is being applied or overridden.<a id="idIndexMarker053"/></p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">
<p class="fm-sidebar-title">Rules and selectors</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Recall that a CSS rule is the entire list of properties and their values for a particular HTML element. The rule starts with what’s called the <i class="fm-italics">selector</i> (that’s what CSS calls the HTML element being styled). The selector is followed by an open curly brace (<code class="fm-code-in-text">{</code>) and the list of property:value pairs. Finally, the rule ends with a close curly brace (<code class="fm-code-in-text">}</code>). Here’s a typical CSS rule:<a id="marker-185"/><a id="idIndexMarker054"/></p>
<pre class="programlisting">h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-family: sans-serif;
    font-size: 14em;
    f<a id="idTextAnchor008"/>ont-weight: bold;
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="body">The Inspector also lets you live-edit the CSS code. Any changes made in the Styles pane are immediately reflected on the Inspector’s web page pane. (The page was displayed previously with the two code panes, though the panes can be resized and reordered.) This way, you can experiment with different CSS styles and see the results instantly, without needing to edit the source files and refresh the page.</p>
<p class="body">You can edit existing rules, disable rules, add new rules, and even add entirely new style sheets. (To see more of the frontend pane, move your mouse just above Performance on the menu, and then drag down.) Any changes you make in the Inspector aren’t permanent, however. You’re just experimenting, but the changes aren’t applied to any style sheets.</p>
<p class="body">The Inspector also includes various tools for working with more complex CSS features. For example, the box model view shows the padding, border, and margin for the selected element, and allows these values to be edited directly. (To see the box model for the selected element, click the Computed tab above the CSS code.) Below the box illustration, you can see the final result of the cascade as it applies to this element. In other words, you can see which values won out after the cascade is finished. This can be useful for understanding complex style interactions. (<i class="fm-italics">Computed</i> here means the final result after the entire cascade has been scanned and rendered.)</p>
<p class="body">The most popular browsers’ Inspectors also include tools for working with CSS animations and transitions. You can view and control the timeline of animations, slow them down, and pause them at specific points. This can be a help when debugging animations. The various browsers’ Inspectors differ a bit in what they can do, so here’s an overview of each:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Chrome</i>—Chrome’s Inspector includes an Animations Drawer tab that automatically detects and groups animations. You can then inspect animations, slow down or replay them, and see the source code.<a id="idIndexMarker055"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Edge</i>—The Animation Inspector in Edge’s Animations tool supports CSS animations and transitions. You can manipulate and test various effects, i<a id="idTextAnchor009"/>ncluding changing the timing, delay, duration, or keyframe offsets.<a id="idIndexMarker056"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Firefox</i>—Firefox’s Page Inspector includes an animations view that displays animations in the page synchronized along a timeline. It supports animations created using CSS transitions or keyframes rules.<a id="idIndexMarker057"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Safari</i>—Safari’s Web Inspector provides a graphics feature that enables previewing keyframes and their classes from CSS animations and transitions.<a id="idIndexMarker058"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">The Inspectors also include tools for responsive design testing. You can simulate different screen sizes, resolutions, and even specific devices, allowing you to see how your CSS styles look on various screen’s sizes and shapes.</p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">
<p class="fm-sidebar-title">Simplifying animation with keyframes</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">A <i class="fm-italics">keyframe</i> is an important moment of change (or “beat”) in an animation sequence. A keyframe can specify when something begins to move, changes direction, resizes, and so on. Keyframes can be set for things such as position, rotation, scale, and so on. Between two keyframes (or a keyframe and the end of the sequence), the animation software will automatically interpolate the values to create smooth transitions.<a id="idIndexMarker059"/><a id="idIndexMarker060"/><a id="idIndexMarker061"/><a id="marker-186"/><a id="idIndexMarker062"/></p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">This means you don’t have to manually define every tiny change, just the important keyframes. You can just say, rotate for 1 second, rather than specifying each position for every one of, say, 24 frames per second. You use this shorthand keyframe technique to specify timing, pacing, transformations, and other animation effects. <a id="idIndexMarker063"/><a id="idIndexMarker064"/><a id="idIndexMarker065"/></p>

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_11">7.4 Mastering YellowPencil</h2>
<p class="body">The YellowPencil plugin is amazing. It allows anyone to build a highly customized site that very closely aligns visually with their site’s purpose. And, you don’t need to know a single thing about CSS. You can fine-tune the design elements of your pages (tastefully, within reason). What’s more, your site won’t look like a clone of other sites using the theme you installed.<a id="idIndexMarker066"/><a id="marker-187"/><a id="idIndexMarker067"/></p>
<p class="body">If you don’t feel comfortable fine-tuning your site, turn someone with design experience loose on the site for a few days. And give them YellowPencil. With that plugin, as mentioned, a designer doesn’t need to know anything about computer programming in general or CSS in particular. Yet they can have YellowPencil generate complex and powerful CSS code to really make the site shine. Of the several CSS code generator plugins, YellowPencil is the most popular.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> YellowPencil has dozens of tools and features. You can read about them here: <a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/QDg1">https://mng.bz/QDg1</a>.</p>
<p class="body">To get started with YellowPencil, go to your Plugins &gt; Add New screen in WordPress, and search for <code class="fm-code-in-text">Visual CSS Style Editor</code> (YellowPencil’s official name). Install and activate it. When you view the YellowPencil screen, click the Resources tab shown in figure 7.7 to see where to go for tutorials and forums where you can get answers from experts.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="477" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH07_F07_Mansfield.png" width="940"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 7.7 If you run into any problems when using YellowPencil, these are great resources to find answers.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">YellowPencil doesn’t modify your theme’s CSS file, nor does it put its CSS code in your Appearance &gt; Customize &gt; Additional CSS screen (which is where <i class="fm-italics">you</i> can add CSS code you write yourself, or have AI write for you). Instead, the CSS that YellowPencil generates can be viewed and edited by going to the YellowPencil &gt; Customizations screen in the backend of your WordPress site. But this feature is only available in the Pr<a id="idTextAnchor010"/>o version of the plugin.</p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">
<p class="fm-sidebar-title">YellowPencil: Free vs. pro versions</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">The Pro version of YellowPencil automatically saves its CSS code to your WordPress site (in a YellowPencil &gt; Customizations screen). The free version saves only some of the CSS properties. Also, the Pro version includes many additional features not available in the free version. Going pro is quite inexpensive considering all the capabilities you get. <a id="idIndexMarker068"/><a id="idIndexMarker069"/></p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">However, you can generate usable CSS code (even for the CSS properties labeled Pro in the YellowPencil editor) while just using the free version. The reason is that the free YellowPencil does at least display any CSS it generates. But adding CSS code to your site by hand is inconvenient and prone to typos.</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Free YellowPencil won’t allow you to use Ctrl-C to copy their code. You can, however, write the code down on a piece of paper, type it into Notepad, or just take a screenshot of it. Then, go to your site’s Appearance &gt; Customize &gt; Additional CSS screen, and type the code into that screen. How to do this is described next.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_12">7.4.1 Automatically generating CSS code</h3>
<p class="body">We’ll now give YellowPencil a try. Let’s generate some simple CSS code to make a page title on one of your site’s pages larger and colored blue. Go to your Pages &gt; Add New screen, and add a new page titled <code class="fm-code-in-text">Practice</code><i class="fm-italics">.</i> Then, click the Publish or Update button to store that page. <a id="idIndexMarker070"/><a id="idIndexMarker071"/><a id="marker-188"/><a id="idIndexMarker072"/></p>
<p class="body">In the upper-right corner of the Practice page’s Edit Page screen, click the Edit Page – YellowPencil button. This takes you to the main YellowPencil screen, shown in figure 7.8. Notice that on the right side of figure 7.8 is a list of CSS design categories you can modify. Click the Text property to open and view all the typography properties you can modify.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 7.8 When you click an element in the page, you can style it in the right panel. Here, we’re going to work with the title of the page.<a id="marker-189"/></p>
</div>
<p class="body">Now, click the black Color bar, and then click blue (see it under the Color category in figure 7.9). Drag the Font Size up to 60 px. Notice that these changes are immediately displayed in YellowPencil’s page view. This way, you can make adjustments and check the effect the changes have on the overall design of the page, as shown in figure 7.9.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 7.9 Modifications you make in the right panel are displayed in real time on the page view to the left.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">Notice the Pro icon next to Font Family and Color. This means you can change these properties in YellowPencil, but if you haven’t signed up for the Pro version, YellowPencil won’t apply them to your site. Changes to the other properties, such as Style Italic, <i class="fm-italics">will</i> be applied and saved to the YellowPencil &gt; Customizations screen on your site, as shown in figure 7.10.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 7.10 This WordPress backend YellowPencil &gt; Customizations screen shows CSS code for the modifications that you’ve made in YellowPencil.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">But let’s assume you do want to make those Pro changes, such as turning the page title blue and boosting it to 60 px large. However, you don’t have the Pro version. You can still use this code to make those changes, even in the free version, though it’s somewhat clumsy. Click the CSS Editor icon on the left side (or press <code class="fm-code-in-text">E</code>), and you can then see the CSS code for the Pro color and font-size properties, as shown in figure 7.11. Figure 7.12 then displays CSS code you can use on your site.</p>

</div>
<p class="body">You can copy this CSS code by hand (or take a screenshot of it), go to your site’s Appearance &gt; Customize &gt;Additional CSS screen, and then type or paste the code into the CSS field. The heading is now larger and blue. But if you plan to do a lot of CSS work, YellowPencil’s price for the Pro version is quite reasonable.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_13">7.4.2 Understanding CSS animation</h3>
<p class="body">Currently, YellowPencil offers the following animation features:<a id="idIndexMarker073"/><a id="idIndexMarker074"/><a id="idIndexMarker075"/><a id="marker-190"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">

<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Animations and transitions are related. However, <i class="fm-italics">animation</i> is more complex and versatile. You can use multiple keyframes and continuously play or loop the activity without requiring user interaction or other triggers. Animation can involve multiple properties and allow fine control over timing and sequencing, displaying more complicated and varied movement and effects. <a id="idIndexMarker079"/><a id="idIndexMarker080"/><a id="marker-191"/></p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text"><i class="fm-italics">Transitions</i>, by contrast, are typically used for simple interactions involving a change from one state to another (such as invisible to visible, or black to pink). They are triggered by user interaction (such as viewing a new page) and typically involve a smooth change of one or more CSS properties between two states: the initial state and the final state. An example is changi<a id="idTextAnchor011"/>ng black normal text to pink italics, and back again. To sum up: the Animation Generator tool is <a id="idTextAnchor012"/>used for creating more complex, keyframe-based animations, while the transitions tool creates simpler, state-based effects.</p>

<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> Here’s a good tutorial from MDN Web Docs on the many ways you can animate your pages using CSS: <a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/yW27">https://mng.bz/yW27</a>.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_14">7.4.3 Try animating</h3>
<p class="body">Here are the steps you can take to fade something in. This can be a subtle, but effective, way to display various elements such as your site’s tagline underneath the site title. Visitors will see your site’s title right away, but then your tagline will take a few seconds to fade into view.<a id="idIndexMarker089"/><a id="marker-192"/><a id="idIndexMarker090"/></p>
<p class="body">In this example, we’ll make the site’s h1 headings take 2 seconds to fade into view using the YellowPencil plugin’s Motion feature:</p>
<ol class="calibre7">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Go to your Pages &gt; All Pages screen, and then click a page named Practice to open its Edit Page screen.</p>

</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Leave the <code class="fm-code-in-text">`Delay`</code> property at its default <code class="fm-code-in-text">0</code> value unless you want the animation to start sometime after the page displays.<a id="idIndexMarker095"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Set the <code class="fm-code-in-text">`Easing`</code> property to <code class="fm-code-in-text">`ease`</code> or <code class="fm-code-in-text">`linear`</code> depending on how you want the speed of the animation to vary over its duration.<a id="idIndexMarker096"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Set the <code class="fm-code-in-text">`Animation Fill Mode`</code> to <code class="fm-code-in-text">`forwards`</code> to ensure that the page title element remains visible after the animation ends.<a id="idIndexMarker097"/></p>

<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Click the Save button in the upper-right area to store the code on your website.</p>

<p class="body">Now return to your website (click the previous browser tab), and click View Page on the top menu bar. You’ll see the page title Practice fade in. To see the effect again, press F5 to refresh the browser page.</p>
<p class="body">There are, of course, hundreds of variations, settings, interactions, and special effects such as animations you can experiment with to improve the default look described on your site’s theme’s CSS file.

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_16">7.5 Understanding CSS scope</h2>
<p class="body">Here, we’re entering another nerd zone. This next information gets a bit specialized, so if you’re not a techie, feel free to skip the next couple of sections and tune back in at section 7.8. <a id="idIndexMarker103"/><a id="marker-194"/><a id="idIndexMarker104"/></p>
<p class="body">You might have noticed when looking at the YellowPencil CSS Editor that it has three tabs: Single, Global, and Template. They govern the <i class="fm-italics">scope</i> (the range of influence) of the CSS code. The Single tab only applies that code to the current page, whereas the Global tab applies code to the entire site.</p>
<p class="body">The Template tab is similar to Single, but Template applies the CSS to a particular <i class="fm-italics">type</i> of page (any page that is governed by a specific template). For example, say you’re editing a product page controlled by an e-commerce plugin such as WooCommerce. If you click the Template tab, the CSS styles you apply to the current page also apply to all the other product pages on your site. You can thus maintain a consistent look and feel across all pages of the same type.</p>
<p class="body">To review, here is the most useful, uncomplicated visualization of the CSS cascade. It’s a four-level process:</p>
<ol class="calibre7">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">The browser default properties that the web browser applies to HTML elements if no CSS styles are defined further down the cascade. This is the highest (earliest) level. These properties are intrinsic to the web browser, and not part of WordPress, your site’s database, or any CSS style sheet.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">The site theme’s CSS file (located in your Appearance &gt; Theme File Editor screen). The styles defined in this file are applied site-wide unless they are overruled by duplicate properties specified further down the cascade.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">CSS code that you—the site’s designer—put into the Appearance &gt; Additional CSS screen. These properties are also site-wide (unless you’re defining a CSS class, which can be used in specific <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;div&gt;</code> elements, for example).</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">CSS code added within the HTML in a single page or to smaller zones within that page (a word, an image, a paragraph). This is the lowest and final level of the cascade and overrules everything previous. For example, you can go to your Pages &gt; All Pages screen, click the Practice page, and then click the Text (HTML code) tab in the text box.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-195"/>Now add this HTML/CSS code:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;div style="color: purple;"&gt;
  This text will be purple.
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p class="body">The HTML part of this code is</p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;div&gt;
  This text will be purple.
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p class="body">And the CSS portion of the code is</p>
<pre class="programlisting">style="color: purple;"</pre>
<p class="body">The <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;div&gt;</code> tag allows you to create a <i class="fm-italics">zone</i> where you can apply multiple CSS modifications at once. Here, a foreground color is changed to white, against a purple background color:<a id="idIndexMarker105"/></p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;div style="color: white; background-color: purple;"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; A new color combination!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This text will be white on a purple background.
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p class="body">We wanted white against purple for <i class="fm-italics">both</i> this <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;h2&gt;</code> heading and the <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;p&gt;</code> body text below it. So, we created a <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;div&gt;</code> section to contain the two elements.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Note</span> Recall that the four-level cascade described previously is, to be honest, an oversimplification. CSS has evolved since its introduction in 1996 and, as a direct result of several committee meetings, the CSS cascade has sadly become quite a bit more complex. There are now various kinds of inheritance, scoping limits, scoping roots, proximity, and other factors that can be used if you wish. If you’re interested in learning more about this complexity, you can dive into the latest official committee document here: <a class="url" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-6/">www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-6/</a>.</p>
<p class="body">It’s considered best practice to limit your use of inline CSS. If overused, it can make your styling less readable and harder to maintain. After all, CSS was originally invented to eliminate the need to hand-code each HTML element of a particular type everywhere on a site.</p>
<p class="body">If you find a need to do quite a bit of inline CSS, consider using CSS <i class="fm-italics">classes</i> rather than the <code class="fm-code-in-text">style=</code> attribute. We’ll turn our attention to classes next.<a id="idIndexMarker106"/><a id="idIndexMarker107"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_17">7.6 Working with CSS classes</h2>
<p class="body">CSS classes serve a purpose similar to what CSS in general offers: classes separate the CSS code from the site’s content. Recall that you can define a rule for h1 headings (green and sans serif, for example) in the Appearance &gt; Customize &gt; Additional CSS screen. When defined in that screen, <i class="fm-italics">all</i> the h1 headings on the site are automatically rendered green and sans. Thus, the styling code doesn’t need to be hand-typed into each h1 element on the site. Instead, the styles defined once in the Additional CSS screen are automatically applied to every h1 element.<a id="idIndexMarker108"/><a id="marker-196"/><a id="idIndexMarker109"/></p>
<p class="body">That’s clearly a more efficient approach than having to type in the same style properties dozens of times using inline styles for <i class="fm-italics">each</i> h1 heading on the site. Another benefit is that if you change your mind and want the color to be blue instead of green, you only have to make that change in one place by modifying the h1 CSS rule in the Additional CSS screen. Then, the change will radiate throughout the site, modifying all the h1 headings.</p>
<p class="body">CSS classes can also be defined in the Additional CSS screen. Classes can be used with inline CSS (they can also be used in external style sheets and elsewhere). A CSS class can be added to individual HTML elements such as h1, one by one, with inline CSS. Similar to how you use inline CSS, its <code class="fm-code-in-text">style=</code> attribute is typed in to each h1 element on the site. In other words, you type a class attribute into an HTML element just as you did when adding a style attribute for inline CSS.<a id="idIndexMarker110"/></p>
<p class="body">Inline CSS using the <code class="fm-code-in-text">style=</code> attribute is shown here:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;p style="color: green; font-weight: bold;"&gt;This
is a green and sans sentence.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
<p class="body">And here’s inline CSS using the <code class="fm-code-in-text">class=</code> attribute:<a id="idIndexMarker111"/></p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;p class="greensans"&gt;This is a green and sans sentence.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
<p class="body">So, if you have to type in a class attribute to every h1 element that you want to apply the class’s style to, what’s the point of using classes at all instead of the <code class="fm-code-in-text">style=</code> attribute? Well, there are two advantages to using <code class="fm-code-in-text">class=</code> instead of the inline CSS <code class="fm-code-in-text">style=</code>:<a id="idIndexMarker112"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">When a rule has multiple properties, the <code class="fm-code-in-text">style=</code> attribute <i class="fm-italics">must</i> list them <i class="fm-italics">all</i> for each HTML element (each h1 heading, for example). But with the <code class="fm-code-in-text">class=</code> attribute, you need only use the class name, such as <code class="fm-code-in-text">greensans</code> shown in the previous code. This makes things shorter and simpler.<a id="idIndexMarker113"/><a id="idIndexMarker114"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">If you later decide to change the color from green to brown, you only need to make that change in the class definition, instead of modifying by hand every h1 heading individually using <code class="fm-code-in-text">style=</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">Note that there are several kinds of selectors in CSS, but we’re concerned here with the two main ones: HTML element tag names and classes. HTML tag names are predefined, and you can’t change them. You must use <code class="fm-code-in-text">h1</code> when referring to that heading element. By contrast, you can name classes anything you choose—you make up the names for classes. Among other things, this means if you want to overrule a class defined by the developers of your theme’s CSS, you have to figure out what exactly those developers called that class. (This used to be hard to figure out sometimes, but when using the YellowPencil plugin, it’s no problem at all.) Let’s now try an example that shows how to use a class.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   1.  Go to your Appearance &gt; Customize &gt; Additional CSS screen, and type in this class definition (use any name for this class that you like):</p>
<pre class="programlistinge">.greensans {
  color: green;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}</pre>
<p class="body-dialog">   2.  Click the Publish button.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   3.  Go to your Pages &gt; All Pages screen, and then click a page title to open its Edit Page screen.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   4.  Click the Text tab on the top-right area of the text box.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   5.  Type the following into that page’s text box:</p>
<pre class="programlistinge">&lt;h1 class="greensans"&gt;My first headline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 class="greensans"&gt;The second headline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p class="greensans"&gt;You can apply a class to any HTML element, like this
 paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
<p class="body-dialog">   6.  Click the Update button.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   7.  Click View Page to see the changes.</p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">
<p class="fm-sidebar-title">Defining classes</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Although WordPress doesn’t provide direct access to the entire HTML code for a page or post, classes are sometimes defined within a <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt;</code> tag pair. This pair is located at the top of the HTML for a page, inside the <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;</code> tag pair. This zone is called the <i class="fm-italics">head</i> of the HTML document, and is where metadata not visible to the user is located—JavaScript, “internal” CSS, and so on. <a id="idIndexMarker115"/><a id="idIndexMarker116"/><a id="idIndexMarker117"/><a id="marker-197"/><a id="idIndexMarker118"/></p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Classes can also be defined in an external style sheet that’s linked to a page in the <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;head&gt;</code> section, like this:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
&lt;body&gt;</pre>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Here are the major zones within an HTML document, illustrating where a page-wide CSS class can be defined:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
.greensans {
  color: green;
  font-family: sans-serif;
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!-- The primary content displayed in the web page--&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="body">If you define a class in this head location, it only applies to that particular page. However, to type in “internal” CSS in WordPress, you can’t use the code view (the Text tab in an Edit Page screen) option. WordPress doesn’t display <i class="fm-italics">all</i> the HTML in a page when you select code view. Instead, you have to edit the theme’s header.php file. And that’s not a good idea unless you’re an expert PHP coder. Even then, when the theme updates, your class definition will be overwritten.</p>
<p class="body">This ends the tech zone. We now return to our regular content. <a id="idIndexMarker119"/><a id="idIndexMarker120"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_18">7.7 CSS in Gutenberg</h2>
<p class="body">Just like the classic editor, the WordPress block editor responds to CSS code that you type into the Appearance &gt; Customize &gt; Additional CSS screen (as described in previous examples in this chapter). However, at the time of this writing, in Gutenberg, you can only see the effects of the CSS when viewing the frontend via the Preview option. In the page or post-editing screens, the changes aren’t visible (usually). <a id="idIndexMarker121"/><a id="marker-198"/><a id="idIndexMarker122"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> When describing how to use Gutenberg, the term <i class="fm-italics">usually</i> pops up fairly often. Even after years of work, the talented people at WordPress are still polishing this work in progress. To me, Gutenberg is a worthy goal that will be achieved one day. For now, there are workarounds you must memorize, as the rest of this section illustrates. I look forward to switching from the classic WordPress editor to Gutenberg when the latter stabilizes and is relatively free of bugs. But my hope is that switching between the classic and block editors will be possible via a single mouse click. Each editor has its strengths.</p>
<p class="body">As in the classic editor, in Gutenberg, you can add global, site-wide CSS code in the Additional CSS screen. For now, though, let’s see how to add <i class="fm-italics">inline</i> CSS locally using Gutenberg—adding CSS to a single HTML element such as paragraph body text (HTML element <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;p&gt;)</code>.<a id="idIndexMarker123"/></p>
<p class="body">Surprisingly, there are <i class="fm-italics">five</i> ways in Gutenberg to access and modify HTML using inline CSS code! Go to the Pages &gt; All Pages screen, and click a page title to get to its Edit Page screen. Click + to add a C<i class="fm-italics">lassic</i> block (<i class="fm-italics">not</i> the Paragraph block) to the page, and type <code class="fm-code-in-text">This is a paragraph</code>, into that block.<a id="idIndexMarker124"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> Currently, if you try to add inline CSS to the Paragraph block, you’re going to run into difficulties, that is, bugs. After you add the CSS using code view, preview the page, and then click Edit Page to return to the editor, Gutenberg posts an error message claiming that Unexpected or Invalid Content is in your block. That’s untrue—the content is both as expected and valid. Then, Gutenberg offers to fix the problem by displaying an Attempt Block Recovery button. This “fix” simply deletes the block! It’s as if you go to the dentist to fix a tooth, and the dentist shoots you.<a id="idIndexMarker125"/></p>
<p class="body">Click the Classic block to select it, and then click View &gt; Source Code from the menu on the toolbar. Add this inline CSS style to your paragraph’s text:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;p style="color: red;"&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
<p class="body">Click OK. You’ll now see the change, even in the page editor (no need to click either Update or Preview). Or, if you’ve defined a CSS class (in your Appearance &gt; Customize &gt; Additional CSS screen), you can apply the class in the same inline way using the <code class="fm-code-in-text">class=</code> attribute instead of <code class="fm-code-in-text">style=</code>, like this:<a id="idIndexMarker126"/></p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;p class="greensans"&gt;This text&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
<p class="body">Alternatively, when a block is selected (in other words, its toolbar is visible), you can press Ctrl-Shift-Alt-M to switch to code view and manage the inline CSS there. Click Exit Code Editor to return to the visual editor.</p>
<p class="body">Another alternative is to choose Tools &gt; Source Code, which has the same effect as choosing View &gt; Source Code. Yet another alternative is to click the three dots in the upper-right corner and choose Code Editor, which has the same effect as pressing Ctrl-Shift-Alt-M.</p>
<p class="body">Given that Gutenberg sometimes assumes that five ways to do the same thing is better than one, you can also apply CSS classes to a block using a special Advanced module. As mentioned previously, adding <code class="fm-code-in-text">class=</code> via inline CSS works fine to apply a class rule to an HTML element such as a heading or body text. You just define a class in the Additional CSS screen as usual, and then type <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;h1</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">class="classname"&gt;headline&lt;/h1&gt;</code> in the HTML element.<a id="marker-199"/><a id="idIndexMarker127"/></p>
<p class="body">And there’s yet <i class="fm-italics">another</i> way in Gutenberg to add a CSS class inline. You click a block and then click the three dots in the upper-right corner of the editing screen (this works with some blocks, but not all). You’ll now see a sidebar on the right (usually, not always). Click the Block tab in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="body">Finally, scroll down to the Advanced module, and open it by clicking its down arrow. You’ll usually see an opportunity to add classes to the currently selected block by typing a CSS class’s name into the Additional CSS Class(es) field, as shown in figure 7.13.</p>

<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Warning</span> The right sidebar in Gutenberg is buggy, at least at the time of this writing. Neither the Classic block nor the similar Classic Paragraph block allow you to add CSS using the Advanced module. You can’t even <i class="fm-italics">view</i> the sidebar. You must first change the Classic block into a block (paradoxical, isn’t it?). To do that, you click Convert to Blocks displayed in the Classic block’s top toolbar (there are two toolbars, one above the other). You logically thought that the Classic block <i class="fm-italics">was</i> a block, but never mind. The Classic—let’s call it a pseudoblock—has to be converted to a real block before you can access the sidebar and its Advanced module. All this isn’t really worth the trouble. It’s easier to just ty<a id="idTextAnchor013"/>pe in the <code class="fm-code-in-text">block=</code> attribute by hand yourself using the code view option. That way you can continue using the Classic pseudoblock.<a id="idIndexMarker128"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Warning</span> When you use a class name in this Additional CSS Class(es) feature, don’t precede the name with a period (as you must do when <i class="fm-italics">defining</i> a class in the Additional CSS screen).</p>
<p class="body">When you type the class name into the Additional CSS Class(es) field, WordPress adds the necessary <code class="fm-code-in-text">class=</code> attribute to your HTML, just as if you’d switched to code view and typed it in yourself. <a id="idIndexMarker129"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_19">7.8 Inpainting and outpainting</h2>
<p class="body">AI <i class="fm-italics">inpainting</i> makes it easy to remove or replace unwanted objects in an image. With inpainting, you select an object by dragging a selection lasso around the object. Then, you either request its removal or describe what you want to replace it with. <a id="idIndexMarker130"/><a id="idIndexMarker131"/><a id="marker-200"/><a id="idIndexMarker132"/></p>

<p class="body"><i class="fm-italics">Outpainting</i> is the opposite of cropping. Recall that when you crop a picture, you cut off one or more of its sides. This is often done to move the focal point onto an intersection of the lines in the rule of thirds. This can also improve the balance of the image.</p>
<p class="body">Now, thanks to AI, you can (amazingly) <i class="fm-italics">extend</i> the image, <i class="fm-italics">adding</i> content to one or more sides that never existed before! AI invents additional visual content beyond the current view, but it doesn’t duplicate existing content. Instead, it creates a variation, a visually logical extension of the existing content.</p>
<p class="body">If, for example, you’re working with a beach scene, you could extend the beach on the left or right side, or both. Outpainting in this way will retain the qualities of the current beach, but widen the image. Or you could expand the top of the image to extend the sky. You also can extend the foreground by outpainting past the bottom of the image. It’s a new technique and not available prior to AI.</p>
<p class="body">When outpainting, AI doesn’t just copy the existing content. You won’t get a second cloud that looks like a cloud that exists in the original image. Remember that AI is <i class="fm-italics">intelligent.</i> It can perceptively interpret what would likely appear in a wider view of a scene and give you variations to choose from. Extend the beach, and you could easily get just more beach, but with variations in the sand, or shadows, or perhaps a palm tree as well (or <i class="fm-italics">you</i> could type <i class="fm-italics">palm tree</i> into the generative outpainting toolbar if you do want a palm tree in the outpainted space). These are techniques worth knowing, so let’s take a look at how they’re done.</p>
<p class="body">Although Midjourney and other text-to-image systems have tools that can generate these modifications, currently Photoshop’s tools are the easiest to master. So, let’s use Photoshop to do some inpainting.</p>
<p class="body">Photoshop calls inpainting and outpainting <i class="fm-italics">generative fill</i> and <i class="fm-italics">generative expand.</i> Both will automatically match the lighting, perspective, and other qualities that preserve the overall content and style of the image. This happens in seconds, and the results are often startlingly appropriate. It’s as if the original photographer had used a wider lens, or Dali had painted three elephants on stilts in the background.<a id="marker-201"/></p>
<p class="body">Take a look at figure 7.14. This Midjourney-generated golden mask can benefit from some modifications. First, there’s no strong focal point. So, we’ll make the lips the focal point by asking Photoshop to color them with vermillion enamel. Based on what area we select, the shape of the lips can also be changed.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="1427" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH07_F14_Mansfield.png" width="1127"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 7.14 Photoshop will generate three variations of red enamel on the mask’s lips, now that they have been selected with the lasso tool, and our prompt described the material we’re after.<a id="marker-202"/></p>
</div>
<p class="body">In Photoshop, you can use its lasso tool to draw a selection region. This is the area that will be replaced with enamel. So, with the lasso, I roughly followed the outline of the lips, which leaves behind a dashed line showing what’s selected. A generative toolbar appears in the bottom of the screen, as you can see in figure 7.14. If you just click Generate, without typing in any text, it removes the selected object, filling in the space with whatever surrounds it.</p>
<p class="body">However, our goal is to modify, not delete, these lips, so I typed in “glossy vermillion enamel” as the text prompt, and then clicked Generate.</p>
<p class="body">You can repeatedly click Generate, getting three new variations each time, until you find one you like best. Figure 7.15 shows the best result out of nine variations. The coloring is good, and the pursed shape of the lips is more intriguing, at least to me.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="883" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH07_F15_Mansfield.png" width="900"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 7.15 The best of nine variations, featuring pursed lips for added interest<a id="marker-203"/></p>
</div>
<p class="body">Now that the lips are vermillion, to make them clearly the focal point, we’ll use the cropping tool to move the lips onto a rule-of-thirds grid line. Also, the eyes are now on two intersections, as is the right side of the face. We’re outpainting now, and, in this case, we’re dragging the frame down and to the right. These currently black areas will be filled in by Photoshop with appropriate variations on the current background, or with a new background that I specify.</p>
<p class="body">For outpainting in Photoshop, you use the crop tool and drag one or more of that tool’s frame handles to show where the expanding should take place. The image is transformed significantly in figure 7.16. I typed “gold velvet curtains” into the generative toolbar, so Photoshop will add a less focused, softer texture to contrast with the hard metal, but retain the color. As you can see in figure 7.16, this also adds background blur, a common technique in photography called shallow depth of field.</p>
<p class="body">This chapter was all about advanced design techniques and tools. It began with an overview of historical design trends and the minimalist aesthetic that currently inspires the majority of architecture, fashion, and, of course, websites. Then, you explored CSS—the design language that allows you to modify your site’s theme with considerable freedom. And, you saw how to use a powerful CSS plugin, or AI systems, to write CSS code for you. You don’t have to learn CSS to use it.</p>

<p class="body"><a id="marker-204"/>Next, you learned how to work with CSS using the WordPress Gutenberg block editor. The chapter concluded with how to use AI outpainting and inpainting tools to intelligently add, remove, or expand content in images.</p>
<p class="body">Now, it’s time to move away from design topics and explore other ways to enliven a website by adding multimedia: audio, video, and images. In the next chapter, we’ll also take a look at how to ensure that your site is accessible for people facing various challenges. And we’ll consider some legal problems involving media permissions and attributions, before concluding by showing you how to manage multimedia if you choose to work with the Gutenberg editor.<a id="idIndexMarker135"/><a id="idIndexMarker136"/><a id="idIndexMarker137"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_20">Summary</h2>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Typical adjectives that describe today’s architecture and other styles in areas such as clothing fashion and website design include <i class="fm-italics">modern</i>, <i class="fm-italics">minimalist</i>, <i class="fm-italics">simple</i>, <i class="fm-italics">clean</i>, and <i class="fm-italics">elegant</i>. And for most websites, it’s a good idea to design the site with an eye to displaying elegant, contemporary pages. This also includes subtle, restrained use of animation and media.<a id="marker-205"/></p>

<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Cascading style sheets (CSS) is an effective design language with which your site’s look can be honed, giving it an appearance that is both unlike other sites and also in tune with your site’s purpose.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">The Inspector is a set of tools found in most browsers. It’s useful for, among other things, learning the basics of CSS and how CSS modifies and interacts with the HTML code that underpins the display of web pages.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">You need not learn the CSS language because there is a powerful plugin called YellowPencil that automatically generates CSS for you. You use sliders, color wheels, and other high-level WYSIWYG tools to fine-tune a page’s design, and then YellowPencil creates the CSS by itself. Also, AI systems such as Claude (<a class="url" href="https://claude.ai">https://claude.ai</a>) are increasingly skilled at programming, CSS included.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Among the most useful AI-powered art tools are inpainting and outpainting.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">With inpainting, you can remove something from an image, or replace it by describing what you want to take its place.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Although there are some bugs and necessary workarounds, CSS can be used in WordPress’s Gutenberg editor.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Outpainting means you can extend one or more of the sides of an image. This is the opposite of cropping, which trims one or more of the edges. Cropping has been used for centuries. But outpainting only became possible when AI appeared. The extensions of the image must blend in with the rest of the image, but they must also be original and a variation. It can’t just be a copy. Human artists can do this, but prior to AI, no computer could.</p>
