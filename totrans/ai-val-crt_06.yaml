    don’t get the skills right, both for you as an individual and collectively for
    your organization, and that’s why we put this chapter in this book.

    the required knowledge, skill sets, and experience are rare. In this GenAI and
    agentic era, we will see a rapid expansion in the need for highly specialized
    skills like modelers, engineers, data wranglers, and more. But this is not where
    it ends. When it comes to completely changing the way your business operates (shift
    left, shift right, get to AI+), there will be other very strong skill factors
    at play too—get this right or risk not moving your organization forward at the
    pace needed to get the most out of your AI journey. We’ve seen many companies
    buy skills (acquire a small company or go on a hiring spree) and fold them into
    their organizations, yet these actions didn’t result in an enterprise-wide change
    to the overall skills posture. Why? To thrive in the GenAI game, skills need to
    be looked at as overall organizational capability so *everyone* can lift their
    portion of the business. This means there are other talent-related factors at
    play, such as company culture and organizational silos, which can all pose major
    problems when it comes to AI adoption.

    to anyone. After all, lots of people had smartphones at the time, digital payments
    were a thing, and GPS was ubiquitous because everyone got directions and weather
    from their smartphones. Companies like Uber put those things together with a new
    shifted-right business model, but they operated in a different way. Instead of
    waiting for a taxi to drive by and hailing a cab, or making a phone call to a
    dispatcher, they asked, “What if we allowed people to summon a driver from their
    smartphone with full transparency as to expected wait times, driver details, car,
    and more?” Do not overlook this moment. Uber came up with a different business
    model, and people loved it. It wasn’t so much the technology at all, and (again)
    that technology was sitting around for anyone (here it comes) to put to use to
    stop walking by problems they could solve or make better with technology every
    day. Uber just happened to do it first. How? Uber used Osmon’s equation and multiplied
    knowledge (skills) and effort and turned that into success. What’s more, Uber’s
    take on the gig economy has since grown from ride-sharing to a model for home
    delivery of almost anything. So, like we said, we don’t think AI will replace

    and boundless discovery. Yet in today’s age of democratized access to information
    and technology, curiosity *thrills* the cat. So, while this chapter will get into
    some corporate programs and ideas to help upskill your business, never overlook
    the most important ingredient: *the innate curiosity in the people you hire*.
    You name the persona; we’ve managed them or seen them all. We’ve worked with people
    who are talented in a way no one can practice or rehearse. Others that are so
    curious that if something doesn’t make sense to them, they are off on the internet
    looking for answers and getting lost in some course. On the other end of the spectrum
    are those who look at assigned learning and come back to declare, “This isn’t
    my job; why should I take it?” or “I’m not in sales; why should I learn how our
    company sells our product? I just code,” and all the parts in between. You will
    *never go wrong hiring people who are naturally curious*. Quite simply, if tech
    years are like dog years (or age even faster like AI’s mouse years), then all
    the educational head start that formally educated staff had will fade away as
    time marches on.'

    composer Wolfgang Mozart who was recognized as a musical genius by the age of
    six. Mozart had not only created his first composition^([5](ch06.html#id849))
    (at age five) but had performed in front of two royal courts. One day, an aspiring
    composer in his twenties came to Mozart and said to him something along the lines
    of, “I want to compose symphonies; can you teach me?” Mozart looked at him and
    said, “You can’t learn how to compose symphonies; you’re not old enough.” The
    man remarked about being in his twenties and how Mozart was just 10 when he composed
    his first symphony.^([6](ch06.html#id850)) Mozart (known as much for being direct
    as he was for his music) replied, “Yes, but I wasn’t walking around asking people
    how to do it.”

    guidance (learning plans) and learning from others are important, true mastery
    and capability come from within. As leaders, you must find a way to move your
    staff beyond seeking instructions to seeking their own knowledge experiments.
    Remember, your organization will need a mix of prescriptive journeys, but perhaps
    even more, forums that spotlight and encourage that natural resource of curiosity.

    offer to review their speaker submission forms or be a safe space to preview their

    maker that turns someone from a curious observer to a confident, passionate leader.
    For example, at IBM we have programs where managers can use their budgets to pay

    think that if you show up to work every day and you’re not scared of anything,

    seller is expected to do a live scripted demo, whereas a technical seller is expected
    to go way off script (at the behest of the client), explain things deeply, and
    customize that live demo to a certain degree. And make no mistake about it, we’ve
    got some super technical people, and some of them hate Level 1 and Level 2\. Perfect!

    guide, we’ll presume we are making those sellers more technical. To verify the
    veracity of our can’t fail claims, at times we get middle school students to finish
    a Level 3\. This also makes for a great retort when some of our sellers come up

    technology projects; we want shift left and shift right business value projects.
    At this level, the learner is focused on how to highlight their client’s pain
    points (not asking...they already know them) and perhaps introduce them to ones
    they don’t know they have (or are going to have—like explainable AI). This is
    where the learner works through things like creating that aha moment, or the client
    remarks, “Gee...I never thought of it this way before” (this stuff is pure gold
    with clients because it means the seller is teaching, not pushing part numbers).
    Learners progress through these levels by writing some open book tests (kind of
    like a Coursera course). We want to ensure that learners have gone through the
    material and know where to come back when they hit the forgetting curves (more
    on this in a bit). In these levels, we’re sure that some sellers “cheat” themselves
    and just search for the answers (just like they could do in a Coursera course).
    We’re good with that. Why? At some point, they’re going to be live in front of
    a client and will be in a panic. They will scramble to learn and appreciate the
    learning then—and perhaps bring a different point of view the next time. And,
    quite honestly, to be good at something, often you have to be bad at it first
    and learn through the pain. Of course, if you’re an expert, you can skip the lesson,

    last decades (one report has it lower than a goldfish at eight seconds), we are
    all going to forget many of the things we learn. One of the biggest challenges
    when training large models is that GPUs don’t hold a lot of memory. When they
    run out, they have to offload data into CPU caches, and when that runs out, it
    goes to system memory and then to disk...every offload significantly impacts performance.
    Your brain is no different (except you don’t get yearly capacity upgrades), and

    stuff. This is the part of the roller coaster (called *the drop*) where gravity
    takes over and that stomach-lurching plunge sets in. For learners, we call this
    the *forgetting curve*. And just like a roller coaster, one of two things is going

    We call this the *scramble learning* part of the learning curve—and this is where
    high-quality content producers become heroes. This is where your sellers need
    to jump back to some past learning to get the pieces they need, and parts they
    will inevitably forget (but do it in a mad dash to prep for a client meeting or
    call). Look, you might know how GenAI can be prompted for better results, but
    you may need a brush-up on the difference between using fine-tuning or a low-rank
    adaptation (LoRA) adapter to better fine-tune your LLM for the task at hand. Perhaps
    you just need a refresher on the definition of DevSecOps. We find that sellers
    have loads of love to give during the scramble learning phase as opposed to the
    event and course portion where you get some love, but you’ll get your share of
    moans and groans for any assigned learning too.

    to teach learners how to be a part of their own rescue—to know where to find the
    cheat codes in the learning and refresh themselves with just enough, at just the
    right time. Metadata helps here, too. If the learning is delivered by subject
    matter experts (SMEs), capture the syllabus, notes, and key takeaways so learning
    assets can be centrally accessed at a later time. Teach the learner how and where
    to find these—laying down the breadcrumbs to help with the scramble inevitably
    results in gratefulness.

    to parts they need to remember by asking for it. For example, if a learner wanted
    to get back up to speed on prompting techniques, an LLM could generate links to
    those locations. Even better: the LLM assembles a 30-second summary on the request
    for all the coverage areas in the 3-hour GenAI class, with a hot-linked table
    of contents to portions of the video that are stitched together—think of it as
    a prompt-tuning highlight reel. Now turn this up another notch and let AI index
    and generate a turn conversation with a seller posing as a client. After about
    four or five questions (such as “Explain to me the value of putting my data into
    a model, but also the risks”), it returns a report card across key measures (quality
    of answer, use of jargon, and so on). It’s a great way for nervous sellers to
    gain confidence in the privacy of a no-judgment zone. Perhaps use the AI to make
    a podcast of the material like what Google’s NotebookLM can do. There are lots

    leaders who lead by doing have teams who know their leader’s values (and understands)

    already completed it! To be honest, when you lead like this, dropping real insights

    back-to-the-office policies of companies and the potential that lies within, The
    Challenge brought people together on their own will with a shared outcome. The
    Challenge didn’t demand people work in person at all. In fact, some teams had
    people from across geographies. But many teams got into a lab and worked with
    people they never knew before...creating new social connections that could help
    solve future problems, introduce new mentorships, new jobs, and more. If you’re
    on a management team struggling with bringing people back to the office, this
    challenge was a great way to not just upskill the masses but also offer a compelling
    reason to connect in person. Try it!

    (that’s ~60% of our workforce—remember, voluntary) trained on our companies newest
    AI offerings, sharing our message more confidently and singing from the same song
    sheet in countries and communities around the world. This time, they created a
    community in the form of 30,000 teams and made a whopping 8 million inferences
    (nerd talk for having an AI do what you ask it to do) calls a day! They collectively
    submitted 12,000+ prototype projects for evaluation. On top of all of this, live
    testing of 50,000+ workloads, and more than 8,000 pages of feature requests, feature
    enhancements, usability improvements, resiliency tests, bug reports, and new use
    cases were identified across the wide suite of IBM watsonx-branded products—channeling
    a skills growth project into a productivity multiplier. Amazing! And after all
    that (and why we’re talking about it in this chapter), 88% of IBMers significantly
    thumbed-up the question, “Did you increase your AI skills in this challenge?”'

    ideas. We picked the top dozen or so and rewarded them, and some of them got all
    the way to production and completely shifted-left how many IBMers do their work
    today in 2025\. Here are some winning examples:'

    get containerized and evolve into microservices and function as a service (FaaS)
    components, it becomes more of a reality that you don’t really build applications
    anymore, you compose them from discrete pieces of business logic (reminder: the
    mindset required to modernize the application landscape is the same as that to
    move from +AI to AI+). Today, these pieces are often distributed across estates
    (different hyperscalers, clouds, and on premises) that all come together to make
    a single application. These pieces can run ephemerally and often in under a second.
    While Agile is terrific for development, it’s become somewhat horrific for SREs—the
    people who keep stuff running. This winning project used AI to house a corpus
    of answers to common questions. We’re not talking a FAQ spray-and-pray approach
    here, we’re talking similarity searching to the task at hand. (Remember the Queen
    and System of a Down song recommendations we talked about in [Chapter 2](ch02.html#ch02_oh_to_be_an_ai_value_creator_1740182046162988)?)
    Before, this SRE team spent 116 hours a week answering routine questions...today,
    it’s less than 2 minutes because 99.98% of questions are deflected, leaving deep
    experts to keep on working and those stuck with near instantaneous frictionless
    answers. Someone cue the Shift Left theme song!'

    base. They had thousands of files, so they took a couple dozen as a pilot and
    put AI to work, summarizing at the start of the file what the code block did.
    Each file took about 12 seconds for the code assistant to summarize. Now, early
    professional hires can have a “conversation” with this code base using watsonx
    Code Assistant and get instant summaries on how the code block works and what
    it’s supposed to do. Imagine being new to a code base and asking, “What do you
    do for high availability of essential services?” and in return get an overview
    of a library that tells you this is the common client retry logic for any connection,
    this is the heartbeat detection with seconds to live until a problem is declared,
    and so on. It’s all right in the code, but anyone who’s taken over blocks of a
    code base knows that documentation is one of those things that is low on the priority
    list. Ask any developer, and they’ll tell you how they documented the code, and
    when you go to look at it, there’s the following: `*# TODO: Add documentation
    to this block*`. These are all part of the use cases we talked about for developers
    in [Chapter 4](ch04.html#ch04_the_use_case_chapter_1740182047877425).'

    have become much more interesting to our clients because of it. Interestingly
    enough, employees we talk to tell us they’re more job marketable too. Of course,
    we don’t want them to leave IBM—but those that put the effort into The Challenge
    clearly found that secret zipper that expands their skills suitcase to get more
    packed in case they decide to journey elsewhere. But as we always say, our employees’
    jobs are to come to work every day and give us the best they’ve got on that day
    (it can vary). Our job? Give them a reason to come to work every day and give
    us the best they’ve got on that day. We think building something and stuffing
    your skills suitcase are great reasons beyond a paycheck (which is important)
    to come to work every day.

    productive, you will eventually need fewer of them. As we noted with bank tellers,
    *that**’**s actually been false in history*. Think about it: if you are more productive,
    that means you have a natural economic advantage against your competition, which
    means you’re going to get more work, which means you’re going to need more people.
    We think sometimes people forget that—they come from a zero-sum mentality to say
    it’s a zero-sum game. So yes, certain roles will shrink because you don’t need
    so many people doing them (maybe, email responses or phone calls), but then it
    will shift to maybe building more applications or digital sales, and so on.'

    on that, but there’s no doubt about it, a second bucket is filling with new jobs,
    workflows, and new ways of working. AI is not just about an increase in productivity,
    or a reduction in processes, or an automation that replaces people, or an insurance
    policy against your competitors. By creating an inventory and a plan to upskill,
    you’re fueling your workforce with skills and, in time, will open your organization
    to new unforeseen innovations and efficiency.

    This is why we (perhaps surprisingly to you) spent a lot of time on AI skilling
    in our book—and while we’re at it, don’t limit this to technical or sales staff,
    your efforts must be pushed out more broadly across the entire enterprise, in
    every line of business. Are you ready to level up some learning?
