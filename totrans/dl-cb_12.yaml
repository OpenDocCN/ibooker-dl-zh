    networks see when they classify images. We’ll do this by running the networks
    in reverse—rather than giving the network an image and asking it what it is, we
    tell the network what to see and ask it to modify the image in a way that makes
    it see the detected item more exaggeratedly.

    concept of octaves, where we zoom in while we optimize the image to get more detail.
    Finally, we will look at applying this technique to existing images and visualize
    what the network “almost” sees in an image, a technique known as deep dreaming.

    to render a recent photograph in the style of Vincent van Gogh’s *Starry Skies*.
    Finally, we’ll use two style images and render versions of the same picture somewhere
    between the two styles.

    the picture globally looking like the content image. Effectively what we’re doing
    here is optimizing the generated image such that the activations in the upper
    layers correspond to the content image and the activations of the lower layers
    to the style image. Since the lower layers correspond to style and the higher
    layers to content, we can accomplish style transfer this way.

    rather than a noise image, but the results aren’t that great. At first it seems
    it is applying the style to the existing image, but with each step the original
    image dissolves a little. If we keep applying the algorithm the end result will
    be more or less the same, independent of the starting image.

    between two different styles. Nothing is stopping us, of course, from adding even
    more style images and varying their weights. It’s also worth exploring varying
    the relative weights of the style images; van Gogh’s *Starry Skies* image is very
    stark and its style will easily overpower that of more subtle paintings.
