- en: This section introduces the fundamental concepts and technologies that underpin
    generative AI. We start with a general overview of what generative AI can do,
    how it works, and how it can be applied in various enterprise settings. Then we
    examine the details of large language models (LLMs), such as their structures,
    categories, and main concepts. The final chapters in this section cover generating
    text, images, and similar things through APIs, offering a hands-on guide to accessing
    and utilizing these technologies.
