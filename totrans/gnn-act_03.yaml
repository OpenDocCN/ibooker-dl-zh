- en: Now that you understand the basics, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and dive
    into the core architectures that make graph neural networks (GNNs) work. This
    section bridges the theoretical and practical by introducing key GNN architectures
    and applying them to real-world problems. You’ll explore foundational models such
    as graph convolutional networks (GCNs), GraphSAGE, and graph attention networks
    (GATs), as well as graph autoencoders (GAEs)—each designed to harness the unique
    structure of graph data.

  zh: 现在您已经了解了基础知识，是时候卷起袖子深入探索使图神经网络（GNNs）工作的核心架构了。本节通过介绍关键GNN架构并将其应用于实际问题，将理论与实际相结合。您将探索基础模型，如图卷积网络（GCNs）、GraphSAGE和图注意力网络（GATs），以及图自动编码器（GAEs）——每个都是为利用图数据的独特结构而设计的。
- en: These architectures come to life through real-world applications. They have
    been used for fake review detection, product category prediction, and molecular
    graph generation for drug discovery. By blending cutting-edge models with highly
    effective use cases, this part of the book provides both the understanding and
    practical tools needed to unlock the transformative potential of GNNs in your
    projects.
