    10,000 most common words was a crude form of feature selection, for instance.

    each feature available — a measure of how informative the feature is with respect
    to the task, such as the mutual information between the feature and the labels
    — and only keep features that are above some threshold. Doing this would filter

    models (see chapter 13). More generally, deep neural networks structure their

    consequence of any property of your model. You’ll only be able to generalize if
    your data forms a manifold where points can be interpolated. The more informative
    and the less noisy your features are, the better you will be able to generalize,

    *it needs to be trained on a dense sampling of its input space*. A “dense sampling”
    in this context means that the training data should densely cover the entirety
    of the input data manifold (see figure 5.11). This is especially true near decision
    boundaries. With a sufficiently dense sampling, it becomes possible to make sense
    of new inputs by interpolating between past training inputs, without having to
    use common-sense, abstract reasoning, or external knowledge about the world —
    all things that machine learning models have no access to.

- en: Central to this phenomenon is the notion of *information leaks*. Every time
    you tune a hyperparameter of your model based on the model’s performance on the
    validation set, some information about the validation data leaks into the model.
    If you do this only once, for one parameter, then very few bits of information
    will leak, and your validation set will remain reliable to evaluate the model.
    But if you repeat this many times — running one experiment, evaluating on the
    validation set, and modifying your model as a result — then you’ll leak an increasingly
    significant amount of information about the validation set into the model.

    Let’s say a given layer would normally return a vector `[0.2, 0.5, 1.3, 0.8, 1.1]`
    for a given input sample during training. After applying dropout, this vector
    will have a few zero entries distributed at random: for example, `[0, 0.5, 1.3,
    0, 1.1]`. The *dropout rate* is the fraction of the features that are zeroed out;
    it’s usually set between 0.2 and 0.5\. At test time, no units are dropped out;
    instead, the layer’s output values are scaled down by a factor equal to the dropout
    rate, to balance for the fact that more units are active than at training time.'
