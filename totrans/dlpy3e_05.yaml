    and generalization. *Optimization* refers to the process of adjusting a model
    to get the best performance possible on the training data (the *learning* in *machine
    learning*), whereas *generalization* refers to how well the trained model performs
    on data it has never seen before. The goal of the game is to get good generalization,
    of course, but you don’t control generalization; you can only fit the model to
    its training data. If you do that *too well*, overfitting kicks in and generalization

    boundaries, so the same picture might be classified as either unripened or ripe
    by different human labelers. Similarly, many problems involve randomness. You

    10,000 most common words was a crude form of feature selection, for instance.

    simplest way to mitigate overfitting is to reduce the size of the model (the number
    of learnable parameters in the model, determined by the number of layers and the
    number of units per layer). If the model has limited memorization resources, it
    won’t be able to simply memorize its training data. To minimize its loss, it will
    have to resort to learning compressed representations that have predictive power
    regarding the targets — precisely the type of representations we’re interested
    in. At the same time, keep in mind that you should use models that have enough
    parameters that they don’t underfit: your model shouldn’t be starved for memorization
    resources. There is a compromise to be found between *too much capacity* and *not

    architectures (on your validation set, not on your test set, of course) to find
    the correct model size for your data. The general workflow to find an appropriate
    model size is to start with relatively few layers and parameters and increase
    the size of the layers or add new layers until you see diminishing returns with
