        <p class="subtitle">Let’s start with its origins. The term “AI” was coined during the 1950s. Concretely, Professor John McCarthy<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="McCarthy, John" id="id201" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> defined artificial intelligence in 1955 as <a href="https://oreil.ly/hir0l" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">“the science and engineering of making intelligent machines”</a>. It is also fair to say that Professor Alan Turing<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Turing, Alan" id="id202" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> previously introduced the notion of thinking machines. In 1956, Dartmouth College hosted the Summer Research Project on AI conference, with a group of participants from the most relevant universities and companies. That conference was led by Prof. McCarthy and other renowned researchers, and it was the beginning of the AI area of research. In the time since, there have been multiple cycles of hype, disappointments due to unrealistic expectations (periods often referred as AI winters due to reduced funding and general interest for AI topics), renovated expectations, and finally vast commercialization of AI-enabled solutions such as personal assistant speakers, intelligent autonomous vacuum cleaners, etc.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">That said, AI has evolved a lot during the last two decades, but the reality is that initially it was mainly and only adopted by some of the biggest companies, such as Microsoft (no, not necessarily for their famous <a href="https://oreil.ly/0iNuM" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Clippy</a>!), Google, Amazon, Uber, and other technology unicorns. That first wave of adoption created a great baseline so they could offer these same capabilities as managed cloud services to other AI adopters out there, which gave them a clear competitive advantage. This started the stage of data and AI democratization we are currently experiencing, where smaller companies are developing or leveraging AI-enabled services, and those solutions are already part of our day-to-day.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Before going into the details, let’s take a step back and analyze the context of what artificial intelligence is today, and what it means for companies and individuals.</p>
        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Current Level of AI Adoption" class="calibre5"><div class="preface" id="current_level_of_ai_adoption">
          <h2 class="calibre21">Current Level of AI Adoption</h2>
          <p class="subtitle">The term “AI adoption<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="artificial intelligence (AI)" data-secondary="adoption of" id="id203" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>” describes how organizations around the world are either implementing AI systems or leveraging AI-enabled tools from other companies. Each company’s level of adoption really depends on several factors, such as technology maturity, type of organization (big or small companies, public administration, startups, etc.), geography, etc. McKinsey indicates that the level of AI adoption in 2022 (from their<a href="https://oreil.ly/6GDdZ" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"> state of AI report</a>) was 50% from all its respondents, with an interesting increase at the international level, and an even more significant increase for developing countries. Additionally, they also estimate<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="generative AI" data-secondary="and AI adoption" data-secondary-sortas="AI adoption" id="id204" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> that <a href="https://oreil.ly/4L3JC" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">generative AI could add to the global economy</a> the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually.</p>
          <p class="subtitle">In addition, Boston Consulting Group <a href="https://oreil.ly/mrLCw" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">defined</a> the level of success and AI maturity as a combination of internal adoption plus the knowledge of AI within the organization, with only 20% of organizations being actual pioneers in terms of AI adoption. Last but not least, Gartner <a href="https://oreil.ly/b-x4K" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">predicts</a> that by 2025, 70% of enterprises will identify the sustainable and ethical use of AI among their top concerns, and 35% of large organizations will have a Chief AI Officer who reports to the CEO or COO.</p>
          <p class="subtitle">These figures show that even if the level of global adoption is increasing, there are still differences in how companies are using AI and how successful they are. The next sections will showcase multiple examples of AI-enabled systems, at both the technology and use case levels.</p>

          <h2 class="calibre21">The Many Technologies of AI</h2>
          <p class="subtitle">There are different ways to define artificial intelligence<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="artificial intelligence (AI)" data-secondary="technologies of" id="xi_artificialintelligenceAItechnologiesof11872" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>, but the reality is that there is not only one single technology under the umbrella of AI. Let’s explore the main AI technologies:</p>
          <dl class="stafflist">
            <dt class="calibre10">Machine learning (ML)</dt>
            <dd class="calibre11">
              <p class="subtitle">A type of AI that relies on advanced statistical models<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="machine learning (ML)" id="id205" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> that learn from past data to predict future situations. Take a simple use case of classifying fruits based on their existing pictures. To describe an apple to the system, we would say it is somewhat round in shape and that its color is a varied shade of red, green, or yellow. As for oranges, the explanation is similar except for the color. The algorithm<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="algorithms" data-secondary="in machine learning" data-secondary-sortas="machine learning" id="id206" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> then takes these attributes (based on past examples) as guidelines for it to understand what each of the fruits looks like. Upon being exposed to more and more samples, it develops a better capacity to differentiate oranges from apples and gets better at correctly identifying them. There are plenty of ML models depending on the kind of algorithm and type of task, but some relevant examples are decision forests, k-means clustering, regressions, and support vector machines (note: if you want to explore this family of AI models, take a look at the <a href="https://oreil.ly/T7JG9" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Microsoft ML Algorithm Cheat Sheet</a>, which explains the type of tasks for different models and their data requirements).</p>
            </dd>
            <dt class="calibre10">Deep learning (DL)</dt>
            <dd class="calibre11">
              <p class="subtitle">Deep learning<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="deep learning (DL)" id="id207" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="DL (deep learning)" id="id208" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> can be defined as a subset of machine learning, with models that rely on algebra and calculus principles. The differentiating character of deep learning is that the algorithm uses a neural network to extract features of the input data and classify it based on patterns to provide output without needing manual input of definitions. The key aspect here is neural networks<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="neural networks" id="id209" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>. The idea of neural networks comes from the fact that they mimic the way the brain functions, as a multilayer system that performs mathematical calculations. Layered with multiple levels of algorithms designed to detect patterns, neural networks interpret data by reviewing and labeling its output. If we consider our fruit example, instead of having to provide the attributes of what each fruit looks like, we have to feed many images of the fruits into the deep learning model. The images will be processed, and the model will create definitions such as the shapes, sizes, and colors. </p>

            <dt class="calibre10">Natural language processing (NLP)</dt>
            <dd class="calibre11">
              <p class="subtitle">NLP<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="natural language processing (NLP)" id="id210" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> combines computational linguistics (rule-based modeling of human language) with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. These kinds of models were initially available only in English (e.g., BERT from Google AI), but the current trend is to create local versions or multilanguage models<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="multilanguage NLP models" id="id211" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="local versions, NLP" id="id212" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> to support others like Spanish, Chinese, French, etc. That said, NLP has undergone a tremendous evolution in the last 20 years. NLP algorithms used to be task-specific, but modern architectures have allowed them to better generalize to different tasks and even to gain emerging capabilities that they were not trained for. From a Microsoft Azure perspective, both Azure OpenAI Service and <a href="https://oreil.ly/b191_" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Azure AI Language</a> resources<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Azure AI Language" id="id213" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> rely on NLP models. </p>

            <dd class="calibre11">
              <p class="subtitle">This is a set of technologies<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="robotic process automation (RPA)" id="id214" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> that replicates the manual interactions of human agents with visual interfaces. For example, imagine you are working in HR and you need to do the same task every week, which could be checking some information related to the employees via an internal platform, then filling out some information, and finally sending a customized email. RPA tools are easy to implement, reduce wasted time, and increase internal efficiencies, so employees can focus on added value tasks and avoid monotonous work.</p>

The University of Montreal <a href="https://oreil.ly/u_H5h" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">defines operations research</a> as “a field at the crossroads of computer science, applied mathematics, management, and industrial engineering. Its goal is to provide automated logic-based decision-making systems, generally for control or optimization tasks such as improving efficiency or reducing costs in industry.”</p>
              <p class="subtitle">OR usually relies on a set of variables and constraints that guide some sort of simulation that can be used for different kinds of planning activities: managing limited healthcare in hospitals, optimizing service schedules, planning energy use, planning public transit systems, etc.</p>

          <p class="subtitle">These are the main categories of AI technologies, but the list can change depending on the interpretation of what AI means. Regardless of the details, it is important to keep in mind these technologies as a set of capabilities to predict, interpret, optimize, etc. based on specific data inputs. Let’s see now how these different AI technologies apply to all sorts of use cases, which are likely to leverage one technology or combine them depending on the implementation approach<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_artificialintelligenceAItechnologiesof11872" id="id216" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>.</p>

          <h2 class="calibre21">Typical AI Use Cases</h2>
          <p class="subtitle">Regardless of the level of technical complexity, there are many different kinds of AI implementations<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="artificial intelligence (AI)" data-secondary="typical use cases" id="xi_artificialintelligenceAItypicalusecases146115" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>, and their usefulness usually depends on the specific use cases that organizations decide to implement. For example, one organization might say, “we would like to get automatic notifications when there is a specific pattern from our billing figures” and develop some basic anomaly detection model, or even a basic rule-based one, and this could be considered an AI. Others will require more advanced developments (including generative AI), but they will need to have a business justification behind it. </p>
          <p class="subtitle">Before we explore the technical and business considerations for an adopter company, here are some examples of AI-enabled applications:</p>
          <dl class="stafflist">

They are based on NLP/linguistic capabilities that allow them (with different levels of success) to understand the intent of what a client wants or needs, so they can provide them with an initial answer or hints to find the final answer. They also reduce the burden on support folks to answer initial requests, as chatbots can analyze, filter, and dispatch cases depending on the topic. The main advantage is automation and scalability of business activities (i.e., doing more with less), but there are challenges related to how efficient chatbots are for complex tasks and information. That said, chatbots are exponentially evolving with the arrival of generative AI, going from traditional rule-based engines to dynamic assistants that can adapt to the context of the discussion.</p>

We can learn by ourselves, based on our own positive or negative experiences. We can also learn from the advice of adult humans, who previously learned from their own experience; this can help us accelerate our own learning process. AI models are very similar, and the way to leverage previous experiences (in this case data and models) depends on the type of AI model learning approach, as you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_1_ai_model_learning_categories" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Figure 1-1</a>.</p>

          <p class="subtitle">Generative AI is here to stay, and Azure OpenAI Service is already a key factor for adoption and democratization.

        <h1 class="calibre4">About Generative AI</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">The term “generative AI<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="generative AI" id="xi_generativeAI112435" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>” refers to the field of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating models and systems that have the ability to generate new content, such as images, text, music, videos, diagrams, etc.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">As you may already know, this term has gained a lot of relevance in recent years, but it is not new. We can talk about probabilistic models in the 1990s, such as latent variable models and graphical models, which aimed to capture and generate data distribution. Also, recent advancements in deep learning<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="deep learning (DL)" id="id247" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="DL (deep learning)" id="id248" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>, specifically in the form of generative adversarial networks (GANs)<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="generative adversarial networks (GANs)" id="id249" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> and variational autoencoders (VAEs)<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="variational autoencoders (VAEs)" id="id250" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>, have significantly contributed to the popularization and advancement of generative AI.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">The term “generative AI” has gained momentum as researchers, companies, and practitioners begin to explore the potential of these techniques to generate realistic and creative outputs. The result is now obvious, as AI encompasses a wide range of applications and techniques, including image synthesis, text generation, music generation, etc. Obviously, this is an evolving field and both academia and industry continue to innovate.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">As you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_2_types_of_ai_capabilities" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Figure 1-2</a>, the generation capability can be seen as an extension of other existing types of AI techniques, which are more oriented to either describe, predict, or prescribe data patterns, or to optimize specific scenarios. Advanced AI techniques, including OR and generative AI, allow adopters to go from “only insights” to automated decision making and actions.</p>

        </div></figure>
        <p class="subtitle">From a technical point of view, these models work in a very particular way. Instead of “just” predicting a certain pattern for a data entry (e.g., forecasting the ideal insurance premium for a specific client), they generate several outcomes to a specific instruction. The interaction with the generative AI model happens in a question-answer fashion, and this includes both direct instructions from humans (based on natural language instructions) and automated actions.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">The term “prompt engineering<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="prompt engineering" id="id251" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>” has emerged more recently in the context of NLP<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="natural language processing (NLP)" data-secondary="prompt engineering" id="id252" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> and the development of language models. While there isn’t a specific origin or a definitive moment when the term was coined, it has gained popularity as a way to describe the process of designing and refining prompts to elicit desired responses from language models.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Prompt engineering involves carefully crafting the instructions or input provided to a language model to achieve the desired output. It includes selecting the right wording, structure, and context to guide the model toward generating the desired response or completing a specific task. There are ongoing efforts to develop systematic approaches for designing effective prompts, fine-tuning models for specific tasks, and mitigating biases or undesired behaviors in language generation.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">From the previously mentioned question-answer dynamic<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="question-answer dynamic" data-seealso="prompt engineering" id="id253" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="completion" id="id254" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>, as you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_3_prompts_and_completions" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Figure 1-3</a>, <em class="hyperlink">prompt</em> is the question, and the answer is called <em class="hyperlink">completion</em>. The term “completion” in the context of NLP and language models refers to the generation or prediction of text that completes a given prompt or input, and it became more widely used as larger and more powerful models like OpenAI’s GPT were developed. In summary, the term “completion” in language models emerged from the evolving field of language modeling, reflecting the ability of models to generate or predict text that fills in or completes a given context or prompt.</p>

        <p class="subtitle">Generative AI is a new kind of artificial intelligence, and its main advantage for wide adoption is the ability to enable communication between users and the generative AI models via natural language prompts and completions. That’s a game changer, but let’s see now the main kind of capabilities we can get from these models.</p>

          <h2 class="calibre21">The Key Role of Foundation Models</h2>
          <p class="subtitle">There are several reasons generative AI is a total disruption<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="generative AI" data-secondary="foundation models, role of" id="id324" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="foundation models, role in generative AI" id="id325" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="models" data-secondary="foundation" id="id326" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>. The perception of a never-seen level of performance is one of them. The ability to interact using plain language to send our instructions and to interpret the results is another one. However, one of the fundamental aspects for generative AI to deliver the value we see nowadays is the notion of <em class="hyperlink">foundation models</em>.</p>
          <p class="subtitle">Foundation models are base models pre-trained with a vast amount of information (e.g., LLMs) that are able to perform very different tasks. This is something new as traditional AI/NLP models focus on unitary tasks, one specific model per task (e.g., language translation).</p>
          <p class="subtitle">For example, Azure OpenAI models such as GPT-4 and GPT-4o can do plenty of things by leveraging one single model. They can perform diverse tasks related to a specific generative capability, such as text/language, and help you analyze, generate, summarize, translate, classify, etc., all with only one model. In addition to that, if the models are able to handle different kinds of inputs at the same time, like text and image, they qualify<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="multimodal models" id="id327" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="models" data-secondary="multimodal" id="id328" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> as <em class="hyperlink">multimodal models</em> (e.g., <a href="https://oreil.ly/kDBF5" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">GPT-4V</a>). You can see the main differences in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_5_traditional_ai_versus_foundation_models" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Figure 1-5</a>.</p>
          <p class="subtitle">This flexible approach provides multiple options for the development of new use cases, and you will see later (in Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch02.html#designing_cloud_native_architectures_for_generativ" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">2</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch03.html#implementing_cloud_native_generative_ai_with_azure" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">3</a>) how Azure OpenAI facilitates the configuration, testing, and deployment of these foundation models. But what does it represent in terms of AI disruption? Let’s see first one of the fundamental reasons why generative AI and companies such as OpenAI got so much attention in recent years.</p>

          <h2 class="calibre21">Road to Artificial General Intelligence </h2>
          <p class="subtitle">Before we dig into the core part of this book, it’s important to contextualize all these innovations within the general state of artificial intelligence<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="artificial general intelligence (AGI)" id="xi_artificialgeneralintelligenceAGI1320166" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>, and the current discussions on <em class="hyperlink">artificial general intelligence</em> (AGI) due to the unexpected capabilities of GPT-4 and other LLMs.</p>
          <p class="subtitle">You may remember some cinematographic references to what a lot of people imagine as artificial intelligence—Skynet, Ultron, <em class="hyperlink">I, Robot</em>, etc. All of them showed some sort of superior intelligence, usually represented by strong and dangerous humanoid robots that evolve over time, and that plan somehow to replace or even destroy the human race. Well, even if it is not the purpose of this book to show a naive vision of what AI and its capabilities are, we will start by demystifying and clarifying the current level of development of artificial intelligence, so everyone can understand where we are and what the realistic expectations of an AI system are. For that purpose, here are three types of AI depending on their scope and level of intelligence:</p>
          <dl class="stafflist">
            <dt class="calibre10">Narrow AI</dt>
            <dd class="calibre11">
              <p class="subtitle">The current<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="narrow AI" id="id329" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> type of capabilities that AI systems and technologies are offering. Basically, this is an AI that can get a relatively big sample of past data, and then generate predictions based on that, for very specific tasks, for example, detecting objects from new images, recognizing people from audio voices, etc. </p>

            <dt class="calibre10">General AI (or artificial general intelligence)</dt>

              <p class="subtitle">The next goal for AI researchers and companies. The idea is to generalize the training process and the knowledge it generates for AI and leverage that within other domains. For example, how can we make an AI-enabled personal assistant aware of the changing context? And then adapt previous learnings to new situations? This is not 100% feasible today, but likely to happen at some point.</p>
            </dd>

Its capabilities (cognitive, physical, etc.) are far superior to humans, and it can in theory surpass them. However, this kind of super intelligence is currently a futuristic vision of what an artificial intelligence could be. It’s still not feasible and probably will not happen in the upcoming years or even decades (this opinion will be different depending on who you ask).</p>

          </dl>
          <p class="subtitle">Bringing this back to the topic of generative AI, current discussions focus on the current stage or type of artificial intelligence. But the real question is, are we still talking about narrow AI? Are we getting closer to general AI? It is a fair question given the new level of performance and flexibility of foundation models to perform a variety of tasks. Regardless of the answer (which can go from the technical to the philosophical), reality is that generative AI in general, and Azure OpenAI Service in particular, are delivering capabilities we never dreamt about before. </p>
          <p class="subtitle">There was an <a href="https://oreil.ly/rhEVW" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">early analysis of the GPT-4 model</a> capabilities from the Microsoft team that explored this relation between the foundation models, and talks about “close to human-level performance” and an “early version of an AGI system.” Also, companies like OpenAI have declared the <a href="https://oreil.ly/vTgyJ" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">pursuit of AGI</a> as one of their main goals.</p>
          <p class="subtitle">We have covered all the fundamentals related to generative AI topics, including evolution from traditional AI, recent developments, and ongoing discussions around performance and the impact of generative AI.

          <p class="subtitle">In this case, generative AI has adopted the notion of <em class="hyperlink">tokens</em>, which is a <a href="https://oreil.ly/Vy9ny" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">set of words or characters</a> in which we split the text-based information.

          <p class="subtitle">The specific amount of tokens depends on the number of words (other providers calculate tokens based on characters, instead of words), but also on their length and language. The general rule is 1,000 tokens is approximately 750 words for the English language, but OpenAI explains the <a href="https://oreil.ly/tMYF_" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">specific way</a> to calculate tokens depending on the case.

        <p class="subtitle">This first chapter was a mix of intro-level information related to AI and generative AI and a preliminary introduction to Azure OpenAI topics, including recent developments, primary capabilities, typical use cases, and its value as an AI copilot enabler for your own generative AI developments.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Depending on your background, this information may be just a 101 introduction, but the concepts behind the Azure OpenAI Service, even if they are new and include some new terms, can be as simple as it looks—a managed PaaS that will allow you to deploy your own cloud native, generative AI solutions<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_artificialintelligenceAI1328" id="id381" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">In <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#designing_cloud_native_architectures_for_generativ" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Chapter 2</a>, we will analyze the potential scenarios for cloud native development, their connection with Azure OpenAI, and the architectural requirements that will help you prepare everything, before even implementing your Azure OpenAI–enabled solutions. As with this chapter, if you already have some preliminary knowledge of cloud native and Azure architectures, you may read it as a way to connect the dots and understand the specifics of these topics adapted to generative AI. If you are totally new to the topic, feel free to read the content and explore any external resource that may support your upskilling journey. We’re just getting started!</p>
