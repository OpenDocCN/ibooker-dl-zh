  zh: 3.1 大型语言模型操作简介
- en: What is large language model operations (LLMOps)? Well, since we like to focus
    on practicality over rhetoric, we’re not going to dive into any fancy definitions
    that you’d expect in a textbook, but let’s simply say it’s machine learning operations
    (MLOps) that have been scaled to handle LLMs. Let us also say scaling up is hard.
    One of the hardest tasks in software engineering. Unfortunately, too many companies
    are running rudimentary MLOps setups, and don’t think for a second that they will
    be able to handle LLMs. That said, the term *LLMOps* may not be needed. It has
    yet to show through as sufficiently different from core MLOps, especially considering
    they still have the same bones. If this book were a dichotomous key, MLOps and
    LLMOps would definitely be in the same genus, and only time will tell whether
    they are the same species. Of course, by refusing to define LLMOps properly, we
    might have traded one confusion for another, so let’s take a minute to describe
    MLOps.

  zh: 什么是大型语言模型操作（LLMOps）？嗯，既然我们更喜欢关注实用性而非辞藻，我们就不会深入探讨那些你在教科书中可能会期待的任何花哨的定义，但让我们简单地说，它是指扩展到处理大型语言模型（LLMs）的机器学习操作（MLOps）。我们还可以说，扩展是困难的。软件工程中最困难的任务之一。不幸的是，太多公司正在运行基本的MLOps设置，并且他们绝对无法处理LLMs的想法。话虽如此，*LLMOps*这个术语可能并不需要。它还没有显示出与核心MLOps有足够的区别，尤其是考虑到它们仍然有相同的结构。如果这本书是一个二分法的关键，MLOps和LLMOps肯定属于同一属，而只有时间才能告诉我们它们是否是同一物种。当然，通过拒绝正确地定义LLMOps，我们可能已经将一种困惑换成了另一种困惑，所以让我们花一分钟来描述一下MLOps。
- en: MLOps is the field and practice of reliably and efficiently deploying and maintaining
    machine learning models in production. This includes—and, indeed, requires—managing
    the entire machine learning life cycle, from data acquisition and model training
    to monitoring and termination. A few principles required to master this field
    include workflow orchestration, versioning, feedback loops, continuous integration
    and continuous deployment (CI/CD), security, resource provisioning, and data governance.
    While there are often personnel who specialize in the productionizing of models,
    with titles like ML Engineers, MLOps Engineers, or ML Infrastructure Engineer,
    the field is a large-enough beast that it often abducts many other unsuspecting
    professionals to work in it who hold titles like Data Scientist or DevOps Engineer—often
    against their knowledge or will, leaving them kicking and screaming, “It’s not
    my job.”

    just another fad opportunists throw on their resume? Not quite. In fact, it’s
    quite similar to the term *Big Data*. When the term was at its peak popularity,
    people with titles like Big Data Engineer used completely different tool sets
    and developed specialized expertise necessary to handle large datasets. LLMs come
    with a set of challenges and problems you won’t find with traditional machine
    learning systems. A majority of these problems extend almost exclusively because
    they are so big. Large models are large! We hope to show you that LLMs truly earn
    their name. Let’s take a look at a few of these challenges so we can appreciate
    the task ahead of us when we start talking about deploying an LLM.

    comparison, *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, one of the largest games at the time
    of this writing, is 235 GB. *Final Fantasy 15* is only 148 GB, so you could fit
    two into the model with plenty of room to spare. It’s just hard to really comprehend
    how massive LLMs are. We went from 100 million parameters in models like BERT
    and took them to billions of parameters. If you went on a shopping spree and spent
    $20 a second (or maybe accidentally left your AWS EC2 instance on), it’d take

    the model under the best conditions. You’re equipped with a gigabit speed fiber
    internet connection, and you’re magically able to dedicate the entire bandwidth
    and I/O operations of your system and the server to it. It will still take over

    That might work for small sklearn regression models, but it isn’t going to work

    systems and throw it out the window (but thankfully not too far). Most modern-day
    best practices for software engineering assume you can easily restart an application
    if anything happens, and there’s a lot of rigmarole involved to ensure your systems
    can do just that. With LLMs, it can take seconds to shut down, but potentially
    hours to redeploy, making this a semi-irreversible process. Like picking an apple
    off a tree, it’s easy to pluck one off, but if you bite into it and decide it’s
    too sour, you can’t reattach it to the tree so it can continue to ripen. You’ll

    This is obvious when stated, but more parameters equate to more computations,
    and more computations mean longer inference wait times. However, this can’t be
    underestimated. We know many people who downplay the latency problems because
    they’ve interacted with an LLM chatbot, and the experience felt smooth. Take a
    second look, though, and you’ll notice that it is returning one word at a time,
    which is streamed to the user. It feels smooth because the answers are coming
    in faster than a human can read, but a second look helps us realize this is just
    a UX trick. LLMs are still too slow to be very useful for an autocomplete solution,
    for example, where responses have to be blazingly fast. Building it into a data
    pipeline or workflow that reads a large corpus of text and then tries to clean
    it or summarize it may also be too prohibitively slow to be useful or reliable.

  zh: 模型尺寸的增加通常伴随着推理延迟的增加。这一点说出来很明显，但更多的参数意味着更多的计算，更多的计算意味着更长的推理等待时间。然而，这一点不能被低估。我们知道很多人轻视延迟问题，因为他们与一个LLM聊天机器人互动过，感觉体验很流畅。但如果你仔细观察，你会发现它一次只返回一个单词，这些单词被流式传输给用户。之所以感觉流畅，是因为答案的到来速度超过了人类阅读的速度，但仔细观察有助于我们意识到这只是一个UX技巧。LLMs仍然太慢，对于需要快速响应的自动补全解决方案等用途来说，仍然不太有用。将其构建到读取大量文本数据的数据管道或工作流程中，然后尝试清理或总结它，也可能因为速度过慢而无法使用或可靠。
- en: There are also many less obvious reasons for their slowness. For starters, LLMs
    are often distributed across multiple GPUs, which adds extra communication overhead.
    As discussed later in this chapter in section 3.3.2, they are distributed in other
    ways, often even to improve latency, but any distribution adds an additional overhead
    burden. In addition, LLMs’ latency is severely affected by completion length,
    meaning the more words it uses to return a response, the longer it takes. Of course,
    completion length also seems to improve accuracy. For example, using prompt engineering
    techniques like chain of thought (CoT), we ask the model to think about a problem
    in a step-by-step fashion, which has been shown to improve results for logic and
    math questions but significantly increases the response length and latency time.

    the hood. For many who are stepping into the realm of LLMs, this requires utilizing
    a new resource and extra complexity. Many brazenly step into this world, acting

- en: 'A big challenge for those new to working with LLMs is dealing with the token
    limits. The token limit for a model is the maximum number of tokens that can be
    included as an input for a model. The larger the token limit, the more context
    we can give the model to improve its success at accomplishing the task. Everyone
    wants them to be higher, but it’s not that simple. These token limits are defined
    by two problems: the memory and speed our GPUs have access to and the nature of
    memory storage in the models themselves.'

  zh: 对于LLM新用户来说，一个很大的挑战是处理标记限制。模型的标记限制是指可以作为模型输入的最大标记数量。标记限制越大，我们可以提供给模型的上下文就越多，从而提高其完成任务的成功率。每个人都希望它们更高，但这并不简单。这些标记限制由两个问题定义：我们GPU可访问的内存和速度，以及模型自身内存存储的性质。
- en: 'The first problem seems unintuitive: Why couldn’t we just increase the GPU
    memory? The answer is complex. We can, but stacking more layers in the GPU to
    take into account more gigabytes at once slows down the GPU’s computational ability
    as a whole. Right now, GPU manufacturers are working on new architectures and
    ways to get around this problem. The second challenge is fascinating because increasing
    the token limits actually exacerbates the mathematical problems under the hood.
    Let me explain. Memory storage within an LLM itself isn’t something we think about
    often. We call that mechanism *attention*, which we discussed in depth in section
    2.2.7\. What we didn’t discuss was that attention is a quadratic solution: as
    the number of tokens increases, the number of calculations required to compute
    the attention scores between all the pairs of tokens in a sequence scales quadratically
    with the sequence length. In addition, within our gigantic context spaces, and
    since we are dealing with quadratics, we’re starting to hit problems where the
    only solutions involve imaginary numbers, which can cause models to behave in
    unexpected ways. This is likely one of the reasons why LLMs hallucinate.'

- en: 'These problems have real implications and affect application designs. For example,
    when this author’s team upgraded from GPT-3 to GPT-4, the team was excited to
    have access to a higher token limit, but it soon found this led to longer inference
    times and, subsequently, a higher timeout error rate. In the real world, it’s
    often better to get a less accurate response quickly than to get no response at
    all because the promise of a more accurate model often is just that: a promise.
    Of course, when deploying it locally, where you don’t have to worry about response
    times, you’ll likely find your hardware to be a limiting factor. For example,
    LLaMA was trained with 2,048 tokens, but you’ll be lucky to take advantage of
    more than 512 of that when running with a basic consumer GPU, as you are likely
    to see out-of-memory (OOM) errors or even the model simply crashing.'

    byte stream, often injecting malware over the wire when the model is transferred
    over an insecure network. This is especially concerning for large models that
    take a long time to download, as it makes it easier for a third party to intercept
    the transfer and inject malicious code. If this happens, the code injected can
    potentially give the attackers access to your system. This can happen when attempting
    to use the model during inference, as the harmful code will execute if it is not

    have asked yourself something akin to “If the biggest problems from LLMs come
    from their size, why don’t we just make them smaller?” If you did, congratulations!
    You are a genius—compression is the practice of doing just that. Compressing models
    to as small as we can make them will improve deployment time, reduce latency,
    scale down the number of expensive GPUs needed, and, ultimately, save money. However,
    the whole point of making the models so stupefyingly gargantuan in the first place
    was because it made them better at what they do. We need to be able to shrink
    them without losing all the progress we made by making them big in the first place.

    Pulling out a ruler and measuring his pencil, you wouldn’t believe him if he stated
    the length was 19.025467821973739 cm. Even if he used a caliper, he couldn’t verify
    a number so precisely. With our ruler, any number beyond 19.03 cm is fantasy.

    a single bit. To improve this range, we combine multiple bits and assign them
    different meanings. String 8 of them together, and you get a byte. Using the INT8
    standard, we can take that byte and encode all the integers from –128 to 127\.
    We’ll spare you the particulars because we assume you already know how binary
    works; suffice it to say, the more bits we have, the larger range of numbers we
    can represent, both larger and smaller. Figure 3.1 shows a few common floating
    point encodings. With 32 bits strung together, we get what we pretentiously term
    *full precision*, and that is how most numbers are stored, including the weights
    in machine learning models. Basic quantization moves us from full precision to
    half precision, shrinking models to half their size. There are two different half
    precision standards, FP16 and BF16, which differ in how many bits represent the
    range or exponent part. Since BF16 uses the same number of exponents as FP32,
    it’s been found to be more effective for quantizing, and you can generally expect
    almost exactly the same level of accuracy for half the size of model. If you understood

    into a bottle, and it’s no small feat. If you study the weights in your model,
    you might notice that most of the numbers are fractions between [–1, 1]. We could
    take advantage of this by using an 8-bit standard that represents more values
    in this region in a non-uniform way instead of the standard uniform [–128, 127].
    While mathematically possible, unfortunately, any such standards aren’t commonplace,
    and modern-day deep learning hardware and software are not designed to take advantage
    of them. So for now, it’s best to stick to uniform quantization.

    to match our new number range. We would then bucket all the other numbers based
    on where they fall. Of course, if we have really large outliers, we may find all
    our other numbers squeezed into just one or two buckets, ruining any granularity
    we once had. To prevent this, we can clip any large numbers; this is what we do
    in static quantization. However, before we clip the data, what if we choose a
    range and scale that captures the majority of our data beforehand? We need to
    be careful since if this dynamic range is too small, we will introduce more clipping
    errors; if it’s too big, we will introduce more rounding errors. The goal of dynamic
    quantization is, of course, to reduce both errors.

    we force the data to be normal and thus symmetric; however, we could choose to

- en: As a last resort, if none of these other methods fail to reduce the accuracy
    loss of the model, we can use quantization-aware training (QAT). QAT is a simple
    process where we add a fake quantization step during model training. By fake,
    we mean we clip and round the data while leaving it in full precision. This allows
    the model to adjust for the error and bias introduced by quantization while it’s

    parallelizing in a cluster and spinning up loads of processes is a breeze. Second,
    different dimensions have different multiplicity costs. For example, column parallelism
    requires us to send the entire dataset to each process but with the benefit of
    concatenating them together at the end, which is fast and easy. Row parallelism,
    however, allows us to break up the dataset into chunks but requires us to add
    the results, a more expensive operation than concatenating. You can see that one
    operation is more I/O bound, while the other is more computation bound. Ultimately,
    the best dimension will be dataset dependent and hardware limited. It will require

    matters because our model is too big; we can’t fit it into a single GPU’s memory
    to even get it to run. That’s where pipeline parallelism comes in; it’s the process
    of splitting up a model vertically and putting each part onto a different GPU.
    This creates a pipeline, as input data will go to the first GPU, process, then
    transfer to the next GPU, and so on until it’s run through the entire model. While
    other parallelism techniques improve our processing power and speed up inference,
    pipeline parallelism is required to get it to run. However, it comes with some
    major downsides, mainly device utilization.

  zh: 到目前为止，我们可以运行大量数据并加速任何瓶颈，但这些都无关紧要，因为我们的模型太大；我们无法将其放入单个GPU的内存中，甚至无法让它运行。这就是管道并行派上用场的地方；它是指将模型垂直分割并分别将每个部分放到不同的GPU上的过程。这创建了一个管道，因为输入数据将流向第一个GPU，进行处理，然后传输到下一个GPU，依此类推，直到整个模型运行完毕。虽然其他并行技术可以提高我们的处理能力和加速推理，但需要管道并行才能使其运行。然而，它伴随着一些主要的缺点，主要是设备利用率。
- en: To understand where this downside comes from and how to mitigate it, let’s first
    consider the naive approach to this, where we simply run all the data at once
    through the model. We find that this leaves a giant “bubble” of underutilization.
    Since the model is broken up, we have to process everything sequentially through
    the devices. This means that while one GPU is processing, the others are sitting
    idle. In figure 3.6, we can see this naive approach and a large bubble of inactivity
    as the GPUs sit idle. We also see a better way to take advantage of each device.
    We do this by sending the data in small batches. A smaller batch allows the first
    GPU to pass on what it was working on quicker and move on to another batch. This
    allows the next device to get started earlier and reduces the size of the bubble.

    we see the devices sitting idle 75% of the time! GPUs are quite expensive to allow
    to sit idle three quarters of the time. Let’s see what that looks like using the
    microbatch strategy. With a microbatch of 4, it cuts this almost in half, down
    to just 43% of the time. We can glean from this formula that the more GPUs we
    have, the higher the idle times, but the more microbatches, the better the utilization.

- en: 'Unfortunately, we often can neither reduce the number of GPUs nor make the
    microbatches as large as we want. There are limits. For GPUs, we have to use as
    many as it takes to fit the model into memory. However, try to use a few larger
    GPUs, as this will lead to more optimal utilization than using many smaller GPUs.
    Reducing the bubble in pipeline parallelism is another reason why compression
    is so important. For microbatching, the first limit is obvious: since the microbatch
    is a fraction of our batch size, we are limited by how big that is. The second
    is that each microbatch increases the memory demand for cached activations in
    a linear relationship. One way to counter this higher memory demand is a method
    called PipeDream.[^(12)](#footnote-130) There are different configurations and
    approaches, but the basic idea is the same. In this method, we start working on
    the backward pass as soon as we’ve finished the forward pass of any of the microbatches.

    PipeDream 的方法。[^(12)](#footnote-130) 存在不同的配置和方法，但基本思想是相同的。在此方法中，我们在完成任何微批量的正向传递后立即开始工作反向传递。这使得我们能够完全完成一个训练周期并释放该微批量的缓存。

    data, tensor, and pipeline parallelism (DP + TP + PP) together. Since each technique
    and, thus, dimension will require at least two GPUs to run 3D parallelism, we’ll
    need at least eight GPUs to get started. How we configure these GPUs will be important
    to get the most efficiency out of this process. Because TP has the largest communication
    overhead, we want to ensure these GPUs are close together, preferably on the same
    node and machine. PP has the least communication volume of the three, so breaking

    we see that PP can perform well even with small batch sizes due to the reduced
    effective batch size enabled by TP. This combination also improves the communication
    between DP nodes at different pipeline stages, allowing DP to work effectively
    too. The communication bandwidth between nodes is proportional to the number of
    pipeline stages. Consequently, DP can scale well even with smaller batch sizes.
    Overall, we see that when running in combination, we get better performance than

    of what you care about is going to be in the experiment tracker, so you can usually
    get away with simply ensuring you can link the two. In fact, most model registries

    could speculate on the many reasons for this, but none of them are worthy of note.
    Speaking of limit sizes, if you are going to be running your model registry on
    an on-premise storage system like Ceph, make sure it has lots of space. You can
    buy multiple terabytes of storage for a couple of hundred dollars for your on-premise
    servers, but even a couple of terabytes fills up quickly when your LLM is over
    300 GB. Don’t forget: you are likely to be keeping multiple checkpoints and versions
    during training and finetuning, as well as duplicates for reliability purposes.
    Storage is still one of the cheapest aspects of running LLMs, though, so there’s

    GB时也会很快填满。别忘了：在训练和微调过程中，你很可能会保留多个检查点和版本，以及用于可靠性的副本。然而，存储仍然是运行LLMs成本最低的部分，所以在这里节省开支并导致未来头疼是没有理由的。

    massive headaches when going to production because getting this type of feature
    in real time can be anything but easy. Feature store abstractions help minimize
    this burden. Related to this are feature store point-in-time retrievals, which
    are table stakes when talking feature stores. Point-in-time retrievals ensure
    that, given a specific time, a query will always return the same result. This
    is important because features like averages over “the last 30 seconds” are constantly
    changing, so this allows us to version the data (without the extra burden of a
    bloated versioning system), as well as ensure our models will give accurate and

    additional context. Just give the model the user’s query, and let the model do
    its thing. However, this approach is still a bit naive, and we haven’t quite gotten
    to a point where LLMs are completely self-sufficient. To avoid hallucinations
    and improve factual correctness, it is often best to give the model some context.

- en: GPU-enabled workstations and remote workstations in general are often considered
    a nice-to-have or luxury by many teams, but when working with LLMs, that mindset
    has to change. When troubleshooting a problem or just developing a model in general,
    a data scientist isn’t able to spin up the model in a notebook on their laptop
    anymore. The easiest way to solve this is to simply provide remote workstations
    with GPU resources. There are plenty of cloud solutions for this, but if your
    company is working mainly on-premise, it may be a bit more difficult to provide
    but necessary nonetheless.

- en: LLMs are GPU memory-intensive models. Consequently, there are some numbers every
    engineer should know when it comes to working in the field. The first is how many
    GPUs to have. The NVIDIA Tesla T4 and V100 are the two most common GPUs you’ll
    find in a datacenter, but they only have 16 GB of memory. They are workhorses,
    though, and cost-effective, so if we can compress our model to run on these, all
    the better. After these, you’ll find a range of GPUs like NVIDIA A10G, NVIDIA
    Quadro series, and NVIDIA RTX series that offer GPU memories in the ranges of
    24, 32, and 48 GB. All of these are fine upgrades; you’ll just have to figure
    out which ones are offered by your cloud provider and available to you. This brings
    us to the NVIDIA A100, which is likely going to be your GPU of choice when working
    with LLMs. Thankfully, they are relatively common and offer two different models
    providing 40 or 80 GB. A big problem with these is that they are constantly in
    high demand by everyone right now. You should also be aware of the NVIDIA H100,
    which offers 80 GB like the A100\. The H100 NVL is promised to support up to 188
    GB and has been designed with LLMs in mind. Another new GPU you should be aware
    of is the NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPU, which has 24 GB and is positioned to take
    over as a new workhorse along with the T4 and V100, at least as far as AI workloads
    are concerned.

  zh: 大型语言模型（LLMs）对GPU内存的需求很大。因此，在处理这个领域的工作时，每个工程师都应该了解一些数字。首先是要拥有多少个GPU。NVIDIA Tesla
    T4和V100是在数据中心中最常见的两种GPU，但它们只有16 GB的内存。尽管如此，它们是工作马，而且性价比高，所以如果我们能将这些模型压缩到这些GPU上运行，那就更好了。在这些之后，你会看到一系列的GPU，如NVIDIA
    A10G、NVIDIA Quadro系列和NVIDIA RTX系列，它们提供的GPU内存范围在24、32和48 GB之间。所有这些都是很好的升级；你只需要确定你的云服务提供商提供了哪些，并且这些是否可供你使用。这让我们来到了NVIDIA
    A100，当你与LLMs一起工作时，它很可能是你的首选GPU。幸运的是，它们相对常见，提供两种不同型号，分别提供40或80 GB的内存。这些GPU的一个大问题是它们目前的需求量非常大。你还应该了解NVIDIA
    H100，它提供80 GB的内存，就像A100一样。H100 NVL承诺支持高达188 GB，并且是为LLMs设计的。另一个你应该了解的新GPU是NVIDIA
    L4 Tensor Core GPU，它有24 GB的内存，并定位为T4和V100之后的新的工作马，至少在AI工作负载方面是这样的。
- en: 'LLMs come in all different sizes, and it’s useful to have a horse sense for
    what these numbers mean. For example, the LLaMA model has 7B, 13B, 33B, and 65B
    parameter variants. If you aren’t sure off the top of your head which GPU you
    need to run which model, here’s a shortcut: multiply the number of billions of
    parameters by two, and that’s how much GPU memory you need. The reason is that
    most models at inference will default to run at half precision, FP16 of BF16,
    which means we need at least 2 bytes for every parameter. For example, 7 billion
    × 2 bytes = 14 GB. You’ll need a little extra as well for the embedding model,
    which will be about another gigabyte, and more for the actual tokens you are running
    through the model. One token is about 1 MB, so 512 tokens will require 512 MB.
    This isn’t a big deal until you consider running larger batch sizes to improve
    performance. For 16 batches of this size, you’ll need an extra 8 GB of space.'

  zh: LLMs（大型语言模型）的大小各不相同，了解这些数字的含义很有用。例如，LLaMA模型有7B、13B、33B和65B参数变体。如果你不确定需要哪种GPU来运行哪种模型，这里有一个快捷方法：将参数的十亿数量乘以2，这就是你需要的GPU内存量。原因是大多数模型在推理时默认以半精度运行，即FP16或BF16，这意味着每个参数至少需要2个字节。例如，70亿
    × 2字节 = 14 GB。你还需要额外的空间来存储嵌入模型，这大约还需要另一个GB，以及更多用于模型中实际运行的标记。一个标记大约是1 MB，所以512个标记将需要512
    MB。这并不是什么大问题，直到你考虑运行更大的批量大小以提高性能。对于16个这样的批量，你将需要额外的8 GB空间。
- en: Of course, so far, we’ve only been talking about inference; for training, you’ll
    need a lot more space. While training, you’ll always want to do this in full precision,
    and you’ll need extra room for the optimizer tensors and gradients. In general,
    to account for this, you’ll need about 16 bytes for every parameter. So to train
    a 7B parameter model, you’ll want 112 GB of memory.
