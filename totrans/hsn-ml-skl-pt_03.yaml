    Building a model is probably not the end goal. How does the company expect to

    performance measure you will use to evaluate your model, and how much effort you
    will spend tweaking it.

    a given area. More specifically, your model’s output will be fed to another machine
    learning system (see [Figure 2-2](#house_pricing_pipeline_diagram)), along with
    some other signals.⁠^([2](ch02.html#id994)) So it’s important to make our housing
    price model as accurate as we can.

    where they manage to find out the actual median housing price, they often realize
    that their estimates were off by more than 30%. This is why the company thinks
    that it would be useful to train a model to predict a district’s median housing
    price, given other data about that district. The census data looks like a great
    dataset to exploit for this purpose, since it includes the median housing prices
    of thousands of districts, as well as other data.

    First, determine what kind of training supervision the model will need: is it
    a supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised, or reinforcement
    learning task? And is it a classification task, a regression task, or something
    else? Should you use batch learning or online learning techniques? Before you

  prefs: []

    learning task, since the model can be trained with *labeled* examples (each instance
    comes with the expected output, i.e., the district’s median housing price). It
    is a typical regression task, since the model will be asked to predict a value.
    More specifically, this is a *multiple regression* problem, since the system will
    use multiple features to make a prediction (the district’s population, the median
    income, etc.). It is also a *univariate regression* problem, since we are only
    trying to predict a single value for each district. If we were trying to predict
    multiple values per district, it would be a *multivariate regression* problem.
    Finally, there is no continuous flow of data coming into the system, there is
    no particular need to adjust to changing data rapidly, and the data is small enough
    to fit in memory, so plain batch learning should do just fine.

    For example, the district prices that your system outputs are going to be fed
    into a downstream machine learning system, and you assume that these prices are
    going to be used as such. But what if the downstream system converts the prices
    into categories (e.g., “cheap”, “medium”, or “expensive”) and then uses those
    categories instead of the prices themselves? In this case, getting the price perfectly
    right is not important at all; your system just needs to get the category right.
    If that’s so, then the problem should have been framed as a classification task,
    not a regression task. You don’t want to find this out after working on a regression
    system for months.

    `ISLAND           5` `Name: count, dtype: int64` [PRE3]`Let’s look at the other
    fields. The `describe()` method shows a summary of the numerical attributes ([Figure 2-7](#housing_describe_screenshot)).  ![A
    table generated by the `describe()` method, displaying statistical summaries for
    numerical attributes such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum,
    and percentiles.](assets/hmls_0207.png)  ###### Figure 2-7\. Summary of each numerical
    attribute    The `count`, `mean`, `min`, and `max` rows are self-explanatory.
    Note that the null values are ignored (so, for example, the `count` of `total_bedrooms`
    is 20,433, not 20,640). The `std` row shows the *standard deviation*, which measures
    how dispersed the values are.⁠^([5](ch02.html#id1038)) The `25%`, `50%`, and `75%`
    rows show the corresponding *percentiles*: a percentile indicates the value below
    which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For
    example, 25% of the districts have a `housing_median_age` lower than 18, while
    50% are lower than 29, and 75% are lower than 37\. These are often called the
    25th percentile (or first *quartile*), the median, and the 75th percentile (or
    third quartile).    Another quick way to get a feel of the type of data you are
    dealing with is to plot a histogram for each numerical attribute. A histogram
    shows the number of instances (on the vertical axis) that have a given value range
    (on the horizontal axis). You can either plot this one attribute at a time, or
    you can call the `hist()` method on the whole dataset (as shown in the following
    code example), and it will plot a histogram for each numerical attribute (see
    [Figure 2-8](#attribute_histogram_plots)).  ![Histograms displaying the distribution
    of various numerical attributes such as longitude, latitude, housing median age,
    total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, and median
    house value.](assets/hmls_0208.png)  ###### Figure 2-8\. A histogram for each
    numerical attribute    The number of value ranges can be adjusted using the `bins`
    argument (try playing with it to see how it affects the histograms):    [PRE4]    Looking
    at these histograms, you notice a few things:    *   First, the median income
    attribute does not look like it is expressed in US dollars (USD). After checking
    with the team that collected the data, you are told that the data has been scaled
    and capped at 15 (actually, 15.0001) for higher median incomes, and at 0.5 (actually,
    0.4999) for lower median incomes. The numbers represent roughly tens of thousands
    of dollars (e.g., 3 actually means about $30,000). Working with preprocessed attributes
    is common in machine learning, and it is not necessarily a problem, but you should
    try to understand how the data was computed.           *   The housing median
    age and the median house value were also capped. The latter may be a serious problem
    since it is your target attribute (your labels). Your machine learning algorithms
    may learn that prices never go beyond that limit. You need to check with your
    client team (the team that will use your system’s output) to see if this is a
    problem or not. If they tell you that they need precise predictions even beyond
    $500,000, then you have two options:               *   Collect proper labels for
    the districts whose labels were capped.                       *   Remove those
    districts from the training set (and also from the test set, since your system
    should not be evaluated poorly if it predicts values beyond $500,000).                   *   These
    attributes have very different scales. We will discuss this later in this chapter
    when we explore feature scaling.           *   Finally, many histograms are *skewed
    right*: they extend much farther to the right of the median than to the left.
    This may make it a bit harder for some machine learning algorithms to detect patterns.
    Later, you’ll try transforming these attributes to have more symmetrical and bell-shaped
    distributions.              You should now have a better understanding of the
    kind of data you’re dealing with.[PRE5]``  [PRE6][PRE7]py[PRE8] Well, this works,
    but it is not perfect: if you run the program again, it will generate a different
    test set! Over time, you (or your machine learning algorithms) will get to see
    the whole dataset, which is what you want to avoid.    One solution is to save
    the test set on the first run and then load it in subsequent runs. Another option
    is to set the random number generator’s seed (e.g., by passing `seed=42` to the
    `default_rng()` function)⁠^([6](ch02.html#id1054)) to ensure it always generates
    the same sequence of random numbers every time you run the program.    However,
    both these solutions will break the next time you fetch an updated dataset. To
    have a stable train/test split even after updating the dataset, a common solution
    is to use each instance’s identifier to decide whether it should go in the test
    set (assuming instances have unique and immutable identifiers). For example, you
    could compute a hash of each instance’s identifier and put that instance in the
    test set if the hash is lower than or equal to 20% of the maximum hash value.
    This ensures that the test set will remain consistent across multiple runs, even
    if you refresh the dataset. The new test set will contain 20% of the new instances,
    but it will not contain any instance that was previously in the training set.    Here
    is a possible implementation:    [PRE9]    Unfortunately, the housing dataset
    does not have an identifier column. The simplest solution is to use the row index
    as the ID:    [PRE10]    If you use the row index as a unique identifier, you
    need to make sure that new data gets appended to the end of the dataset and that
    no row ever gets deleted. If this is not possible, then you can try to use the
    most stable features to build a unique identifier. For example, a district’s latitude
    and longitude are guaranteed to be stable for a few million years, so you could
    combine them into an ID like so:⁠^([7](ch02.html#id1055))    [PRE11]    Scikit-Learn
    provides a few functions to split datasets into multiple subsets in various ways.
    The simplest function is `train_test_split()`, which does pretty much the same
    thing as the `shuffle_and_split_data()` function we defined earlier, with a couple
    of additional features. First, there is a `random_state` parameter that allows
    you to set the random generator seed. Second, you can pass it multiple datasets
    with an identical number of rows, and it will split them on the same indices (this
    is very useful, for example, if you have a separate DataFrame for labels):    [PRE12]    So
    far we have considered purely random sampling methods. This is generally fine
    if your dataset is large enough (especially relative to the number of attributes),
    but if it is not, you run the risk of introducing a significant sampling bias.
    When employees at a survey company decide to call 1,000 people to ask them a few
    questions, they don’t just pick 1,000 people randomly in a phone book. They try
    to ensure that these 1,000 people are representative of the whole population,
    with regard to the questions they want to ask. For example, according to the US
    Census Bureau, 51.6% of citizens of voting age are female, while 48.4% are male,
    so a well-conducted survey in the US would try to maintain this ratio in the sample:
    516 females and 484 males (at least if it seems likely that the answers may vary
    across genders). This is called *stratified sampling*: the population is divided
    into homogeneous subgroups called *strata*, and the right number of instances
    are sampled from each stratum to guarantee that the test set is representative
    of the overall population. If the people running the survey used purely random
    sampling, there would be over 10% chance of sampling a skewed test set with less
    than 49% female or more than 54% female participants. Either way, the survey results
    would likely be quite biased.    Suppose you’ve chatted with some experts who
    told you that the median income is a very important attribute to predict median
    housing prices. You may want to ensure that the test set is representative of
    the various categories of incomes in the whole dataset. Since the median income
    is a continuous numerical attribute, you first need to create an income category
    attribute. Let’s look at the median income histogram more closely (back in [Figure 2-8](#attribute_histogram_plots)):
    most median income values are clustered around 1.5 to 6 (i.e., $15,000–$60,000),
    but some median incomes go far beyond 6\. It is important to have a sufficient
    number of instances in your dataset for each stratum, or else the estimate of
    a stratum’s importance may be biased. This means that you should not have too
    many strata, and each stratum should be large enough. The following code uses
    the `pd.cut()` function to create an income category attribute with five categories
    (labeled from 1 to 5); category 1 ranges from 0 to 1.5 (i.e., less than $15,000),
    category 2 from 1.5 to 3, and so on:    [PRE13]    These income categories are
    represented in [Figure 2-9](#housing_income_cat_bar_plot):    [PRE14]    Now you
    are ready to do stratified sampling based on the income category. Scikit-Learn
    provides a number of splitter classes in the `sklearn.model_selection` package
    that implement various strategies to split your dataset into a training set and
    a test set. Each splitter has a `split()` method that returns an iterator over
    different training/test splits of the same data.  ![Bar chart illustrating the
    distribution of districts across five income categories, with categories two and
    three having the highest counts.](assets/hmls_0209.png)  ###### Figure 2-9\. Histogram
    of income categories    To be precise, the `split()` method yields the training
    and test *indices*, not the data itself. Having multiple splits can be useful
    if you want to better estimate the performance of your model, as you will see
    when we discuss cross-validation later in this chapter. For example, the following
    code generates 10 different stratified splits of the same dataset:    [PRE15]    For
    now, you can just use the first split:    [PRE16]    Or, since stratified sampling
    is fairly common, there’s a shorter way to get a single split using the `train_test_split()`
    function with the `stratify` argument:    [PRE17]    Let’s see if this worked
    as expected. You can start by looking at the income category proportions in the
    test set:    [PRE18]   [PRE19] for set_ in (strat_train_set, strat_test_set):     set_.drop("income_cat",
    axis=1, inplace=True) [PRE20]` [PRE21][PRE22][PRE23][PRE24][PRE25]  [PRE26]`py[PRE27]py

    far you have only taken a quick glance at the data to get a general understanding
    of the kind of data you are manipulating. Now the goal is to go into a little
    more depth.    First, make sure you have put the test set aside and you are only
    exploring the training set. Also, if the training set is very large, you may want
    to sample an exploration set, to make manipulations easy and fast during the exploration
    phase. In this case, the training set is quite small, so you can just work directly
    on the full set. Since you’re going to experiment with various transformations
    of the full training set, you should make a copy of the original so you can revert
    to it afterwards:    [PRE31]py    ## Visualizing Geographical Data    Because
    the dataset includes geographical information (latitude and longitude), it is
    a good idea to create a scatterplot of all the districts to visualize the data
    ([Figure 2-11](#bad_visualization_plot)):    [PRE32]py  ![Scatter plot displaying
    geographical data points with longitude on the x-axis and latitude on the y-axis,
    showing a distribution resembling California.](assets/hmls_0211.png)  ###### Figure
    2-11\. A geographical scatterplot of the data    This looks like California all
    right, but other than that it is hard to see any particular pattern. Setting the
    `alpha` option to `0.2` makes it much easier to visualize the places where there
    is a high density of data points ([Figure 2-12](#better_visualization_plot)):    [PRE33]py    Now
    that’s much better: you can clearly see the high-density areas, namely the Bay
    Area and around Los Angeles and San Diego, plus a long line of fairly high-density
    areas in the Central Valley (in particular, around Sacramento and Fresno).    Our
    brains are very good at spotting patterns in pictures, but you may need to play
    around with visualization parameters to make the patterns stand out.  ![Scatter
    plot showing the distribution of housing locations by latitude and longitude,
    illustrating high-density areas with darker blue clusters.](assets/hmls_0212.png)  ######
    Figure 2-12\. A better visualization that highlights high-density areas    Next,
    you look at the housing prices ([Figure 2-13](#housing_prices_scatterplot)). The
    radius of each circle represents the district’s population (option `s`), and the
    color represents the price (option `c`). Here you use a predefined color map (option
    `cmap`) called `jet`, which ranges from blue (low values) to red (high prices):⁠^([8](ch02.html#id1068))    [PRE34]py    This
    image tells you that the housing prices are very much related to the location
    (e.g., close to the ocean) and to the population density, as you probably knew
    already. A clustering algorithm should be useful for detecting the main cluster
    and for adding new features that measure the proximity to the cluster centers.
    The ocean proximity attribute may be useful as well, although in Northern California
    the housing prices in coastal districts are not too high, so it is not a simple
    rule.  ![Scatter plot showing California housing prices by location, with red
    indicating expensive areas and blue indicating cheaper ones; larger circles represent
    areas with larger population density.](assets/hmls_0213.png)  ###### Figure 2-13\.
    California housing prices: red is expensive, blue is cheap, larger circles indicate
    areas with a larger population    ## Look for Correlations    Since the dataset
    is not too large, you can easily compute the *standard correlation coefficient*
    (also called *Pearson’s r*) between every pair of numerical attributes using the
    `corr()` method:    [PRE35]py    Now you can look at how much each attribute correlates
    with the median house value:    [PRE36]py   [PRE37] ## Experiment with Attribute
    Combinations    Hopefully the previous sections gave you an idea of a few ways
    you can explore the data and gain insights. You identified a few data quirks that
    you may want to clean up before feeding the data to a machine learning algorithm,
    and you found interesting correlations between attributes, in particular with
    the target attribute. You also noticed that some attributes have a skewed-right
    distribution, so you may want to transform them (e.g., by computing their logarithm
    or square root). Of course, your mileage will vary considerably with each project,
    but the general ideas are similar.    One last thing you may want to do before
    preparing the data for machine learning algorithms is to try out various attribute
    combinations. For example, the total number of rooms in a district is not very
    useful if you don’t know how many households there are. What you really want is
    the number of rooms per household. Similarly, the total number of bedrooms by
    itself is not very useful: you probably want to compare it to the total number
    of rooms. And the population per household also seems like an interesting attribute
    combination to look at. You create these new attributes as follows:    [PRE38]    And
    then you look at the correlation matrix again:    [PRE39]   [PRE40] [PRE41][PRE42][PRE43][PRE44]`

    ## Handling Text and Categorical Attributes    So far we have only dealt with
    numerical attributes, but your data may also contain text attributes. In this
    dataset, there is just one: the `ocean_proximity` attribute. Let’s look at its
    value for the first few instances:    [PRE57]py   [PRE58]`py[PRE59]`py[PRE60]py[PRE61][PRE62][PRE63]py
    from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder  cat_encoder = OneHotEncoder()
    housing_cat_1hot = cat_encoder.fit_transform(housing_cat) [PRE64]py >>> housing_cat_1hot
    `<Compressed Sparse Row sparse matrix of dtype ''float64''`  `with 16512 stored
    elements and shape (16512, 5)>` [PRE65]py[PRE66]py[PRE67][PRE68] Pandas has a
    function called `get_dummies()`, which also converts each categorical feature
    into a one-hot representation, with one binary feature per category:    [PRE69]py   [PRE70]
    [PRE71][PRE72]``py[PRE73]`` [PRE74]`` But `OneHotEncoder` is smarter: it will
    detect the unknown category and raise an exception. If you prefer, you can set
    the `handle_unknown` hyperparameter to `"ignore"`, in which case it will just
    represent the unknown category with zeros:    [PRE75]   [PRE76]` [PRE77] ######
    Tip    If a categorical attribute has a large number of possible categories (e.g.,
    country code, profession, species), then one-hot encoding will result in a large
    number of input features. This may slow down training and degrade performance.
    If this happens, you may want to replace the categorical input with useful numerical
    features related to the categories: for example, you could replace the `ocean_proximity`
    feature with the distance to the ocean (similarly, a country code could be replaced
    with the country’s population and GDP per capita). Alternatively, you can use
    one of the encoders provided by the `category_encoders` package on [GitHub](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/category_encoders).
    Or, when dealing with neural networks, you can replace each category with a learnable,
    low-dimensional vector called an *embedding* (see [Chapter 14](ch14.html#nlp_chapter)).
    This is an example of *representation learning* (we will see more examples in
    [Chapter 18](ch18.html#autoencoders_chapter)).    When you fit any Scikit-Learn
    estimator using a DataFrame, the estimator stores the column names in the `feature_names_in_`
    attribute. Scikit-Learn then ensures that any DataFrame fed to this estimator
    after that (e.g., to `transform()` or `predict()`) has the same column names.
    Transformers also provide a `get_feature_names_out()` method that you can use
    to build a DataFrame around the transformer’s output:    [PRE78]py`` `array([''ocean_proximity_<1H
    OCEAN'', ''ocean_proximity_INLAND'',`  `''ocean_proximity_ISLAND'', ''ocean_proximity_NEAR
    BAY'',`  `''ocean_proximity_NEAR OCEAN''], dtype=object)` `>>>` `df_output` `=`

    ## Feature Scaling and Transformation    One of the most important transformations
    you need to apply to your data is *feature scaling*. With few exceptions, machine
    learning algorithms don’t perform well when the input numerical attributes have
    very different scales. This is the case for the housing data: the total number
    of rooms ranges from about 6 to 39,320, while the median incomes only range from
    0 to 15\. Without any scaling, most models will be biased toward ignoring the
    median income and focusing more on the number of rooms.    There are two common
    ways to get all attributes to have the same scale: *min-max scaling* and *standardization*.    ######
    Warning    As with all estimators, it is important to fit the scalers to the training
    data only: never use `fit()` or `fit_transform()` for anything else than the training
    set. Once you have a trained scaler, you can then use it to `transform()` any
    other set, including the validation set, the test set, and new data. Note that
    while the training set values will always be scaled to the specified range, if
    new data contains outliers, these may end up scaled outside the range. If you
    want to avoid this, just set the `clip` hyperparameter to `True`.    Min-max scaling
    (many people call this *normalization*) is the simplest: for each attribute, the
    values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging from 0 to 1\. This
    is performed by subtracting the min value from all values, and dividing the results
    by the difference between the min and the max. Scikit-Learn provides a transformer
    called `MinMaxScaler` for this. It has a `feature_range` hyperparameter that lets
    you change the range if, for some reason, you don’t want 0–1 (e.g., neural networks
    work best with zero-mean inputs, so a range of –1 to 1 is preferable). It’s quite
    easy to use:    [PRE103]    Standardization is different: first it subtracts the
    mean value (so standardized values have a zero mean), then it divides the result
    by the standard deviation (so standardized values have a standard deviation equal
    to 1). Unlike min-max scaling, standardization does not restrict values to a specific
    range. However, standardization is much less affected by outliers. For example,
    suppose a district has a median income equal to 100 (by mistake), instead of the
    usual 0–15\. Min-max scaling to the 0–1 range would map this outlier down to 1
    and it would crush all the other values down to 0–0.15, whereas standardization
    would not be much affected. Scikit-Learn provides a transformer called `StandardScaler`
    for standardization:    [PRE104]    ###### Tip    If you want to scale a sparse
    matrix without converting it to a dense matrix first, you can use a `StandardScaler`
    with its `with_mean` hyperparameter set to `False`: it will only divide the data
    by the standard deviation, without subtracting the mean (as this would break sparsity).    When
    a feature’s distribution has a *heavy tail* (i.e., when values far from the mean
    are not exponentially rare), both min-max scaling and standardization will squash
    most values into a small range. Machine learning models generally don’t like this
    at all, as you will see in [Chapter 4](ch04.html#linear_models_chapter). So *before*
    you scale the feature, you should first transform it to shrink the heavy tail,
    and if possible to make the distribution roughly symmetrical. For example, a common
    way to do this for positive features with a heavy tail to the right is to replace
    the feature with its square root (or raise the feature to a power between 0 and
    1). If the feature has a really long and heavy tail, such as a *power law distribution*,
    then replacing the feature with its logarithm may help. For example, the `population`
    feature roughly follows a power law: districts with 10,000 inhabitants are only
    10 times less frequent than districts with 1,000 inhabitants, not exponentially
    less frequent. [Figure 2-17](#long_tail_plot) shows how much better this feature
    looks when you compute its log: it’s very close to a Gaussian distribution (i.e.,
    bell-shaped).  ![Two histograms compare the distribution of a population feature:

    shows a more symmetrical, Gaussian-like distribution after applying a logarithmic
    transformation.](assets/hmls_0217.png)  ###### Figure 2-17\. Transforming a feature
    to make it closer to a Gaussian distribution    Another approach to handle heavy-tailed
    features consists in *bucketizing* the feature. This means chopping its distribution
    into roughly equal-sized buckets, and replacing each feature value with the index
    of the bucket it belongs to, much like we did to create the `income_cat` feature
    (although we only used it for stratified sampling). For example, you could replace
    each value with its percentile. Bucketizing with equal-sized buckets results in
    a feature with an almost uniform distribution, so there’s no need for further
    scaling, or you can just divide by the number of buckets to force the values to
    the 0–1 range.    When a feature has a multimodal distribution (i.e., with two
    or more clear peaks, called *modes*), such as the `housing_median_age` feature,
    it can also be helpful to bucketize it, but this time treating the bucket IDs
    as categories, rather than as numerical values. This means that the bucket indices
    must be encoded, for example using a `OneHotEncoder` (so you usually don’t want
    to use too many buckets). This approach will allow the regression model to more
    easily learn different rules for different ranges of this feature value. For example,
    perhaps houses built around 35 years ago have a peculiar style that fell out of
    fashion, and therefore they’re cheaper than their age alone would suggest.    Another
    approach to transforming multimodal distributions is to add a feature for each
    of the modes (at least the main ones), representing the similarity between the
    housing median age and that particular mode. The similarity measure is typically
    computed using a *radial basis function* (RBF)—any function that depends only
    on the distance between the input value and a fixed point. The most commonly used
    RBF is the Gaussian RBF, whose output value decays exponentially as the input
    value moves away from the fixed point. For example, the Gaussian RBF similarity
    between the housing age *x* and 35 is given by the equation exp(–*γ*(*x* – 35)²).
    The hyperparameter *γ* (gamma) determines how quickly the similarity measure decays
    as *x* moves away from 35\. Using Scikit-Learn’s `rbf_kernel()` function, you
    can create a new Gaussian RBF feature measuring the similarity between the housing
    median age and 35:    [PRE105]    [Figure 2-18](#age_similarity_plot) shows this
    new feature as a function of the housing median age (solid line). It also shows
    what the feature would look like if you used a smaller `gamma` value. As the chart
    shows, the new age similarity feature peaks at 35, right around the spike in the
    housing median age distribution: if this particular age group is well correlated
    with lower prices, there’s a good chance that this new feature will help.  ![Histogram
    and line plot showing the Gaussian RBF feature for age similarity peaking at a
    housing median age of 35, with gamma values of 0.10 and 0.03.](assets/hmls_0218.png)  ######
    Figure 2-18\. Gaussian RBF feature measuring the similarity between the housing
    median age and 35    So far we’ve only looked at the input features, but the target
    values may also need to be transformed. For example, if the target distribution
    has a heavy tail, you may choose to replace the target with its logarithm. But
    if you do, the regression model will now predict the *log* of the median house
    value, not the median house value itself. You will need to compute the exponential
    of the model’s prediction if you want the predicted median house value.    Luckily,
    most of Scikit-Learn’s transformers have an `inverse_transform()` method, making
    it easy to compute the inverse of their transformations. For example, the following
    code example shows how to scale the labels using a `StandardScaler` (just like
    we did for inputs), then train a simple linear regression model on the resulting
    scaled labels and use it to make predictions on some new data, which we transform
    back to the original scale using the trained scaler’s `inverse_transform()` method.
    Note that we convert the labels from a Pandas Series to a DataFrame, since the
    `StandardScaler` expects 2D inputs. Also, in this example we just train the model
    on a single raw input feature (median income), for simplicity:    [PRE106]    This
    works fine, but it’s simpler and less error-prone to use a `TransformedTarget​Regressor`,
    avoiding potential scaling mismatches. We just need to construct it, giving it
    the regression model and the label transformer, then fit it on the training set,
    using the original unscaled labels. It will automatically use the transformer
    to scale the labels and train the regression model on the resulting scaled labels,
    just like we did previously. Then, when we want to make a prediction, it will
    call the regression model’s `predict()` method and use the scaler’s `inverse_transform()`
    method to produce the prediction:    [PRE107]    ## Custom Transformers    Although
    Scikit-Learn provides many useful transformers, you will occasionally need to
    write your own for tasks such as custom transformations, cleanup operations, or
    combining specific attributes.    For transformations that don’t require any training,
    you can just write a function that takes a NumPy array as input and outputs the
    transformed array. For example, as discussed in the previous section, it’s often
    a good idea to transform features with heavy-tailed distributions by replacing
    them with their logarithm (assuming the feature is positive and the tail is on
    the right). Let’s create a log-transformer and apply it to the `population` feature:    [PRE108]    The
    `inverse_func` argument is optional. It lets you specify an inverse transform
    function, e.g., if you plan to use your transformer in a `TransformedTargetRegressor`.    Your
    transformation function can take hyperparameters as additional arguments. For
    example, here’s how to create a transformer that computes the same Gaussian RBF
    similarity measure as earlier:    [PRE109]    Note that there’s no inverse function
    for the RBF kernel, since there are always two values at a given distance from
    a fixed point (except at distance 0). Also note that `rbf_kernel()` does not treat
    the features separately. If you pass it an array with two features, it will measure
    the 2D distance (Euclidean) to measure similarity. For example, here’s how to
    add a feature that will measure the geographic similarity between each district
    and San Francisco:    [PRE110]    Custom transformers are also useful to combine
    features. For example, here’s a `FunctionTransformer` that computes the ratio
    between the input features 0 and 1:    [PRE111]   [PRE112]` `FunctionTransformer`
    is very handy, but what if you would like your transformer to be trainable, learning
    some parameters in the `fit()` method and using them later in the `transform()`
    method? For this, you need to write a custom class.    ###### Note    The rest
    of this section shows how to define custom transformer classes. In particular,
    it defines a custom transformer that groups districts into 10 geographical clusters,
    then measures the distance between each district and the center of each cluster,
    adding 10 corresponding RBF similarity features to the data. Since defining custom
    transformer classes is somewhat advanced, please feel free to skip to the next
    section and come back whenever needed.    Scikit-Learn relies on duck typing,⁠^([13](ch02.html#id1177))
    so custom transformer classes do not have to inherit from any particular base
    class. All they need is three methods: `fit()` (which must return `self`), `transform()`,
    and `fit_transform()`. You can get `fit_transform()` for free by simply adding
    `TransformerMixin` as a base class: the default implementation will just call
    `fit()` and then `transform()`. If you add `BaseEstimator` as a base class (and
    avoid using `*args` and `**kwargs` in your constructor), you will also get two
    extra methods: `get_params()` and `set_params()`. These will be useful for automatic
    hyperparameter tuning.    For example, here’s a custom transformer that acts much
    like the `StandardScaler`:    [PRE113]    Here are a few things to note:    *   The
    `sklearn.utils.validation` package contains several functions we can use to validate
    the inputs. For simplicity, we will skip such tests in the rest of this book,
    but production code should have them.           *   Scikit-Learn pipelines require
    the `fit()` method to have two arguments `X` and `y`, which is why we need the
    `y=None` argument even though we don’t use `y`.           *   All Scikit-Learn
    estimators set `n_features_in_` in the `fit()` method, and they ensure that the
    data passed to `transform()` or `predict()` has this number of features.           *   The
    `fit()` method must return `self`.           *   This implementation is not 100%
    complete: all estimators should set `feature_​names_in_` in the `fit()` method
    when they are passed a DataFrame. Moreover, all transformers should provide a
    `get_feature_names_out()` method, as well as an `inverse_transform()` method when
    their transformation can be reversed. See the last exercise at the end of this
    chapter for more details.              A custom transformer can (and often does)
    use other estimators in its implementation. For example, the following code demonstrates
    a custom transformer that uses a `KMeans` clusterer in the `fit()` method to identify
    the main clusters in the training data, and then uses `rbf_kernel()` in the `transform()`
    method to measure how similar each sample is to each cluster center:    [PRE114]    ######
    Tip    You can check whether your custom estimator respects Scikit-Learn’s API
    by passing an instance to `check_estimator()` from the `sklearn.utils.estimator_checks`
    package. For the full API, check out [*https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers*](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers).    As
    you will see in [Chapter 8](ch08.html#unsupervised_learning_chapter), *k*-means
    is a clustering algorithm that locates clusters in the data. For example, we can
    use it to find the most populated regions in California. How many clusters *k*-means
    searches for is controlled by the `n_clusters` hyperparameter. The `fit()` method
    of `KMeans` supports an optional argument `sample_weight`, which lets the user
    specify the relative weights of the samples. For example, we could pass it the
    median income if we wanted the clusters to be biased toward wealthy districts.
    After training, the cluster centers are available via the `cluster_centers_` attribute.
    *k*-means is a stochastic algorithm, meaning that it relies on randomness to locate
    the clusters, so if you want reproducible results, you must set the `random_state`
    parameter. As you can see, despite the complexity of the task, the code is fairly
    straightforward. Now let’s use this custom transformer:    [PRE115]    This code
    creates a `ClusterSimilarity` transformer, setting the number of clusters to 10\.
    Then it calls `fit_transform()` with the latitude and longitude of every district
    in the training set (you can try weighting each district by its median income
    to see how that affects the clusters). The transformer uses *k*-means to locate
    the clusters, then measures the Gaussian RBF similarity between each district
    and all 10 cluster centers. The result is a matrix with one row per district,
    and one column per cluster. Let’s look at the first three rows, rounding to two
    decimal places:    [PRE116]   `[Figure 2-19](#district_cluster_plot) shows the
    10 cluster centers found by *k*-means. The districts are colored according to
    their geographic similarity to their closest cluster center. Notice that most
    clusters are located in highly populated areas.  ![Scatter plot showing geographic
    clusters based on Gaussian RBF similarity, with highly populated areas highlighted.](assets/hmls_0219.png)  ######

    [PRE119]` [PRE120] ## Transformation Pipelines    As you can see, there are many
    data transformation steps that need to be executed in the right order. Fortunately,
    Scikit-Learn provides the `Pipeline` class to help with such sequences of transformations.
    Here is a small pipeline for numerical attributes, which will first impute then
    scale the input features:    [PRE121]py    The `Pipeline` constructor takes a
    list of name/estimator pairs (2-tuples) defining a sequence of steps. The names
    can be anything you like, as long as they are unique and don’t contain double
    underscores (`__`). They will be useful later, when we discuss hyperparameter
    tuning. The estimators must all be transformers (i.e., they must have a `fit_transform()`
    method), except for the last one, which can be anything: a transformer, a predictor,
    or any other type of estimator.    ###### Tip    In a Jupyter notebook, if you
    `import` `sklearn` and run `sklearn.​set_config(display="diagram")`, all Scikit-Learn
    estimators will be rendered as interactive diagrams. This is particularly useful
    for visualizing pipelines. To visualize `num_pipeline`, run a cell with `num_pipeline`
    as the last line. Clicking an estimator will show more details.    If you don’t
    want to have to name the transformers, you can use the convenient `make_pipeline()`
    function instead; it takes transformers as positional arguments and creates a
    `Pipeline` using the names of the transformers’ classes, in lowercase and without
    underscores (e.g., `"simpleimputer"`):    [PRE122]py    If multiple transformers
    have the same name, an index is appended to their names (e.g., `"foo-1"`, `"foo-2"`,
    etc.).    When you call the pipeline’s `fit()` method, it calls `fit_transform()`
    sequentially on all the transformers, passing the output of each call as the parameter
    to the next call until it reaches the final estimator, for which it just calls
    the `fit()` method.    The pipeline exposes the same methods as the final estimator.
    In this example the last estimator is a `StandardScaler`, which is a transformer,
    so the pipeline also acts like a transformer. If you call the pipeline’s `transform()`
    method, it will sequentially apply all the transformations to the data. If the
    last estimator were a predictor instead of a transformer, then the pipeline would
    have a `predict()` method rather than a `transform()` method. Calling it would
    sequentially apply all the transformations to the data and pass the result to
    the predictor’s `predict()` method.    Let’s call the pipeline’s `fit_transform()`
    method and look at the output’s first two rows, rounded to two decimal places:    [PRE123]py   [PRE124]`py

    # Select and Train a Model    At last! You framed the problem, you got the data
    and explored it, you sampled a training set and a test set, and you wrote a preprocessing
    pipeline to automatically clean up and prepare your data for machine learning
    algorithms. You are now ready to select and train a machine learning model.    ##
    Train and Evaluate on the Training Set    The good news is that thanks to all
    these previous steps, things are now going to be easy! You decide to train a very
    basic linear regression model to get started:    [PRE138]py    Done! You now have
    a working linear regression model. You try it out on the training set, looking
    at the first five predictions and comparing them to the labels:    [PRE139]py

    # Fine-Tune Your Model    Let’s assume that you now have a shortlist of promising
    models. You now need to fine-tune them. Let’s look at a few ways you can do that.    ##
    Grid Search    One option would be to fiddle with the hyperparameters manually,
    until you find a great combination of hyperparameter values. This would be very
    tedious work, and you may not have time to explore many combinations.    Instead,
    you can use Scikit-Learn’s `GridSearchCV` class to search for you. All you need
    to do is tell it which hyperparameters you want it to experiment with and what
    values to try out, and it will use cross-validation to evaluate all the possible
    combinations of hyperparameter values. For example, the following code searches
    for the best combination of hyperparameter values for the `RandomForestRegressor`:    [PRE149]py    Notice
    that you can refer to any hyperparameter of any estimator in a pipeline, even
    if this estimator is nested deep inside several pipelines and column transformers.
    For example, when Scikit-Learn sees `"preprocessing__geo__n_clusters"`, it splits
    this string at the double underscores, then it looks for an estimator named `"preprocessing"`
    in the pipeline and finds the preprocessing `ColumnTransformer`. Next, it looks
    for a transformer named `"geo"` inside this `ColumnTransformer` and finds the
    `ClusterSimilarity` transformer we used on the latitude and longitude attributes.
    Then it finds this transformer’s `n_clusters` hyperparameter. Similarly, `random_forest__max_features`
    refers to the `max_features` hyperparameter of the estimator named `"random_forest"`,
    which is of course the `RandomForestRegressor` model (the `max_features` hyperparameter
    will be explained in [Chapter 6](ch06.html#ensembles_chapter)).    ###### Tip    Wrapping
    preprocessing steps in a Scikit-Learn pipeline allows you to tune the preprocessing
    hyperparameters along with the model hyperparameters. This is a good thing since
    they often interact. For example, perhaps increasing `n_clusters` requires increasing
    `max_features` as well. If fitting the pipeline transformers is computationally
    expensive, you can set the pipeline’s `memory` parameter to the path of a caching
    directory: when you first fit the pipeline, Scikit-Learn will save the fitted
    transformers to this directory. If you then fit the pipeline again with the same
    hyperparameters, Scikit-Learn will just load the cached transformers.    There
    are two dictionaries in this `param_grid`, so `GridSearchCV` will first evaluate
    all 3 × 3 = 9 combinations of `n_clusters` and `max_features` hyperparameter values
    specified in the first `dict`, then it will try all 2 × 3 = 6 combinations of
    hyperparameter values in the second `dict`. So in total the grid search will explore
    9 + 6 = 15 combinations of hyperparameter values, and it will train the pipeline
    3 times per combination, since we are using 3-fold cross validation. This means
    there will be a grand total of 15 × 3 = 45 rounds of training! It may take a while,
    but when it is done you can get the best combination of parameters like this:    [PRE150]py   [PRE151]`py[PRE152]``
    [PRE153]`` ## Randomized Search    The grid search approach is fine when you are
    exploring relatively few combinations, like in the previous example, but `RandomizedSearchCV`
    is often preferable, especially when the hyperparameter search space is large.
    This class can be used in much the same way as the `GridSearchCV` class, but instead
    of trying out all possible combinations it evaluates a fixed number of combinations,
    selecting a random value for each hyperparameter at every iteration. This may
    sound surprising, but this approach has several benefits:    *   If some of your
    hyperparameters are continuous (or discrete but with many possible values), and
    you let randomized search run for, say, 1,000 iterations, then it will explore
    1,000 different values for each of these hyperparameters, whereas grid search
    would only explore the few values you listed for each one.           *   Suppose
    a hyperparameter does not actually make much difference, but you don’t know it
    yet. If it has 10 possible values and you add it to your grid search, then training
    will take 10 times longer. But if you add it to a random search, it will not make
    any difference.           *   If there are 6 hyperparameters to explore, each
    with 10 possible values, then grid search offers no other choice than training
    the model a million times, whereas random search can always run for any number
    of iterations you choose.              For each hyperparameter, you must provide
    either a list of possible values, or a probability distribution:    [PRE154]    Scikit-Learn
    also has `HalvingRandomSearchCV` and `HalvingGridSearchCV` hyperparameter search
    classes. Their goal is to use the computational resources more efficiently, either
    to train faster or to explore a larger hyperparameter space. Here’s how they work:
    in the first round, many hyperparameter combinations (called “candidates”) are
    generated using either the grid approach or the random approach. These candidates
    are then used to train models that are evaluated using cross-validation, as usual.
    However, training uses limited resources, which speeds up this first round considerably.
    By default, “limited resources” means that the models are trained on a small part
    of the training set. However, other limitations are possible, such as reducing
    the number of training iterations if the model has a hyperparameter to set it.
    Once every candidate has been evaluated, only the best ones go on to the second
    round, where they are allowed more resources to compete. After several rounds,
    the final candidates are evaluated using full resources. This may save you some
    time tuning hyperparameters.    ## Ensemble Methods    Another way to fine-tune
    your system is to try to combine the models that perform best. The group (or “ensemble”)
    will often perform better than the best individual model—just like random forests
    perform better than the individual decision trees they rely on—especially if the
    individual models make very different types of errors. For example, you could
    train and fine-tune a *k*-nearest neighbors model, then create an ensemble model
    that just predicts the mean of the random forest prediction and that model’s prediction.
    We will cover this topic in more detail in [Chapter 6](ch06.html#ensembles_chapter).    ##
    Analyzing the Best Models and Their Errors    You will often gain good insights
    on the problem by inspecting the best models. For example, the `RandomForestRegressor`
    can indicate the relative importance of each attribute for making accurate predictions:    [PRE155]
    `>>>` `feature_importances``.``round``(``2``)` `` `array([0.07, 0.05, 0.05, 0.01,
