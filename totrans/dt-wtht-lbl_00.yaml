    be understood only by a select few. At their core, they are simply a way for us
    to help the algorithms assimilate historical datasets and generate insights for
    us. These insights help us to initiate better, faster, and more influential business
    effects We give clear, logical instructions that guide the algorithms to do what
    we want.

    about memorizing Python or R or a programming language syntax or learning some
    commands to run the code or cut-paste the code. It’s about solving pragmatic business
    problems, thinking about the business objectives critically, and breaking down
    those complex tasks meticulously into smaller and manageable steps and hence achieving
    the business objective.

    line of Python code, that’s perfectly fine. It is much easier than you think.
    We start with simple unsupervised learning algorithms.
