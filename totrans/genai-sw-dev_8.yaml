- en: There’s a new kind of coding I call “vibe coding”, where you fully give in to
    the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It’s possible
    because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I
    just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I
    ask for the dumbest things like “decrease the padding on the sidebar by half”
    because I’m too lazy to find it. I “Accept All” always, I don’t read the diffs
    anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment,
    usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I’d have
    to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can’t fix a bug so I
    just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It’s not too
    bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I’m building a project
    or webapp, but it’s not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff,
    and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.

    one with over 8,000 employees around the world and a significant existing codebase
    that supports a solid business. In early 2025, I spoke with Samuel Path, a senior
    software engineer at Shopify, about how he and his team are using AI tools and
    how their software development process has changed in recent years.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Path told me that Shopify is lucky that its CEO, Tobias Lütke, has a technical
    background and saw very early on how these tools could transform the way tech
    products are developed. Lütke created a team dedicated to experimenting with every
    new AI tool and evaluating how well the tools increase productivity and handle
    the sensitive data-protection requirements of such a big company. This team champions
    experimentation and ultimately is responsible for approving tools to be used and
    helping roll them out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Path described how, in 2022 and early 2023, when OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 was the state
    of the art, the models didn’t feel that useful and his team didn’t want to use
    them heavily. It was only in Q2 2023 when OpenAI’s GPT-4 came out, to power both
    GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, that they started using AI tools more for coding.
    However, the workflow was still clunky. Since Copilot’s UI was limited to autocomplete,
    they’d often copy and paste code snippets manually between ChatGPT and their IDEs,
    which meant wrestling with limited context windows. But once Cursor IDE arrived
    on the scene, powered by Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.5, the transformation was
    striking. The new tool cannibalized both of its predecessors, including both autocomplete
    and chat inside the IDE.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This adoption curve had some hiccups. Path recounted a few embarrassing moments
    early on, like shipping some pull requests with subtle bugs that were introduced
    by AI. In fact, some team members were shy about admitting that “it was Claude.”
    His advice? Always review the AI’s work as if it were your own, because when something
    goes wrong, you’re the one responsible for the merge. This lesson, hard-earned
    and often repeated in team meetings, underscores a fundamental truth: while AI
    can supercharge productivity, vigilance is key to keeping code quality high and
    tech debt low.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Path’s team illustrates the current shift in modern software development practices.
    Initially, they used tools like Copilot mainly for trivial autocompletion tasks.
    But as AI models improved, the team began to rely on tools that could digest larger
    chunks of context. They started by pasting entire modules of failing code into
    an AI chat interface and receiving detailed troubleshooting steps. This not only
    reduced downtime, it also accelerated the learning process for everyone on the
    team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'With Cursor, code generation became less about autocompletion and more about
    crafting entire workflows: running tests, fixing linter errors, and suggesting
    architectural tweaks. Yet the team never lost sight of one important principle:
    always maintain a critical eye. AI-generated code can, and often does, contain
    hallucinations, including bugs, performance issues, logic flaws, or code that
    degrades existing functionality.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    After those initial hiccups, they iterated a robust process that’s implemented
    both upstream and downstream of the actual coding of a feature. That means they
    do two things consistently:'

    are included in all prompts made to Cursor. Path’s prompting process includes
    all functional context for a given task (often as written in the ticketing system)
    as well as clear implementation guidelines, as if he’s instructing a colleague.
    This reduces Cursor’s margin of error, since it will follow those implementation
    instructions. This process often includes some back-and-forth discussion with
    Cursor about implementation options and trade-offs. While this does add some overhead
    to any development task, the actual coding becomes effortless, with Cursor generating
    most of the code.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Shopify’s robust engineering processes have long included code reviews before
    any pull requests get merged. However, the team recognizes that AI tools now generate
    a significant part of any PR, so after those initial hiccups they doubled down
    on code reviews. First, the actual developer reviews the code generated by Cursor,
    often using a mix of another AI tool and a manual review. Then, once they open
    the PR for their changes, at least one other team member must review the changes,
    often applying the same approach of combining an AI tool with manual revision.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For me, the biggest highlight of my chat with Path was learning how these tools
    allow the Shopify team to move from a fluid process of writing code to a process
    with clear separation between planning the implementation (which goes into the
    prompt) and actually implementing it (most of which the tool does). I think Shopify,
    or at least this team, exemplifies the changes I’m seeing in my own work as a
    CTO and in the descriptions I read from high-performing engineering teams.

    they’ve been as a company, from the top down, about filtering through the noise

    opened as a result of those lower operating costs. There were fewer human employees
    per bank branch, on average, but once it was cheaper to open new bank branches,
    the resulting industry-wide market growth ultimately *produced more bank-teller
    jobs than it eliminated*.

    part of the actual process of writing code, but those implementation-planning
    and code-review phases will still require human software engineers. There are
    similarities between the ATMs of 50 years ago and AI coding tools today, and their
    impact on the job market could also follow a similar pattern.

    kill an entire job category. Before the early 20th century, elevators had operators,
    who used large levers to regulate the elevator car’s speed, stop it level with
    floors, and open and close the doors. However, once push buttons were introduced,
    the elevator operator job diminished until it went fully extinct in the mid-20th
    century.

    the elevator from one floor to another. Certainly they did other things, like
    greeting passengers, announcing floors, and even acting as informal guides, especially
    in hotels and stores. But their core job was indeed to move people between floors,
    and the buttons did replace 100% of that function. Thus, the elevator operator
    job disappeared.'

    some jobs to shrink and others to grow, and brought whole new job titles into
    existence. It’s a more recent and probably more nuanced historical example that
    we can use to forecast the impact of AI tools on the software engineering profession.

- en: Before spreadsheets, tracking and reconciling numbers required intense work
    from bookkeepers and accounting clerks. As software automated many of those time-intensive
    tasks, such as data entry, tabulation, and basic calculations, the need for these
    positions declined, as shown in [Figure 8-2](#ch08_figure_2_1749441077420402).
    This allowed businesses to allocate resources elsewhere. Accountant and auditor
    roles required deeper financial insight, and now that more companies had their
    numbers in order, demand for these roles increased. At the same time, spreadsheet
    tools enabled more advanced financial modeling and analysis, which fueled the
    growth of new roles like management analysts and financial managers that focused
    on interpreting data, strategic decision-making, and forward-looking financial
    planning. Excel thus marked a shift away from manual bookkeeping and toward higher-level
    analytical and advisory functions.

    while simultaneously expanding or creating others. Jobs focusing on repetitive,
    mechanical tasks often shrink, while jobs requiring judgment, domain expertise,

    titles to emerge from AI-based software development, too. Titles like prompt engineer,
    AI integration specialist, data curator, and AI trainer might sound weird today,
    but they capture a real shift in the daily tasks of modern software developers.
    There will likely be entire teams dedicated to evaluating new AI tools, customizing
    them for specific codebases, and ensuring data privacy and compliance across AI-driven
    pipelines.

    whole chapters of this book as new tools were invented and improvements to the

    says a lot about how quickly companies and individuals need to move to adopt and
    integrate the latest tools. I’m lucky that this is part of my scope of work as
    a fractional CTO. I’m accountable for making my clients’ software development
    teams fast and efficient, and that includes being on top of these new tools.
