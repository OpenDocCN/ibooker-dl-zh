- en: In part 3, we highlight the critical role of testing, quality assessment, and
    explanation in AI-augmented software development. This section focuses on ensuring
    the reliability and robustness of software built with LLMs. It covers the processes
    involved in bug hunting and code translation, emphasizing the importance of thorough
    testing and quality control. Using AI, developers can generate clear explanations
    of AI-generated code, facilitating better understanding and collaboration within
    development teams. This part underscores the necessity of maintaining high standards
    in software quality and provides strategies for achieving this in an AI-driven
    environment.
