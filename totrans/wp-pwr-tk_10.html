<p class="body">Search engine optimization (SEO) used to matter. It meant modifying your website so that search engines such as Google or Bing would list your site up high in the results when people search for your site’s topic. This no longer works.</p>
<p class="body">The goal was to get a link to your site listed at least on the first page of the list of links Google displayed. Few people looked at the links on the second page. This <i class="fm-italics">was</i> what SEO meant in the past. AI is seriously disrupting SEO. Things are very different now. SEO is being replaced with AI optimization (AIO).</p>
<p class="body">Google just displayed a list of links that you could visit to get the information you were after. Now, AI skips the links and just gives you the info. Some AIs, such as Gemini and Perplexity, include a list of links as citations. And you can request citations from any of the AI systems. But links are optional.</p>
<p class="body">AI scans sites and reads their contents. Then, like a research assistant, AI provides you with the answer to your query. And if needed, you can chat with AI, asking for a different or more precise response.</p>
<p class="body">Put simply, AI gives you answers; Google just gave you a list of places to look for answers yourself. Now it’s as if you had a researcher at your disposal and asked them to look around the internet, solve a problem, and then bring you the results.</p>
<p class="body">Because AI is changing internet searching, you as a site designer must switch your efforts from SEO to AIO. In this chapter, you’ll see how to do just that.</p>
<p class="body">We’ll also look at Google Search Console, an important resource to help you increase your audience. It can measure traffic and performance for your keywords, which are vital for content optimization. And, we’ll also explore the popular SEO plugin All In One SEO (AIOSEO), which includes a sitemap builder to make it easy for AI to quickly understand your site’s organization.<a id="idIndexMarker001"/></p>
<p class="body">AI assesses the quality of your site somewhat differently from the algorithms Google and other earlier search systems used. AI critiques are more sophisticated and include larger data searches and more intelligent assessments. Soon AI will judge sites as well as an experienced human website critic.</p>
<p class="body">That said, some previous SEO tactics (having good backlinks, especially from highly-ranked sites, for example) still work. Let’s take a look at how best to please AI.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_3">11.1 Learning new optimization tactics</h2>
<p class="body">Google and Bing are rapidly incorporating AI into their search engines. Google is adding its AI alternative—Gemini—to its search page (a bit unsuccessfully so far). And it displays an AI Answer button you can click. Bing prominently displays its AI Copilot icon. And now, both search engines just answer questions when you search rather than displaying a list of links to make you look for the answer.<a id="marker-269"/><a id="idIndexMarker002"/></p>
<p class="body">One thing, however, remains the same: your site will do best if you focus on providing the very finest content you’re capable of. That requirement will never change no matter how sophisticated AI becomes. Ultimately, quality should be your primary goal.</p>
<p class="body">Decades of reverse engineering, hundreds of SEO experts’ tips, and instructions from Google itself have produced a huge store of advice about SEO. But what about AIO? What criteria does AI use when deciding which websites to visit and cite?</p>
<p class="body">AI training involves, among other things, massive data scraping—roaming the internet and storing information. So, you provide a prompt, and it searches its huge existing data store. But AI is also increasingly gathering other data from YouTube videos and other multimodal sources. Most AI systems are now (or soon will be) capable of providing answers on current queries in real time. Do <i class="fm-italics">they</i> use Google when searching?</p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">

<p class="fm-sidebar-text">The key takeaway is that the various AI systems use different methods to access and process information. GPT and Gemini seem to perhaps have “indirect” access to Google, and Claude says it doesn’t have access to current data. Perplexity is considered by many to be the best at most kinds of research, including current topics. It’s answer “reputable sources” doesn’t really tell us <i class="fm-italics">how</i> it searches these sources. GPT added real-time searching in November, 2024. Its power and rank as a search system is yet to be decided.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">Even though traditional SEO is being disrupted by AI, some tactics remain important for impressing AI systems. One such tactic is learning to include the best <i class="fm-italics">keywords. <a id="idIndexMarker003"/></i></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_4">11.2 Using good keywords</h2>
<p class="body">Keywords are the words people used to type into a search engine when starting a search. If, for example, they wanted to know the best place in <i class="fm-italics">Dallas</i> to <i class="fm-italics">sell</i> their <i class="fm-italics">coin collection</i>, the keywords would be those in italics.<a id="idIndexMarker004"/><a id="marker-272"/><a id="idIndexMarker005"/></p>
<p class="body">This keyword list could also include synonyms, such as <i class="fm-italics">shop</i>, <i class="fm-italics">coins</i>, <i class="fm-italics">buyer</i>, and <i class="fm-italics">dealer</i>. I wouldn’t include <i class="fm-italics">numismatic.</i> Few people are likely to use that word, much less know how it’s spelled.</p>
<p class="body">So, your first AIO task is to figure out what are the keywords for your site’s topic. Normally, your site’s title and tagline contain keywords. And you can prompt GPT:</p>

<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> In the early days of search engines, their analyses were largely quantitative. So, you could succeed simply by keyword stuffing—that is, use keywords as many times as possible. These days, keywords must be used naturally; they must belong in the content where appropriate. AIs are sophisticated, and their judgments are increasingly qualitative—much more like the way a human website expert would judge sites.</p>
<p class="body">It’s crucial to carry out in-depth keyword research to find the most pertinent and important terms that accurately describe your content. Think about your target audience’s <i class="fm-italics">search intent</i> before anything else. What topics are your likely visitors looking for? Then, what terminology would they use to find sites that would be useful to them? <a id="idIndexMarker006"/></p>
<p class="body">Who are your visitors? What words would they use when searching? You should aim for a total of about five keywords—too many, and they become less effective.</p>
<p class="body">Spend some time thinking about who your potential visitors are. What might they ask AI that would cause AI to cite your website? Jot down those keywords. Finally, go to an AI, and, using those keywords, see what sites are cited. Visit these sites. Are they similar to your site? If not, rethink your keywords.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> A free keyword tool from WordStream (<a class="url" href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords">www.wordstream.com/keywords</a>) can give you some good ideas.</p>
<p class="body">After determining which keywords are best, ensure you include them <i class="fm-italics">organically</i> in your body text, headers, and other areas such as captions. Don’t force them into content where they don’t naturally fit. AIs can tell. Cramming your content with keywords will damage your AIO.</p>
<p class="body">Instead, concentrate on producing excellent, worthwhile content that truly satisfies the search intent associated with the keywords you’ve selected. Think keywords that represent the topic and focus of your site. Use tools such as Google Analytics (see chapter 12) to track the effectiveness of your chosen keywords on a regular basis and make any necessary revisions.</p>
<p class="body">We’ve covered some general tips on finding effective keywords for your site. Now let’s look at some more specific pointers about how to use keywords effectively.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_5">11.2.1 Ask AI for good keywords</h3>
<p class="body">AI can examine your entire site (or just parts of it like the blog page or the home page). However, at the time of this writing, only GPT will actually visit, scan, and analyze a site. <a id="idIndexMarker007"/><a id="idIndexMarker008"/><a id="marker-273"/></p>
<p class="body">As you’ve seen in previous chapters, most AI systems still require that you upload the text or media content that you want them to look at. If you ask them to read through your website, they will reply that they don’t have the ability to do that. Copilot will reply “I’m sorry for any misunderstanding, but as an AI, I don’t have the ability to directly analyze websites or access specific competitor data.”</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_6">11.2.2 Asking AI to scan sites</h3>
<p class="body">GPT-4o however, does an excellent job of analyzing a site directly. This has a clear advantage over uploading content.

<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> Visit the agent.ai site (<a class="url" href="https://agent.ai/">https://agent.ai/</a>) and you’ll find several effective specialized AIs, including one that helps you improve your site. It’s called Website Conversion Optimizer.</p>
<p class="body">Now let’s return to the subject of keywords, by asking this question: Should you be using keyphrases?<a id="idIndexMarker011"/><a id="idIndexMarker012"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_7">11.2.3 Using long-tail keywords</h3>
<p class="body">Some say you should think about making keywords more specific by adding modifiers. Instead of just <i class="fm-italics">Instant Pot Recipes</i>, you would add adjectives like this: <i class="fm-italics">Instant Pot chicken breast recipe.<a id="idIndexMarker013"/><a id="idIndexMarker014"/></i></p>
<p class="body">Recall from chapter 1 that you were urged to focus your site’s topic. Instead of <i class="fm-italics">Fishing</i>, you would attract many more visitors, and ultimately more conversions (repeat visitors), if your site’s topic is <i class="fm-italics">Bass Fishing in North Carolina’s Randleman Lake.</i></p>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-277"/>The same concept applies to long-tail keywords. These are longer, more specific keyword <i class="fm-italics">phrases</i>. For example <i class="fm-italics">bass bait</i> is a regular keyword, but <i class="fm-italics">bass lures for winter fishing</i> is a long-tail version. This is one way to reduce your site’s competition.</p>
<p class="body">If people intend to find what you’re specifically offering, then they might well type in some adjectives. Most search queries include adjectives, so long-tail prompts are likely to match your long-tail keywords. But do use your head. Keep in mind what you would look for. You wouldn’t type <i class="fm-italics">flavorful IP chicken breast recipes,</i> would you? How many people would use <i class="fm-italics">flavorful</i> in that query? They might, however, use <i class="fm-italics">best</i>, <i class="fm-italics">popular</i>, <i class="fm-italics">easy</i>, or <i class="fm-italics">healthy.</i></p>
<p class="body">You might be thinking: well, I’m writing sentences, so I just naturally use long-tail keywords in my site’s text content. True enough. But here are some ways to improve your long-tail efforts by bending your syntax a bit, or adding a modifier:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Go to Google, and type in your site’s topic. As you type, see what Google provides as suggested auto-completion. For example, if I type <i class="fm-italics">instant pot,</i> I get this list of auto-completion terms: <i class="fm-italics">recipes</i>, <i class="fm-italics">rice</i>, <i class="fm-italics">chicken recipes</i>, <i class="fm-italics">beef stew</i>, <i class="fm-italics">pinto beans</i>, and <i class="fm-italics">pot roast</i>. Doing this might also give you some ideas about subjects you should consider including in your site.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="fm-calloute"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> You can also always count on AI to let you know if you’ve left out any important topics. Here’s my prompt to GPT: “Scan all the pages in my website at <a class="url" href="https://watergarden.signalstreaming.com">https://watergarden.signalstreaming.com</a>. Please look at this and respond by listing any topics I have not included that should perhaps be added to my site.”</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Pay attention to how you word your links. While the site’s main menu item links should be quite short, other kinds of links can be more descriptive and thus include long-tail keywords. Again, moderation is key though. Don’t make them too long, or let them sound forced.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">If you know any lingo or special terms used by your target audience, consider incorporating them into your keyword phrases when appropriate. Or ask AI what special terms or jargon are used by people cooking with the instant pot.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Check out this Moz keyword tool (<a class="url" href="https://moz.com/explorer">https://moz.com/explorer</a>). The site claims Keyword Explorer can provide more than a million keyword suggestions.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">See what phrases your competition is using in their sites.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Many prompts and searches include a question. So, consider using some questions in your text. “What is the best IP recipe for pinto beans?” (Then, provide the recipe.) Q&amp;A is said to be a good way to improve AIO. Also, use the AnswerThePublic tool (<a class="url" href="https://answerthepublic.com/">https://answerthepublic.com/</a>) to see what questions are typically used related to your keywords.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Ensure that you provide thorough answers to any questions you raise. Depth and comprehensive content are appreciated by AI, search engines, and your audience. But also include brevity. Variety—some long answers, some short—is best. The length of your answers should be just enough to satisfactorily answer the question. <i class="fm-italics">Comprehensive</i> and <i class="fm-italics">thorough</i> don’t necessarily mean lengthy. Short can suffice: Is salt always used in savory dishes? Yes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_8">11.2.4 Improvements in ranking</h3>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-278"/>For years, Google has continually modified and improved its site assessment algorithms. In fact, it’s estimated that Google makes <i class="fm-italics">hundreds</i> of minor adjustments every year and major modifications about once a month. <i class="fm-italics">Major</i> here means that there’s a noticeable effect on ranking.<a id="idIndexMarker015"/><a id="idIndexMarker016"/></p>
<p class="body">Google has been using AI tools also. Google was using some of these methods even before AI arrived: deep data mining, <i class="fm-italics">contextualization</i> (context sen<a id="idTextAnchor004"/>sitivity), and <i class="fm-italics">latent semantic indexing</i> (LSI). <a id="idIndexMarker017"/></p>
<p class="body">Understanding Google’s evolving algorithms and AI techniques is important for improving a website’s visibility and, for many sites, ultimately its popularity. If they don’t visit you, your site won’t grow. Website owners should stay as informed as possible about algorithm changes in AI systems. The following subsections describe the main AI procedures that Google developed on the road to full AI.</p>
<p class="fm-head2">Deep data mining</p>
<p class="body">AI systems specialize in being able to study large collections of data—far too large for a human to analyze and find hidden patterns. AI can hold massive data collections in its mind all at once. It sees hidden patterns, relationships, processes, and trends. They’re hidden from us humans, anyway. For example, by looking at <i class="fm-italics">all</i> social media messages, AI could identify trends in food preferences long before they became widely known. What’s more, AI learns and improves itself over time. <a id="idIndexMarker018"/><a id="marker-279"/><a id="idIndexMarker019"/></p>
<p class="fm-head2">Contextualization</p>
<p class="body">Before exploring the specific terms that shape how search engines function, it’s important to grasp the fundamental concepts that drive their ability to understand and deliver relevant information. By understanding these foundational ideas, we can better appreciate how search technologies interpret user queries and prioritize meaningful results:<a id="idIndexMarker020"/><a id="idIndexMarker021"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">A study of meanin</i><i class="fm-italics">g</i>—Semantics, as it relates to search engines, is the study of how computers interpret words and their semantic connections. When a user types a query, search engines attempt to determine what they are actually looking for. Each letter typed in sends the search down a more specific pathway through the data.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Relevanc</i><i class="fm-italics">e</i>—Worthwhile search results should make sense in relation to the user’s search keywords. Content that offers precise, in-depth responses or details on the actual subject matter of the search phrases will appear higher in the results.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Exclusive term</i><i class="fm-italics">s</i>—AI is now quite good at deciphering the purpose of a query and the relationships between ideas. These days, AI goes well beyond simple methods such as keyword matching. AI looks for meaningful information as effectively as a human searching a big database, if a human could actually do that in a lifetime.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="fm-head2">Latent semantic indexing</p>
<p class="body">Latent semantic indexing (LSI) is a technique used by AI to understand the relationships between words and concepts, helping to provide context beyond mere keywords and improve the relevance and quality of search results:<a id="idIndexMarker022"/><a id="idIndexMarker023"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Close content examination</i>—AIs use the LSI mathematical technique to identify connections between words and concepts in a website. AI provides context and goes beyond just working with keywords.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Associated words</i>—LSI determines words, phrases, and their relationships, that is, what terms are commonly used together. When a user searches for “right,” for instance, LSI can assist AI in determining if the user is referring to the opposite of left or correct.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Topical depth</i>—AIs give preference to websites that offer a thorough grasp of a subject by mentioning a range of relevant terms. If you use synonyms and semantically related terms, AI will boost your score because it assumes you’re fully addressing the topic. And vice versa: if your site doesn’t cover an element important to the site’s topic, you’ll be downgraded.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Detecting keyword stuffing</i>—Semantics and LSI-related strategies also help AI decide if you’re just repeating keywords for no purpose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="fm-calloute"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> Always aim to satisfy your visitors’ needs and expectations with the finest, most helpful content you can provide. AIs are now perfectly capable of noticing if you try any kind of trickery. So don’t be tempted to even try any LSI stuffing either. Offer clean, clear, useful info.</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Advanced techniques</i>—Complex neural networks, large language models (LLMs), and huge data sets now let AI systems understand both the intent of a prompt as well as the actual quality, appropriateness, and depth of a site’s content in satisfying that intent. So, you must present your audience with valuable content if you want to be approved. <a id="idIndexMarker024"/><a id="idIndexMarker025"/><a id="idIndexMarker026"/><a id="idIndexMarker027"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_9">11.2.5 Understanding Intentions</h3>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-280"/>Experts describe several different intentions that you should consider when imagining the thought process of your prospective audience. <i class="fm-italics">User intent</i> refers to the basic motive or objective of a user’s query. It’s important that you understand user intent specific to your site’s topic if you expect to come up with the right keywords. Satisfying user intent also helps AIO. User intent typically comes in four flavors:<a id="idIndexMarker028"/><a id="idIndexMarker029"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Navigational intent</i>—The user knows what they need. They want to go to a particular narrowly defined page or website. For instance, looking up “IP recipes” or “Randleman Lake fishing” demonstrates that the user is aware of their destination. Or they want to buy a particular kind of fishing lure or see a specific recipe.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Informational intent</i>—The user wants information. For instance, a search for “how to tie a fishing knot” suggests the user is looking for guidance or knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Investigation</i>—Before deciding on a purchase or course of action, the user is weighing their options and seeking additional information. For example, searching for the “best bass fishing lures” means they want to weigh their options before buying.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Transactional intent</i>—The user plans to make a transaction, such as a purchase. For instance, they’re ready to buy a product or service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">When you match your content to the intent of your users, you increase the likelihood that your website will satisfy your audience—and AI and search engines love that. For example, a thorough, accurate, educational article that does a great job of addressing the queries of the majority of users searching for a particular term is probably going to rank higher than a product page.</p>
<p class="body">Your content should be polished and fulfill the informational needs of your audience. For instance, if they are primarily looking for information about fishing methods, equipment, or nearby fishing locations, this strategy improves user experience and boosts AIO simultaneously, which results in more repeat business as well. Next, let’s look at an important set of tools that you should employ to increase traffic to your site.<a id="idIndexMarker030"/><a id="idIndexMarker031"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_10">11.3 Employing Google Search Console</h2>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-281"/>Google offers Search Console, a valuable collection of useful ways to—if not game their and AI’s evolving ranking systems—at least keep up with your competition. Google describes this set of tools like this: “Search Console tools and reports help you measure your site’s Search traffic and performance, fix problems, and make your site shine in Google Search results.” Be sure to visit the Google Search Console site (<a class="url" href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">https://search.google.com/search-console/about</a>) to learn more.<a id="idIndexMarker032"/><a id="idIndexMarker033"/></p>
<p class="body">Sites are always in competition with other sites to some extent, and your search engine rank is one gauge of how well you’re competing. You can be sure other site designers are taking advantage of Google’s dedicated SEO and AIO tools.</p>
<p class="body">With Search Console, you can improve and troubleshoot your website’s visibility in search results. The Console offers instruments and data to assess the performance and volume of a website’s search engine traffic, address problems, and maximize your visibility. You’ll find a number of utilities and reports, including crawling error notifications, search query analysis, and indexing status checks:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Crawling error notifications</i>—These come to you by email when Google finds problems with your website. You’ll be told which URLs (both home pages and interior pages, each of your pages has its own unique URL) are affected by these problems, and then you can notify Google once you’ve resolved them. This kind of error includes server errors, redirect errors, and pages not found (404 errors). Put more simply, Google’s crawler bot was unable to read content in these pages because it couldn’t find them.<a id="idIndexMarker034"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Search query analysis</i>—Find out which queries (and therefore which keywords or keyphrases) are actually sending visitors to your site. You’ll be able to see your site’s position in Google’s search results.<a id="idIndexMarker035"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Indexing status checks</i>—These are similar to crawling errors, but these errors mostly happened <i class="fm-italics">after</i> a page was successfully read by the crawler bot. Google crawled the page, but for a variety of reasons didn’t index (rank) it. An unindexed page’s content hasn’t been analyzed by Google, nor stored in its database, and thus becomes ineligible for display in the search results.<a id="idIndexMarker036"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">You obviously need to check periodically to ensure that your site’s published pages are being successfully indexed. Your site might not appear at all in the search results, or at least the content of that page won’t. True, a single 404 (missing page) error won’t necessarily exclude your entire site from being considered for listing in the results, but it certainly won’t help your rank. Fix broken links to nonexistent pages as soon as possible. You want to ensure that all your content is being indexed.</p>
<p class="body">Frequent updating is also said to improve AIO. And if you do add or polish content, you can let Google know by submitting individual page URLs or sitemaps to the Console.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Definition</span> A <i class="fm-italics">sitemap</i> makes it easier for AI or Google bots to understand the types of content, their interrelationships, and their relative importance. This is particularly useful for large sites, or sites with lots of varying content. But every site should offer a map. This next section describes an SEO plugin which, among many other things, generates your sitemap for you, allows you to edit it, and then helps you submit it to Google and AI. <a id="idIndexMarker037"/></p>

<p class="body">We’ve looked at several things you can do to help your site, now let’s explore one of the best plugins that can give you further assistance in making a good impression on computerized web critics.<a id="idIndexMarker044"/><a id="idIndexMarker045"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_11">11.4 Using the AIOSEO plugin</h2>
<p class="body">Of the dozens of plugins for improving WordPress sites, only two are dominant: Yoast SEO and All in One SEO (AIOSEO). Both are solid, but here we’ll look at AIOSEO because it’s a bit easier to set up and a little less aggressive.<a id="marker-283"/><a id="idIndexMarker046"/><a id="idIndexMarker047"/></p>
<p class="body">AIOSEO is a good and popular choice. It’s a freemium plugin, and you might well find that the free version is sufficient for your needs. To learn more about their unlimited free trial, go here: <a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/lYoz">https://mng.bz/lYoz</a>.</p>
<p class="body">The plugin is relatively easy to set up because its default settings are good for many kinds of sites. However, you do want to review them to see if you need to fine-tune the settings.</p>
<p class="body">After you’ve installed and activated it, go to the All In One SEO &gt; Dashboard screen, and click Launch the Setup Wizard. Or, if you prefer, read their Setup Guide or watch a video on YouTube that describes the setup process.</p>
<p class="body">The wizard asks you what category your site falls into—corporate, store, portfolio, and so on. Then, you provide other details as the wizard steps you through the setup process. In some pages of the wizard, you’re offered options that can only be selected if you have one of AIOSEO’s paid tiers.</p>
<p class="body">The plugin will email you its suggestions on ways to improve your particular site’s search engine rankings. And if asked to provide a license key, you can just skip that step unless you’re using one of the paid plans.</p>
<p class="body">Now, go to the main WordPress Dashboard, and navigate to the All In One SEO &gt; Sitemaps screen. There are quite a few configurations for the maps, so you might want to review this documentation on the AIOSEO blog (<a class="url" href="https://AIOSEO.com/docs/how-to-create-an-xml-sitemap/">https://AIOSEO.com/docs/how-to-create-an-xml-sitemap/</a>). And if you need documentation for other elements within AIOSEO, you can click the ? icon in the upper-right corner.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_12">11.4.1 Managing the sitemap</h3>
<p class="body">You can make changes to the All in One SEO sitemap using WordPress. In addition to creating a sitemap for you automatically, AIOSEO gives you the ability to edit specific items from your sitemap. To see how to manage your sitemap, the documentation is available at <a class="url" href="https://AIOSEO.com/features/smart-xml-sitemaps/">https://AIOSEO.com/features/smart-xml-sitemaps/</a>.<a id="idIndexMarker048"/><a id="idIndexMarker049"/><a id="idIndexMarker050"/><a id="marker-284"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> If you want to go deeply into sitemap management with AIOSEO, look here: <a class="url" href="https://AIOSEO.com/doc-categories/xml-sitemap/">https://AIOSEO.com/doc-categories/xml-sitemap/</a>.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> AIOSEO includes tools to assist you with <i class="fm-italics">schema markup</i>. This means labeling the various elements in your site content (for example, here is a video, a description of it, its duration, or this is a recipe, its nutritional info, its cooking time, its ingredients and instructions). A site marked up with these labels makes it easier for bots to understand your site. And it’s thought that schema markup is poised to become even more essential now that AI bots replace traditional search engine methods. AIOSEO includes both automated and hand-edited markup tools. More<a id="idTextAnchor005"/> details are available from the WordStr<a id="idTextAnchor006"/>eam blog (<a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/8Ozg">https://mng.bz/8Ozg</a>) and from AIOSEO (<a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/Ea1r">https://mng.bz/Ea1r</a>).<a id="idIndexMarker051"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_13">11.5 Employing backlinks</h2>
<p class="body">The early search engines made simple, primitive judgements about site quality. For example, they would just count how many times the word <i class="fm-italics">recipe</i> appeared in a site. And the site with the greatest number ranked highest. <a id="idIndexMarker052"/><a id="idIndexMarker053"/></p>
<p class="body">We’ve come a long way since then. All kinds of deep data searches, AI judgements, and subtle analyses are currently employed when assessing the quality of a site. Backlinks—links to your site from another site—are still considered an important factor. Backlinks are particularly valuable if the other site linking to your site is itself highly ranked. In effect, this means that the content of your site is respected by reputable site managers. They linked to your site. So, it’s likely that you’re doing a good job and offering easily accessed content of real value.</p>
<p class="body">Of course, once Google introduced backlink ranking, various dishonest schemers popped up offering to sell you tons of fake backlinks—you pay them and they backlink to you multiple times from their array of automated link generators in zombie sites. It didn’t take Google long to figure out what was going on and to penalize the parties involved.</p>
<p class="body">How can you get more true backlinks? It’s legit (well, maybe <i class="fm-italics">semi-legit</i>) for you to reach out to a quality site with a topic related to yours. Then, offer to exchange links. You can also offer to provide guest posts on reputable blogs and include For Further Information backlinks in your post. Finally use a <i class="fm-italics">link gap analysis</i> to look at the backlinks in sites that compete with yours. This gives you a list of sites that you might want to invite to link to yours.<a id="idIndexMarker054"/></p>
<p class="body">Here’s a tutorial from Semrush that will assist you with gap analysis and additional ideas about how to obtain quality backlinks: <a class="url" href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/how-to-get-backlinks/">www.semrush.com/blog/how-to-get-backlinks/</a>. And here’s more assistance with this topic from Backlinko: <a class="url" href="https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors">https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors</a>.</p>
<p class="body">This is a brief checklist of effective ways to generate backlinks:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">As always, make sure you have valuable content, unique if possible. This way, your site will naturally attract backlinks.</p>
</li>

<p class="list">Join and participate in forums and other sites.</p>

</ul>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_14">11.6 A checklist of blunders</h2>
<p class="body">As you’ve seen, search engines are quite sophisticated by now—and AI is pushing the analyses further toward (and eventually <i class="fm-italics">beyond</i>) human-level critical judgments of site value. By now, it’s probably become impossible to game AI site judgments. Don’t even try.<a id="idIndexMarker055"/><a id="marker-285"/></p>
<p class="body">That said, let’s look at a list of obvious bungles you’ll do well to avoid if you want to impress AI. Some of these suggestions appeared in different chapters, but it could be useful to have them gathered together here in this single checklist:</p>

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_15">11.7 How AI affects SEO</h2>
<p class="body">What effect will AI have on optimizing a site? What new tactics should a website developer use to make your site impressive to GPT and the others? Let’s pause for a minute and consider the effect AI will have on many creative activities, including optimizing websites. AI didn’t write this book. I did. But I believe this will be my last book. Artists, photographers, and illustrators face powerful, actually unbeatable, competition from Midjourney and other text-to-image generators. So, too, do we writers face obsolescence now that AI is capable of generating brilliant articles in seconds and even entire books in minutes.<a id="idIndexMarker057"/><a id="marker-287"/><a id="idIndexMarker058"/></p>
<p class="body">Some people do say, “Oh, AI makes errors.” I always find this comment puzzling. I think to myself: “Humans don’t?”</p>
<p class="body">But before looking at more ways to get your site well-liked by AI, permit me one more demonstration of the clear superiority of AI’s creative works over the majority of human efforts. This next “photo” might help convince doubters that AI is, in fact, coming for our jobs—and coming fast.</p>
<p class="body">Critics have said that beauty without flaw is less beautiful. Francis Bacon said, “There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion.” I asked Midjourney, arguably today’s most impressive text-to-art generator, to illustrate this principle. It managed to do the job splendidly, as you can see in figure 11.3.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="824" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH11_F03_Mansfield.png" width="900"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 11.3 Were I an artist, photographer, or illustrator, I’d be looking for a second, backup job. We just can’t compete with AI.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">Some will say, “So this is just something that AI found in its vast store of images, and pretended it invented. It’s just a derivative image.” Nope. Do a Google reverse image search for this stunning photo. You won’t find it anywhere in history. It’s a totally original and exquisite photograph . . . a photograph that didn’t involve a photographer or camera.</p>
<p class="body">That “photo” could go right smack into <i class="fm-italics">Vogue</i> unaltered. Richard Avedon would be proud to call it his own. Yet the image was invented by an AI system based on the following request I gave Midjourney:</p>
<table border="0" class="contenttable-c-table" width="100%">
<colgroup class="contenttable-0-colgroup">
<col class="contenttable-0-col" span="1" width="7%"/>

<p class="fm-exercise">Display a photo illustrating the concept that beauty without flaws is less beautiful. That’s the reason for the fake black mole great beauties sometimes stick on their face. Or dotted veils.</p>
</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p class="body">AI understood my request and produced this unique, new to the world, demonstration of that concept. Midjourney produced a very beautiful result, you must agree.</p>
<p class="body">To finish up this chapter I wanted to explore what will probably be changing as we make the transition from SEO to AIO. AI systems will replace traditional search-engine site ranking. What new algorithms will be employed? What kinds of structure, formatting, designs, text content, and varieties of presentation will appeal to AI?<a id="marker-288"/></p>

<p class="fm-exercise">Here are some tips that are specific to optimizing for AI systems beyond traditional SEO. The key focus areas that are more AI-specific relate to optimizing knowledge structure and using emerging standards to provide descriptive, machine-readable signals throughout content:<a class="calibre" id="marker-289"/></p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Use descriptive headers and subheaders. AI systems scan content to understand structure, and clear headings help inform that process.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Summarize key points at the start and end of articles. Chatbots often provide summaries to users, so ensuring critical info is in introductions and conclusions is important.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Employ knowledge graphs where applicable. Marking up relationships between entities, topics, events etc. in a structured way facilitates AI analysis.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Enable rich results across platforms. Optimize content so chat platforms can display expanded previews with images, descriptions etc. rather than just generic links.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Curate authoritative external links. Links to credible external sources demonstrate you understand a topic area well and are integrating broader knowledge.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Publish FAQs and Q&amp;As. Training AI systems may leverage question-based datasets, so providing lots of genuine examples helps teach relevance.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Use alt text and captions thoroughly. Descriptions on images, graphics, video and audio allow AI systems to better index and recommend multimedia.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Emphasize credentials and qualifications. Details on authors, founders, team, certifications, research etc. can signal authority on complex topics to discerning AI.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Include a fair and balanced range of viewpoints. Discussing multiple credible perspectives demonstrates thoughtful consideration of issues, aiding AI systems’ high-level assessments.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Integrate high-quality images, graphics and videos. Visual content allows AI to extract deeper meaning, make connections and better critique multimodal arguments.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Make logical reasoning easy to follow. Use clear numerical reasoning, data visualizations, structured arguments and quality rhetoric to enable AI critique of reasoning process.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Cite recent, peer-reviewed research. Cutting-edge, academically published science and data helps AI determine if analysis reflects state of the art in a field.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Proofread thoroughly. Grammar, spelling and formatting errors may undermine AI confidence in overall quality and expertise demonstrated.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Use clear, readable fonts and sufficient contrast between text and background colors. Avoid excessive text styling. This aids text analysis and extraction. Sans serif fonts like Arial, Helvetica or Verdana tend to score well.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Use color, size and style variations judiciously to highlight titles, headings and calls-to-action. But keep body text clear of excess ornamentation.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   The same clarity and consistency that enhances reading comprehension and user experience for humans also benefits AI content analysis system.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Ensure images are clear, relevant, and enrich content. Images should enhance understanding for both users and AI.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Choose accessible color palettes with sufficient contrast, avoiding combinations that could trigger visual conditions. Neutrals with bright accent colors tend to be safe and appealing options.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise-list">    •   Use white space, size/styling variation and positioning to create a visual hierarchy and guide users to key content and calls-to-action. This enhances scanability for humans and AI.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Optimizing for AI’s advanced reasoning capabilities means demonstrating deep topic expertise, critical thinking, and skill in synthesizing complex ideas.</p>

<p class="fm-exercise">A knowledge graph is a way of storing interconnected information or data that enables the representation of relationships and connections between entities (such as objects, events, situations, or concepts). It’s essentially a graphical representation of a knowledge base, where nodes represent entities and edges represent the relationships between them.

<p class="fm-exercise">Knowledge graphs are widely used in various applications, including search engines (like Google’s Knowledge Graph), recommendation systems, social networks, and artificial intelligence systems.

Here’s GPT’s response:<a id="idIndexMarker063"/><a id="marker-291"/></p>
<table border="0" class="contenttable-c-table" width="100%">
<colgroup class="contenttable-0-colgroup">
<col class="contenttable-0-col" span="1" width="7%"/>
<col class="contenttable-0-col" span="1" width="93%"/>
</colgroup>
<tbody class="contenttable-c-tbody">

<p class="fm-exercise">Data visualization and knowledge graphs are related concepts within the realm of AI and data analysis, but they serve different purposes and are not the same thing.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Imagine you have a bunch of Lego blocks. Each block represents a piece of information.</p><!--<p class="fm-exercise-break">  </p>-->
<p class="fm-exercise">Data Visualization:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Data visualization is like creating a picture or a map out of these Lego blocks. You arrange the blocks in such a way that when you step back, you can easily see a pattern or a shape. This could be anything from a simple bar chart (like stacking blocks to see which pile is tallest) to a complex map showing different data points. The main idea is to help you see the big picture quickly, like how many students prefer pizza over burgers, by just looking at the arrangement of the blocks.<a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker064"/></p><!--<p class="fm-exercise-break">  </p>-->
<p class="fm-exercise">Knowledge Graphs:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Now, imagine instead of just stacking these blocks, you start connecting them with strings based on how they relate to each other. For example, you connect a block representing “you” to another block that represents “your pet dog” with a string labeled “owns.” You might also connect your block to a “school” block with a string labeled “attends.” This network of blocks and strings is like a knowledge graph. It shows not just the blocks (or pieces of information) but also how each block is related to the others through the strings (relationships).<a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker065"/></p><!--<p class="fm-exercise-break">  </p>-->
<p class="fm-exercise">The Difference:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Data Visualization is all about making complex data easy to understand at a glance. It’s like looking at a picture made out of Lego blocks to quickly get what’s going on.<a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker066"/></p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Knowledge Graphs are about showing the relationships between different pieces of information. It’s like seeing how all your Lego blocks are connected with strings, telling a story about how everything is related.<a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker067"/></p>
<p class="fm-exercise">So, while both help us understand information, data visualization is about seeing the big picture quickly, and knowledge graphs are about understanding the relationships and connections between different pieces of information.<a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker068"/><a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker069"/></p>

<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Along with everything else that AI is disrupting, it’s affecting how people search for information on the internet. And therefore, it will require that we website designers switch from SEO to AIO.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Keywords are words or phrases that people looking for a site like yours might use when submitting a query or prompt to a search engine or AI system. It’s important to use the right keywords in your site’s content in the right ways.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">GPT is capable of actually visiting a website and telling you what good keywords for it would be. It can also scan for content and design suggestions.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Google Search Console can help improve your site in several important ways.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Of the many SEO plugins out there, All In One SEO is a popular and excellent choice. It’s comparatively easy to set up and includes powerful features such as a sitemap generator. The free version of this freemium plugin can be sufficient for some sites.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Early search engines used simple quantitative approaches to assess site quality, such as counting keywords. Today, the algorithms include deep data searches, AI judgments, and subtle, human-level analyses. Backlinks (links to your site), especially from highly ranked sites, are still important. They indicate respect for your site’s contents and usability.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Some of the main mistakes to avoid include redundant, offensive, or inaccurate content; ugly or meaningless images; poorly written content; and so on.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">AI is considerably more sensitive, efficient, accurate, and effective when judging the quality of websites than previous search engine systems.<a id="marker-292"/></p>
