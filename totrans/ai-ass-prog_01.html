<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
<p>I started coding back in the early ’80s. My first rig was an Atari 400—not exactly a powerhouse with its membrane keyboard, just 8K of RAM, and programs that loaded from cassettes. I learned the BASIC language and created simple games and utility apps.</p>&#13;
<p>I was totally into it.</p>&#13;
<p>Naturally, over time I upgraded to beefier machines. Along the way, I got my hands dirty with languages like Pascal, C, and C++. But the IDEs didn’t change much, except for syntax highlighting and debugging features.</p>&#13;
<p>Everything changed dramatically with the arrival of GitHub Copilot<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-type="indexterm" id="id259"/> and ChatGPT<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-type="indexterm" id="id260"/>. Trying out these tools felt like the moment I first held an iPhone—absolutely <span class="keep-together">game-changing</span>.</p>&#13;
<p>In natural language, I asked ChatGPT to write code. Or in VS Code, I would type a fragment of a function, and GitHub Copilot would generate a code block. Often it was like hitting the bull’s-eye. Oh, and then I used ChatGPT to turn images into code.</p>&#13;
<p>Yet the real power was that these tools could handle many of the tedious tasks for developers. Who’s into wrestling with regex statements or piecing together bash commands or GitHub actions? Not me, for sure. But these AI programming tools? They eat that stuff for breakfast.</p>&#13;
<p>Turns out, these AI tools are handy for more than just coding. I began using ChatGPT for brainstorming app ideas, drafting requirements, and even knocking out unit tests.</p>&#13;
<p>It didn’t take long for me to be convinced that AI-assisted programming would be one of those must-have skills for programmers.</p>&#13;
<p>So yes, I saw a big need to write this book. I put together an outline and pitched it to O’Reilly. The folks there instantly saw the potential.</p>&#13;
<p>Writing the book has been lots of fun, and I’ve learned a lot. I’ve also interviewed many smart developers who have provided me with great ideas and tips.</p>&#13;
<p>But AI-assisted programming is quickly evolving. This is why this book has a companion <a href="https://github.com/ttaulli/AI-Assisted-Programming-Book">GitHub repository</a>. Here, I’ll make updates to the book and include other important developments in this exciting field.</p>&#13;
<p>So thank you for picking up this book. I hope you find it not only informative but also a valuable guide in your journey.</p>&#13;

This involves topics like brainstorming, market research, requirements documents, and test-driven development.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch08.html#coding">Chapter 8, “Coding”</a>: This chapter goes through common scenarios for development, whether working with APIs, using modular programming, or refactoring. There’s also a look at handling functions and object-oriented programming.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch09.html#debuggingcomma_testingcomma_and_deployme">Chapter 9, “Debugging, Testing, and Deployment”</a>: This chapter is about the less glamorous parts of development. It covers topics like fixing bugs, using AI-assisted programming tools for code reviews, making unit tests, and describing pull requests.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch10.html#takeaways">Chapter 10, “Takeaways”</a>: This is a wrap-up of the book, emphasizing the main points.</p></li>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="How This Book Is Different" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="how_this_book_is_different">&#13;
<h1>How This Book Is Different</h1>&#13;
<p>Software developers thrive on certainty. When you give a program certain input, you always get the same output. For ages, this pure deterministic logic was the heart and soul of software.</p>&#13;
<p>But when you use AI-assisted programming tools, things get a bit topsy-turvy. Getting results is like rolling dice since everything works on probabilities. When you prompt an AI tool to whip up some code, and even use the same prompt over multiple tries, you might get different results each time. Sure, it’s a bit of a head-scratcher at first, but once you get the hang of it, it’s totally worth it. That’s why there is a chapter on prompt engineering that will help with this new approach to programming.</p>&#13;
