    in the details, such as choosing a good typeface, and in the quality and style

    You can select the font size, font family (such as Times Roman), font style (normal
    or italic), weight (how thick the characters’ lines are, for example, **boldface**
    vs. regular), and other qualities such as letter spacing and line height. The
    theme you choose provides some defaults, but you should fine-tune it to best suit
    your topic and audience.

    sites have an easygoing, conversational style. So if you come from a legal, academic,
    or otherwise formal-writing background, you’ll learn in this chapter how to relax
    your writing—how to master a different, more conversational, approach. And AI
    can help you rewrite your text to make it more casual and more appealing to the
    average person.

    .05 seconds! So your visitors’ first impression really counts. This is clearly
    a case of a book being judged by its cover. And AI will prove quite helpful with
    this too, ensuring that you make a confident, positive first impression.

    to display characters that are large enough to be legible. Font size on screens
    is usually specified in *pixels*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DEFINITION The *pixel* or *px* (picture element) refers to the smallest visual
    unit, the individual dots on a digital display. But a pixel isn’t a fixed size,
    like an inch. It’s relative. Pixel size is relative to the size of the screen
    as a whole. So, a jumbotron screen in a football stadium would have brick-size
    pixels, but a tablet’s pixels would likely be too small to be visible to the eye.
    A pixel is that single point of color you can usually see by getting up very close
    to a big-screen TV.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Currently, *multimodality* is an active area of AI research. The idea is that
    a large language model such as GPT should not only learn from text input but also
    from other modalities, including video, graphics, music, even traffic cameras,
    or any other source of information. In other words, they should learn from real-world
    input the way people do (only much faster than we learn, and forgetting nothing,
    ever). The human brain works at roughly several hundred cycles per second. Computers
    do several billion.

- en: At this time, text-to-image generators such as Midjourney learn by harvesting
    images from the internet, and they combine that with text (for example, labeling
    the images by storing the captions they capture). Large language systems such
    as GPT scrape the internet and other databases for text. However, the goal is
    for AI systems to learn from all varieties of information.

    images and video in its learning. But the other AIs are all moving toward multimodality
    for both their input and output.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A related area of continuing research involves allowing users to submit multimodal
    prompts to AI systems. In a limited way, current text-to-image systems do permit
    this. You can upload images to GPT, Google’s Gemini, and Midjourney, in addition
    to text prompts. Then, AI generates its output based on both the images and the
    text. The degree to which the output resembles the submitted images can be adjusted
    on a sliding scale in some systems. Midjourney also permits you to give it images
    for both character reference (content) and/or style reference.

- en: What works well in a wedding planner site (imitations of human handwriting like
    calligraphic or script fonts) wouldn’t work for a sporting goods store such as
    Dick’s. And the formal, conservative Times Roman serif typeface would be most
    appropriate for hospital and bank websites, where reliability and trustworthiness
    must be conveyed. However, most sites should choose a sans serif typeface (plain,
    no curlicues, and little variation in line width). Popular sans serif choices
    are Arial, Verdana, and Helvetica.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Tip The terms *typeface, font,* and *font family* are often used interchangeably,
    but we’ll use *typeface* to refer to the overall design of the letters, that is,
    their shapes (such as Arial or Times Roman), and we’ll use *font* when describing
    qualities of a typeface such as font size or font style. There are hundreds of
    typefaces to choose from with various characteristics: thick or thin; varied line
    shapes and thicknesses; minimalistic or ornate; curlicues; blocky; geometric;
    and even strange, specialized typefaces that feature spiderwebs to look macabre

    isn’t the only criterion (Consolas is quite readable), Consolas should be avoided
    because it’s simply unattractive. Cambria is also readable, but it’s a serif font

    in line thickness on some letters (see the lowercase letters in figure 4.1) giving

    color, but a different level of darkness.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some poorly designed sites have dark font colors against dark backgrounds, or
    vice versa—light against light. Obviously, this lack of contrast makes the text
    hard to read. It’s particularly frustrating for people with poor eyesight. Text
    should contrast against its background. This generally means text that’s black
    or dark against a background that’s white or light. The best choice is usually
    just plain old reliable black and white. And the background shouldn’t *compete*
    with the text—so no wallpaper or vivid images under the text. In matters like
    backgrounds, subtlety is to be preferred.

    perfected. Watch their behavior as friends or relatives try different versions
    of your home page. One version is likely to have the most successful CTA. And
    install the analytics plugins that we’ll look at later in the book. They show
    you how your visitors behave, where they came from, what pathways through your
    site they took, how long they viewed different pages, and other data that can
    help you improve the site.'

    and quality of your site. Think about adding a couple of brief, glowing comments
    from visitors to the home page. It’s good to display the names, locations, and
    photos of these people to make them seem more authentic. Also perhaps include
    an interior page with additional testimonials. Testimonials are slightly different
    from reviews—the former are entirely positive, but the latter, to be believed,
    must contain at least a few critical comments.'

    site design. You first explored ways to choose the best typeface, and associated
    qualities, that will make your text content look great. Next, you saw ways to
    achieve a writing style that makes your audience want to read what you have to
    say. And the chapter concluded by putting what you’ve learned so far into action:
    creating a compelling home page.'

    your site with the click of a button. They include utilities such as spam blockers
    or features for your site’s visitors, such as an events calendar. We’ll also see
    how you can create your own custom plugins by describing what you want to an AI.

- en: Typography is a more important factor in a site’s success than many realize.
    Your theme will likely specify some defaults—typeface, size, and other font elements—but
    you should see if these choices might be improved.

    site must convey solidity and seriousness—such as legal or academic sites—people
    generally expect an informal tone.

    of your call to action (CTA). People make snap judgements pretty fast when they
    first visit a site, and unless you impress them, they’re gone.
