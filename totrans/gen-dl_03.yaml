    and see how it is the natural counterpart to the more widely studied discriminative
    modeling. We will then establish a framework that describes the desirable properties
    that a good generative model should have. We will also lay out the core probabilistic
    concepts that are important to know, in order to fully appreciate how different
    approaches tackle the challenge of generative modeling.

    of horses. We can *train* a generative model on this dataset to capture the rules
    that govern the complex relationships between pixels in images of horses. Then
    we can *sample* from this model to create novel, realistic images of horses that
    did not exist in the original dataset. This process is illustrated in [Figure 1-1](#generative_model).

    examples of the entity we are trying to generate. This is known as the *training
    data*, and one such data point is called an *observation*.
  id: totrans-10
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each observation consists of many *features*. For an image generation problem,
    the features are usually the individual pixel values; for a text generation problem,
    the features could be individual words or groups of letters. It is our goal to
    build a model that can generate new sets of features that look as if they have
    been created using the same rules as the original data. Conceptually, for image
    generation this is an incredibly difficult task, considering the vast number of
    ways that individual pixel values can be assigned and the relatively tiny number
    of such arrangements that constitute an image of the entity we are trying to generate.
  id: totrans-11

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A generative model must also be *probabilistic* rather than *deterministic*,
    because we want to be able to sample many different variations of the output,
    rather than get the same output every time. If our model is merely a fixed calculation,
    such as taking the average value of each pixel in the training dataset, it is
    not generative. A generative model must include a random component that influences
    the individual samples generated by the model.
  id: totrans-12

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words, we can imagine that there is some unknown probabilistic distribution
    that explains why some images are likely to be found in the training dataset and
    other images are not. It is our job to build a model that mimics this distribution
    as closely as possible and then sample from it to generate new, distinct observations
    that look as if they could have been included in the original training set.

- en: In order to truly understand what generative modeling aims to achieve and why
    this is important, it is useful to compare it to its counterpart, *discriminative
    modeling*. If you have studied machine learning, most problems you will have faced
    will have most likely been discriminative in nature. To understand the difference,
    let’s look at an example.
  id: totrans-15

- en: Suppose we have a dataset of paintings, some painted by Van Gogh and some by
    other artists. With enough data, we could train a discriminative model to predict
    if a given painting was painted by Van Gogh. Our model would learn that certain
    colors, shapes, and textures are more likely to indicate that a painting is by
    the Dutch master, and for paintings with these features, the model would upweight
    its prediction accordingly. [Figure 1-2](#discriminative_model) shows the discriminative
    modeling process—note how it differs from the generative modeling process shown
    in [Figure 1-1](#generative_model).

- en: When performing discriminative modeling, each observation in the training data
    has a *label*. For a binary classification problem such as our artist discriminator,
    Van Gogh paintings would be labeled 1 and non–Van Gogh paintings labeled 0\. Our
    model then learns how to discriminate between these two groups and outputs the
    probability that a new observation has label 1—i.e., that it was painted by Van
    Gogh.

    it concerns itself with generating entirely new images, rather than trying to

    model to identify Van Gogh paintings, it would still have no idea how to create
    a painting that looks like a Van Gogh. It can only output probabilities against
    existing images, as this is what it has been trained to do. We would instead need
    to train a generative model and sample from this model to generate images that
    have a high chance of belonging to the original training dataset.

- en: Until recently, discriminative modeling has been the driving force behind most
    progress in machine learning. This is because for any discriminative problem,
    the corresponding generative modeling problem is typically much more difficult
    to tackle. For example, it is much easier to train a model to predict if a painting
    is by Van Gogh than it is to train a model to generate a Van Gogh–style painting
    from scratch. Similarly, it is much easier to train a model to predict if a page
    of text was written by Charles Dickens than it is to build a model to generate
    a set of paragraphs in the style of Dickens. Until recently, most generative challenges
    were simply out of reach and many doubted that they could ever be solved. Creativity
    was considered a purely human capability that couldn’t be rivaled by AI.

    been more readily applicable to practical problems across industry than generative
    modeling. For example, a doctor may benefit from a model that predicts if a given

- en: Firstly, purely from a theoretical point of view, we shouldn’t limit our machine
    training to simply categorizing data. For completeness, we should also be concerned
    with training models that capture a more complete understanding of the data distribution,
    beyond any particular label. This is undoubtedly a more difficult problem to solve,
    due to the high dimensionality of the space of feasible outputs and the relatively
    small number of creations that we would class as belonging to the dataset. However,
    as we shall see, many of the same techniques that have driven development in discriminative
    modeling, such as deep learning, can be utilized by generative models too.
  id: totrans-35
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 首先，从理论角度来看，我们不应该将机器训练仅限于简单地对数据进行分类。为了完整性，我们还应该关注训练能够捕捉数据分布更完整理解的模型，超越任何特定标签。这无疑是一个更难解决的问题，因为可行输出空间的维度很高，我们将归类为数据集的创作数量相对较少。然而，正如我们将看到的，许多推动辨别建模发展的相同技术，如深度学习，也可以被生成模型利用。
- en: Secondly, as we shall see in [Chapter 12](ch12.xhtml#chapter_world_models),
    generative modeling is now being used to drive progress in other fields of AI,
    such as reinforcement learning (the study of teaching agents to optimize a goal
    in an environment through trial and error). Suppose we want to train a robot to
    walk across a given terrain. A traditional approach would be to run many experiments
    where the agent tries out different strategies in the terrain, or a computer simulation
    of the terrain. Over time the agent would learn which strategies are more successful
    than others and therefore gradually improve. A challenge with this approach is
    that it is fairly inflexible because it is trained to optimize the policy for
    one particular task. An alternative approach that has recently gained traction
    is to instead train the agent to learn a *world model* of the environment using
    a generative model, independent of any particular task. The agent can quickly
    adapt to new tasks by testing strategies in its own world model, rather than in
    the real environment, which is often computationally more efficient and does not
    require retraining from scratch for each new task.

  zh: 其次，正如我们将在[第12章](ch12.xhtml#chapter_world_models)中看到，生成建模现在被用于推动其他领域的人工智能进步，如强化学习（通过试错来教导代理优化环境中的目标）。假设我们想训练一个机器人在给定地形上行走。传统方法是在环境中运行许多实验，其中代理尝试不同的策略，或者在地形的计算机模拟中尝试。随着时间的推移，代理将学会哪些策略比其他策略更成功，因此逐渐改进。这种方法的挑战在于它相当僵化，因为它被训练来优化一个特定任务的策略。最近开始流行的另一种方法是，代替训练代理人学习环境的*世界模型*，使用生成模型，独立于任何特定任务。代理可以通过在自己的世界模型中测试策略，而不是在真实环境中测试，来快速适应新任务，这通常在计算上更有效，并且不需要为每个新任务从头开始重新训练。
- en: Finally, if we are to truly say that we have built a machine that has acquired
    a form of intelligence that is comparable to a human’s, generative modeling must
    surely be part of the solution. One of the finest examples of a generative model
    in the natural world is the person reading this book. Take a moment to consider
    what an incredible generative model you are. You can close your eyes and imagine
    what an elephant would look like from any possible angle. You can imagine a number
    of plausible different endings to your favorite TV show, and you can plan your
    week ahead by working through various futures in your mind’s eye and taking action
    accordingly. Current neuroscientific theory suggests that our perception of reality
    is not a highly complex discriminative model operating on our sensory input to
    produce predictions of what we are experiencing, but is instead a generative model
    that is trained from birth to produce simulations of our surroundings that accurately
    match the future. Some theories even suggest that the output from this generative
    model is what we directly perceive as reality. Clearly, a deep understanding of
    how we can build machines to acquire this ability will be central to our continued
    understanding of the workings of the brain and general artificial intelligence.

    model the high-dimensional sample space directly, we describe each observation
    in the training set using some lower-dimensional *latent space* and then learn
    a mapping function that can take a point in the latent space and map it to a point
    in the original domain. In other words, each point in the latent space is a *representation*
    of some high-dimensional observation.

    image of a tin to a point in a latent space of just two dimensions, even though
    the training set of images is provided in high-dimensional pixel space. Notably,
    this means that we can also produce images of tins that do not exist in the training
    set, by applying a suitable mapping function <math alttext="f"><mi>f</mi></math>

    width are the two latent space dimensions that best describe this dataset, then
    learn the mapping function <math alttext="f"><mi>f</mi></math> that can take a
    point in this space and map it to a grayscale biscuit tin image. Machine learning
    (and specifically, deep learning) gives us the ability to train machines that
    can find these complex relationships without human guidance.

    can perform operations that affect high-level properties of the image by manipulating
    its representation vector within the more manageable latent space. For example,
    it is not obvious how to adjust the shading of every single pixel to make an image
    of a biscuit tin *taller*. However, in the latent space, it’s simply a case of
    increasing the *height* latent dimension, then applying the mapping function to
    return to the image domain. We shall see an explicit example of this in the next
    chapter, applied not to biscuit tins but to faces.

    to many generative modeling techniques, as we shall see in later chapters of this
    book. Mathematically speaking, *encoder-decoder* techniques try to transform the
    highly nonlinear *manifold* on which the data lies (e.g., in pixel space) into
    a simpler latent space that can be sampled from, so that it is likely that any
    point in the latent space is the representation of a well-formed image, as shown
