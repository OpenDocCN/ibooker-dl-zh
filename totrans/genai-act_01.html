   <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is familiar and has been around for years. We all use it when we use a search engine, read a product recommendation, listen to a curated playlist, or use the suggested words as we type on a phone—all these actions are powered by AI. However, everything seems new in AI today, with the world on fire talking about it, specifically about generative AI.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p8"> 
   <p>Generative AI, a fascinating and unique advancement in AI technology, has garnered public interest and ignited global enthusiasm. OpenAI's ChatGPT has significantly boosted its popularity, attracting 100 million users in two months—the fastest user adoption of any technology in human history. Many businesses view this technology as the key driver for the next wave of digital transformation and automation. Generative AI creates new content and processes that can enhance various business operations. It is already being used to generate a wide range of content, from images, text, and music to more complex outputs, such as design patterns and code. Its potential is vast and exciting, capable of generating almost anything—from new game levels to novel recipes and much more. </p>

   <p>This book explores various aspects of this emerging technology. We will discuss practical use cases and how businesses can integrate generative AI into existing frameworks. Furthermore, we will explore its technical foundations, critical components, and the necessary modifications in application architecture. Additionally, we will examine the most effective practices for implementing AI in a production environment and managing its operation optimally.</p>

   <p>Generative AI fundamentally differs from other types of AI, as it is about creating something new that is not modified or copied from its training data. Whereas traditional AI makes predictions based on input data, generative models create new things by predicting the next set of words based on their ability to generate and understand the semantics of the real world. These new things span a wide range of text, images, music, and 3D models. We will see how enterprises can adapt to using these new techniques. Generative AI, akin to an imaginative artist or an inventive novelist, paints vivid pictures from fragments of information, writes poetry that touches the soul, and builds whole universes from thin air. Welcome, dear readers, to the awe-inspiring world of generative AI—a realm where machines learn to understand, analyze, and create.</p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p14"> 
   <p>After reading this book, you will have gained a thorough understanding of generative AI and its applications in an enterprise. The book covers fundamental technologies and principles of generative AI, including foundational models, large language models, embeddings, and related algorithms and architectures. It will provide the knowledge needed to identify and implement the steps to incorporate generative AI into your organization’s AI strategies and projects. Additionally, the book presents real-world use cases and guides to developing and deploying generative AI models in enterprise settings. It also explores emerging applications of architecture patterns, best practices, and integration patterns with existing systems and enterprise workflows. The book highlights emerging tools and trends that enterprises should know, including prompt engineering, explainable AI, transfer learning, and reinforcement learning (specifically reinforcement learning from human feedback, or RLHF).</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p15"> 
   <p>This book is intended for a diverse audience, including developers, software architects, data scientists, business decision-makers, and power users working in enterprises across all sectors. The examples of real-world enterprise scenarios primarily focus on the technical aspects and demonstrate how generative AI can address the distinct challenges many enterprises face. The fundamental principles discussed here apply equally to smaller organizations and startups. In addition, we will examine the challenges and risks associated with generative AI, such as using corporate and private data, ethical considerations, data privacy, security, and safety considerations, to enable informed decision-making when integrating these technologies into organizations.</p>

   </div> 
   <div class="readable-text" id="p17"> 
    <p>The book mainly uses Azure OpenAI and OpenAI, the top LLM models and platforms for publication. They have been in production for almost two years (at the time of writing) and are the most stable, tested, and ready for cloud-scale enterprise use. Thousands of enterprises depend on and use these platforms. </p> 
   </div> 
   <div class="readable-text" id="p18"> 
    <p>The goal is to help you understand generative AI and how to use new technology for your enterprises. Even if you use a different LLM, these concepts and primitives are the same. In the book, we will also see examples of other LLMs and providers, how the concepts are the same, and how the APIs and SDKs are similar to OpenAI. We also cover various open-source models in depth. </p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p23"> 
   <p> As shown in figure 1.2, generative AI is a subsection of AI that is trained on a vast array of data to learn the underlying patterns and distributions. The magic lies in its potential to generate something novel and original, a task previously believed to be the sole domain of human ingenuity.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p24"> 
   <p><strong> </strong>Machine and deep learning provide the fundamental techniques we need to understand before diving into generative AI. They give us the toolkit to navigate the landscape of AI and understand the processes behind data engineering, model training, and inference. As we progress through this book, we will apply these principles but will not get into the details. Multiple books have been dedicated to both topics, and it would be more prudent for the reader to consult those for details.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p25"> 
   <p>At its simplest, machine learning (ML) is the scientific discipline focusing on how computers can learn from data. Instead of explicitly programming computers to carry out tasks, in ML, we develop algorithms that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. This data-driven decision-making is applicable to numerous real-world scenarios, ranging from spam filtering in emails to recommendation systems on e-commerce platforms.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p26"> 
   <p>Deep learning (DL), a subset of ML, takes this concept further. It uses artificial neural networks with several layers. These networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit in a simplified form—to learn from large amounts of data. While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help optimize its accuracy. DL drives many AI applications today and helps execute tasks with improved efficiency, speed, and scale.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p27"> 
   <p>An AI model is a sophisticated algorithmic structure trained on extensive datasets to autonomously perform specific tasks such as text generation, translation, and decision-making. These models learn from data patterns to mimic human cognitive abilities, which enables them to understand and generate natural language. Once trained, developers should recognize that these models can process and analyze data independently, using ML and DL techniques. ML models apply mathematical frameworks to data for predictions, while DL models use neural networks for complex tasks involving unstructured data. In essence, an AI model is a self-sufficient tool that can carry out intelligent tasks based on learned data patterns after training, which are crucial for creating smart applications.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p28"> 
   <p>Generative AI is an evolution of DL. Many incorrectly assume that ChatGPT is generative AI. ChatGPT is a web application that uses generative AI at its simplest level. The rise and popularity of ChatGPT exposed many folks to generative AI, and the power of the other generative models called large language models (LLMs) is, as the name suggests, related to language. OpenAI trained ChatGPT on diverse internet text to produce a human-like conversation. In addition to ChatGPT, table 1.1 outlines some of the key generative AI models used today; these are grouped by generated AI area types: language, image, and code generation.</p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p38"> 
   <p>When it comes to generating things using generative AI, the sky is the limit. As discussed earlier, we can generate text, images, music, code, voice, and even designs. Before we look at some examples of things that can be generated, it is worth noting that generative AI does not understand the content as humans do. It uses patterns in the data (part of its training set) to generate new, similar data—the quality and relevance of the generated content are directly correlated to the quality and relevance of the training data.</p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p40"> 
   <p>We can use generative AI, specifically a large language model (LLM), to extract entities from text. Entities are pieces of information that are of interest to us. In the past, we would need to use a named entity recognition (NER) model for entity extraction; furthermore, that model would need to have seen the data and be trained as part of its dataset. With LLM models, we can do this without any training, and they are more accurate. While traditional NER methods are effective, they often require manual effort and domain-specific customization. LLMs have significantly reduced this burden, offering a more efficient and often more accurate approach to NER across various domains. A key reason is the Transformer architecture, which we will cover in the next few chapters. This is a great example of traditional AI being more rigid and less flexible than generative AI.</p>

   <p>Generating text in many ways is the bread and butter of generative AI. We can generate different things, such as poems, jokes, and personalized content.

  <div class="readable-text" id="p70"> 
   <p>We are not restricted to only text—we can generate images using a prompt. To be clear, the model does not find a similar image that satisfies these attributes; rather, it generates something new that does not exist. It does not matter if we ask for something whimsical that will not exist in the real world, such as a dog writing a book with the Taj Mahal in the background. The AI can deconstruct and comprehend each aspect and then use that to create something new, similar to how an artist would. In figure 1.4, we use OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 model to generate the images from the prompt.</p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p74"> 
   <p>When thinking about generating code, it is helpful to think of AI not as being able to create fully functioning applications but rather as being able to create some functions and routines. A lot of code is about scaffolding of different runtimes and frameworks and less about the exact business logic. In many of these scenarios, code generation can help improve the developer’s productivity. In the following example, we use GPT-3.5 to generate code for a classic “Hello, World!” function. We can give it a prompt such as the following, and it will generate the code for us.</p>

   <p>Generative AI, however, can comprehend the intent of the question because it has a broader understanding of the world and can generate step-by-step processes. Another aspect that allows this is the emergent behavior of generative AI models. This behavior is the ability to outline a step-by-step process. It is not present in any of the individual components of the model but emerges from the interaction of the components.

For example, as shown in figure 1.6, we can use a prompt such as “Create a meditative song that is calming and soothing with flutes and guitars.

  <div class="readable-text" id="p116"> 
   <p>The Generative AI sector is on a steep upward trajectory, with market value estimations soaring from $1.75B in 2022 to a projected $33B by 2027 and an impressive CAGR of 80% [2]. Industry experts from Bloomberg Intelligence forecast a staggering market expansion to $1.3 trillion in a decade, a leap from the $40B recorded in 2022 [3]. GenAI's widespread adoption is evident in various industries, including financial services and customer relationship management, driven by its capacity to enhance insights and productivity. Considering Gartner’s prediction that 90% of service providers will incorporate GenAI for software development by 2027 [4], it’s clear that generative AI is not just reshaping existing business landscapes but also paving the way for novel market prospects. Enterprises are swiftly integrating GenAI into their offerings, positioning themselves at the forefront of this technological revolution and the myriad of opportunities it presents.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p117"> 
   <p>Generative AI is a powerful technology that can create new content or data from existing ones. Many enterprises use it for different use cases inside and outside their organizations. Some of these are for improving their workflow or efficiency, while others provide better services or products to their customers. Depending on the purpose, the challenges of using generative AI vary. For instance, one common challenge is when the AI system produces something that does not make sense (i.e., it makes up things—also called hallucinations). This is usually easier to handle internally than externally because customers might have higher expectations or lower trust in the AI system.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p118"> 
   <p>There are many reasons why an AI system tends to hallucinate, but it is often because the underlying model cannot distinguish between facts and fiction in its training data. LLMs are trained to generate coherent, context-aware text rather than factually accurate responses. They tend to hallucinate when the prompt or context is inaccurate but relevant to the task. We will cover hallucinations and techniques that can be used to reduce them later in the book.</p>

   <h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_16"><span class="num-string">1.5</span> When not to use generative AI</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p124"> 
   <p>Using generative AI in an enterprise environment differs greatly from individuals using it for personal reasons. Organizations must follow certain regulations and expectations that apply to their industries, some of which will vary by location. In addition, there are other financial, legal, technical, and moral considerations. What if the AI-generated content is incorrect, full of bias, or just plain offensive—what problems would that cause? For example, there is little harm if an AI chatbot messes up a recipe, but it is a whole different story if it gives bad instructions to someone fixing a complex piece of machinery.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p125"> 
   <p>If enterprises do not set up proper ethical guidelines for generative AI, it could lead to unintended consequences. Generative AI can create misinformation and fake content, including fake news articles, fake images, sensitive content, and malicious content. A picture is not worth a thousand words anymore; some images are so good that it is getting increasingly difficult to distinguish fake from real images. In some cases, the generated output could also infringe on third-party copyrighted material. Adding human oversight and contribution can help address some of these challenges.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p126"> 
   <p>Generative AI models can also unintentionally amplify biases present in training data, leading to problematic outputs that perpetuate stereotypes and harmful ideologies. They can also generate fabricated or nonsensical responses not grounded in facts (i.e., hallucinations).</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p127"> 
   <p>Companies need a solid plan for using generative AI and ensuring it aligns with their business goals, such as how it will affect sales, marketing, commerce, service, and IT jobs. Where there are life-and-death decisions, ensure a human is in the loop, making the final decision with the AI as a copilot and assisting.</p>

   <h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_17"><span class="num-string">1.6</span> How is generative AI different from traditional AI?</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p129"> 
   <p>Traditional AI, which some now refer to as narrow AI, is predominantly the common form of AI we encounter today. It uses classical data science and a systematic approach to extracting insights and knowledge from data using various methods and techniques. It typically involves the following steps: data collection, data preparation, data analysis, feature engineering, training, and data validation. Traditional AI predicts things operating within pre-established boundaries on which it has been trained. These boundaries are the rules and instructions that are coded in a model. It can only act based on predefined conditions, constraints, and potential outcomes. Thus, the outcome is deterministic and relatively predictable. For instance, a traditional AI could be programmed to automate customer service through chatbots by generating responses based on predefined scripts. While these systems are highly effective within their prescribed domain, they stay within their lanes and cannot learn and adapt to situations outside their programmed knowledge—hence the narrow aspect. Almost all the AI implementations that enterprises have done thus far are traditional AI.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p130"> 
   <p>In contrast, generative AI leans toward a probabilistic approach, where the outcome is calculated based on probabilities influenced by the input data and learned patterns. This allows these AI systems to create outputs that were neither hard-coded nor explicitly taught to the system. Generative AI needs the classical data science process, which enhances and complements it in many ways. Generative AI can help deal with new types of data and content, evaluate the quality and validity of generated outputs, and ensure the ethical and responsible use of generative AI. Classical data science and generative AI must work together to create value and impact from data.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p131"> 
   <p>One significant difference is that the modality to talk to these newer generative AI models is by using a prompt, as we have seen in the examples. More formally, a prompt is a set of instructions that tells the generative AI system what kind of content we want to create. The better the prompt, the better the results. A prompt should be tailored to the type of response you want to receive and to the specifics of the generative AI you use. We will cover prompt engineering in more detail later.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p132"> 
   <p>Prompting allows us to be more expressive and not only outline the requirements and the intent, but also capture empathy and emotion via language. Prompt engineering is a new, rising area for developers and enterprises, and is more art and less science.</p>

   <p>Table 1.4 outlines broad categories to show differences between generative and traditional AI architectures. It is also important to note that there is much overlap between different types of AI. For example, a chatbot might use both generative and predictive models, generating responses based on a learned understanding of language and predicting what type of response a user will likely find most helpful.</p>

      <td>  Relative to generative AI, traditional AI models are less complex and require fewer computing resources, allowing them to run on various hardware, from small edge devices to large cloud clusters and everything in between. This flexibility cloud-to-edge is a huge advantage for enterprises. <br/>  Generative models are large and complex; for the most part, they are available only on large cloud compute nodes via an API, which has other advantages, such as the knowledge of the world encoded in these foundational models being available to everyone. However, there are other constraints that one needs to consider. <br/>  Note: There is a growing set of smaller open-source models that can be run on-premises, but today, they are still more experimental and nascent. Many claim to be AI Quality (AIQ), similar to OpenAI’s models. Given the broad spectrum that generative AI covers, there is a new emerging set of benchmarks, such as Stanford’s Holistic Evaluation of Language Model (HELM), and Hugging Face recently published an Open LLM Leaderboard. We will cover these in depth later in the book when talking about evaluations and benchmarks. <br/></td>

   <h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_18"><span class="num-string">1.7</span> What approach should enterprises take?</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p141"> 
   <p>Generative AI can offset the limitations of traditional data-driven AI systems and offer an extraordinary toolkit to build smarter applications and systems; for enterprises, the possibilities are vast and exciting. Imagine designing systems that self-optimize over time or developing AI assistants (Copilots) that can draft emails and reports, generate code snippets, and so on, thereby improving productivity and reducing time-to-market.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p142"> 
   <p>Many organizations may fall for the excitement and fear of missing out on generative AI, which appears to be magical. However, the truth is that having a foundational model such as GPT-4, a big language model, does not make any difference by itself. These advanced AI systems must be implemented and connected to the enterprise’s business lines and processes like any other external software. We will see examples of how to implement this in subsequent chapters. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p143"> 
   <p>At a high level, there should be few changes from an overall approach; enterprises are still advised to take a thoughtful and strategic approach when incorporating generative AI. The following are a few key considerations—these span various dimensions that most enterprises need to consider, from strategic to business to technical:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p144"> <em>Crawl, walk, and run</em><em>. </em>Start small, and do not rush in to do too much too soon. Start with a small pilot project to evaluate, learn, and adapt. This is a complex technology, and it takes time to develop and deploy effective generative AI applications. Do not expect to see results overnight. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p145"> <em>Define clear objectives and the right use cases</em><em>. </em>It is important for enterprises to carefully evaluate potential use cases and select those that are most likely to deliver value. The selected use case will guide the choice of AI models, data preparation, and resource allocations. Some generative AI applications are more mature and have a proven record of success, while others are still in their early days. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p146"> <em>Establish governance policies</em><em>. </em>Generative AI can generate data, some of which may be sensitive or harmful. Enterprises must establish governance policies to ensure this data is used responsibly and securely. These policies should address problems such as data ownership, privacy, and security. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p147"> <em>Establish responsible AI and ethical governance</em><em>. </em>Considering the ethical implications of using generative AI is important. Establish a separate responsible AI and ethical set of policies that reflect the company’s values and that are important to managing its reputation and brand. This includes concerns around bias in AI outputs, the potential misuse of generated content, hallucinations and incorrect details in generated content, and the implications of automating tasks that humans previously performed. A robust AI governance and ethics framework can help manage these risks. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p148"> <em>Experiment and iterate</em><em>. </em>Unlike computer science, AI, particularly generative AI, is nondeterministic, and depending on the model parameters and settings, the output can be quite different. As with any AI application, it is essential to take an iterative approach when implementing generative AI. Start with smaller projects, learn from the outcomes, and gradually scale up. This approach helps to manage risk and gain practical experience. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p149"> <em>Design for failure</em><em>. </em>Most generative AI models today are commercially available as cloud APIs. As such, they are complex and have a considerable latency compared to more traditional APIs. Enterprises should adhere to cloud best practices and design for failure. They should also factor in best practices of retry mechanics, including exponential backoff policies, caching, security, etc. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p150"> <em>Expand existing architecture</em><em>. </em>These new generative AI endpoints are just additional pieces of the overall system. As such, most organizations will want to keep their existing architecture guidance and practices and expand their existing architecture and best practices, rather than starting from scratch. New constructs, such as context windows, tokens, and embeddings, need to be incorporated. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p151"> <em>Bring your data</em><em>. </em>One of the main differentiators enterprises have is their proprietary data and associated prompts; therefore, determining how one can utilize their proprietary internal data when using GenAI-powered applications is crucial. This needs to be anchored in the use cases at hand, and if not managed properly, it can get complex quickly, which will be covered in later chapters when we talk about RAG. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p152"> <em>Manage cost</em><em>. </em>Generative AI is complex and much more expensive. The cost is typically measured differently (such as in tokens) and not in API calls. Much of this is new and different for enterprises, and the costs can easily get out of hand. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p153"> <em>Complement traditional AI</em><em>. </em>In most cases, generative AI would help assist existing investment in traditional AI that enterprises already have. Both sets of technologies are not mutually exclusive but rather support each other. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p154"> <em>Open-source versus commercial models</em><em>. </em>Some models are commercially available, such as Azure OpenAI’s GPT models, and some are open source, such as Stable Diffusion. Depending on the use case, it is important to validate which models to use, what the licensing allows, and what legal and regulatory aspects are already covered. </li> 
  </ul>

   <h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_19"><span class="num-string">1.8</span> Architecture considerations</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p156"> 
   <p>Suppose you are an enterprise developer who is seeing all the news on generative AI and the various product announcements from major technology companies. In that case, you might think that for AI, everything has changed. Still, in reality, nothing has changed. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p157"> 
   <p>From an enterprise perspective, there are new aspects of generative AI that one needs to consider—most, if not all, of these would be things to add to existing architecture best practices and guidance, rather than throwing out anything. We will cover the details later in the book, but new architectural patterns must be accounted for at a high level. We have already touched on many of these, but the key ones are</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p158"> <em>Prompts</em><em> </em>—We will see how to assess engineering and managing aspects around prompts, including tokens and context windows. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p159"> <em>Model adaptation</em><em> </em>—The aim is to make the output better for specific tasks. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p160"> <em>Integrating generative AI into existing enterprise line-of-business systems</em><em> </em>—These new AI models alone do not solve a business problem. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p161"> <em>Design for failure</em><em> </em>—This aspect is nothing new per se when building mission-critical systems, but many still take shortcuts. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p162"> <em>Cost and ROI</em><em> </em><em>—</em>These generative AI systems are tremendously expensive because the underlying compute is very expensive as well. The costs will come down over time, but they must be consciously planned and designed up front. For example, the cost of GPT-3.5 Turbo from OpenAI came down by 90%, and its quality went up by 90% compared to GPT-3 [5]. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p163"> <em>Implement policies and approaches for open source (OSS) versus commercial models</em><em> </em><em>—</em>Each week, newer models power AI systems and are released. Some are commercial and others are OSS, with different licensing structures. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p164"> <em>Vendor</em><em> </em><em>—</em>There are a few vendors in production that enterprises can use today, but more are coming soon. Today, two of the most mature are OpenAI and Azure OpenAI. The former targets smaller companies and startups, whereas the latter targets enterprises. Google is also releasing its generative AI suite on Google Cloud, and there have been similar announcements from Amazon. In addition, many well-funded startups have announced similar products, such as Anthropic and Mistral. Enterprises need to consider each as a vendor and identify which one they would want to utilize and depend on. </li>

   <h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_20"><span class="num-string">1.9</span> So your enterprise wants to use generative AI. Now what?</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p166"> 
   <p>Your enterprise has taken a critical step toward using generative AI to drive innovation and efficiency. However, understanding what comes next is crucial to maximizing the benefits and mitigating the risks of this advanced technology. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p167"> 
   <p>To get started, we will use the example of implementing an Enterprise ChatGPT and outline the steps needed at a high level. Throughout the next few chapters, we will dig into more technical details, including guidance on implementation and best practices. Figure 1.7 shows a high-level overview of what a typical workflow in an enterprise might look like.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p169"> 
   <p>You should start by setting clear goals for your chatbot. What challenges do you want to address with generative AI? How can it help you the most? This could be anything from creating content for marketing to enhancing customer service with chatbots, forecasting for business plans, or even innovating new products or services. In our example, we are building an Enterprise ChatGPT, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, but one that is deployed and runs in an enterprise environment, using internal and proprietary data, and only authorized users can access it.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p170"> 
   <p>Next, we need to ensure that we have the necessary resources available, that is, people with the right competencies, a suitable hardware and software framework, defining indicators of success, and the appropriate governance and ethics principles in place.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p171"> 
   <p>Then, consider the data. In our example, the enterprise chatbot would need access to relevant, high-quality enterprise data that the user can employ. This data needs to be ingested and indexed to help answer proprietary questions. Before that, the data must be managed properly, ensuring privacy and legal compliance. Remember, the quality of the data fed will influence the output quality.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p172"> 
   <p>Next, we need to integrate the enterprise chatbot into the line of business applications that address the use case and the problem we are trying to address. As an enterprise, we will also want to address the risks associated with generative AI and implement corporate guidance around safety and responsible AI.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p173"> 
   <p>Lastly, although we might be ready to deploy in production, implementing generative AI is not a one-time event but a journey. It requires continuous monitoring, testing, and fine-tuning to ensure it works optimally and responsibly. It’s a good idea to start with smaller, manageable projects and gradually scale up as you gain more confidence and expertise in handling this powerful technology.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p174"> 
   <p>Adopting generative AI is a significant commitment that could transform your enterprise, but it requires careful planning, appropriate resources, ongoing monitoring, and an unwavering focus on ethical considerations. With these in place, your enterprise can reap the numerous benefits of generative AI.</p>
