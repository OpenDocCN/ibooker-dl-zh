    which treats a piece of music as a multidimensional object akin to an image, and
    Music Transformer, which treats a piece of music as a sequence of musical events.
    Chapter 15 introduces you to diffusion models, which form the foundation of all
    leading text-to-image Transformers (such as DALL-E 2 or Imagen). Chapter 16 uses
    the LangChain library to combine pretrained large language models with Wolfram
    Alpha and Wikipedia APIs to create a zero-shot know-it-all personal assistant.'
