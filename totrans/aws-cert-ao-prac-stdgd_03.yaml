    challenges at Amazon. The company’s codebase and data systems had become massive
    and complex, making them [difficult to change and maintain](https://oreil.ly/SGSgQ).
    To continue scaling its growth, Amazon needed a significant architectural change.

    technology (IT) infrastructure. The strategy involved breaking the monolithic
    codebase into smaller, independent components called *microservices*. Each microservice
    would handle a specific task, such as authentication, storage, or database updates.
    This approach enabled smaller, more agile developer teams, leading to faster development
    cycles—a concept famously embodied by the “two-pizza rule,” where teams were small
    enough to be fed with just two pizzas.

    to simplify and automate time-consuming tasks like load balancing and data center
    management. This platform allowed developers to provision services easily without
    managing the complex underlying infrastructure, freeing them to focus on coding,
    debugging, and deployment.

- en: Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet
    with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical
    data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing
    power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like
    Amazon Web Services (AWS).
  prefs:

    you can access computing services whenever you want. This is done through the
    AWS Management Console, the command-line interface (CLI), or a software development
    kit (SDK).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These computing services are virtualized. This is where physical hardware, like
    a server, is shared by multiple users. This is done by using sophisticated technologies
    like hypervisors and containerization, which allow for more efficient and effective
    usage of IT resources. These essentially create isolated environments, with their
    own operating systems. This makes it seem like you have your own dedicated system,
    which you can configure for your requirements.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The public cloud is the most common. It is what’s at the core of AWS, as well
    as Microsoft’s Azure and the Google Cloud Service. The cloud provider builds and
    maintains the infrastructure and compute resources. These are then shared among
    the customers, which is called the *multi-tenant model*. This allows for more
    efficiency and lower costs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    party for critical operations. There is also the concern about security. Then
    again, AWS does have strong systems in place for this, such as with IAM, encryption,
    and System and Organization Controls (SOC) compliance. They also have 24/7 monitoring
    of its infrastructure.
  prefs: []

    builds and manages its own IT infrastructure. Depending on the arrangement, this
    may mean that it owns its own data centers or leases them from a third party.
    Regardless, the organization remains in complete control of the operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This has several advantages. One is that the private cloud can be customized.
    An example is that an organization can use it for specialized operations, say
    for an automated warehouse that needs to have low latency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A private cloud is often the option for regulated industries, such as in healthcare
    and financial services. They need high levels of security, compliance, and privacy.
    A security breach could result in expensive lawsuits and damage to a company’s
    brand. In light of this, the private cloud is often the best approach.
  prefs: []

    for sharing of data and applications among the two platforms. This may also include
    multicloud environments. This is where an organization uses more than one public
    cloud system, which can allow for more redundancy. Yet there is still an on-premises
    environment.

    This includes setting up APIs for model inference, managing security groups, and
    handling load balancing. Ongoing maintenance tasks, such as applying security

    growing ecommerce startup. The CEO wants to build a real-time analytics and recommendation
    system to improve the customer experience and drive sales. The system will need
    to ingest and process large volumes of data from various sources, analyze user
    behavior, and provide personalized product recommendations.

- en: To begin the analytics pipeline, the system collects data from both real-time
    and batch sources to provide a comprehensive view of user activity and business
    context. Real-time data—such as clicks, page views, and purchase events—is streamed
    from the company’s website and mobile app using Amazon Kinesis, which enables
    high-throughput, low-latency data ingestion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In parallel, batch data—such as product catalog updates, inventory levels, and
    customer demographic information—is uploaded to Amazon S3, which serves as the
    central storage for the system. Amazon S3 organizes data into buckets and supports
    metadata tagging, making it easier to manage, query, and classify information.
    With 99.999999999% durability, Amazon S3 ensures that data is reliably stored
    across multiple devices and facilities within an AWS region. The service offers
    virtually unlimited scalability and a wide range of storage classes. This allows
    a company to optimize cost and performance based on data usage patterns. For example,
    frequently accessed files can reside in Amazon S3 Standard, while less commonly
    used data may be placed in Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering or Glacier for cost efficiency.
    Amazon S3 also provides fine-grained security through bucket policies, access
    control lists, and encryption.

    step that ensures the information is clean, consistent, and ready to power analytics
    and personalization. For real-time streaming data ingested through Kinesis, Lambda
    is used to automatically trigger functions that perform tasks such as data cleaning,
    transformation, and enrichment. Lambda is a serverless compute service. This means
    AWS handles the infrastructure, scaling, and availability behind the scenes. Developers
    simply upload their code—in languages like Python, Node.js, Java, or Go—and Lambda
    runs it in response to events. It scales automatically based on traffic, and users
    are only charged for the number of requests and the compute time used. Lambda’s
    flexible architecture, combined with its generous free tier, makes it an efficient
    and cost-effective way to process large volumes of real-time data on the fly.

    a fully managed serverless extract, transform, load (ETL) service designed for
    preparing data for analytics and machine learning workloads. AWS Glue integrates
    with over 100 data sources and offers a centralized environment where users can
    create, run, and monitor ETL pipelines using both code and visual interfaces.
    It automates much of the heavy lifting associated with data prep—such as schema
    inference, job scheduling, and dependency resolution—and supports loading curated
    data into services like Amazon Redshift for downstream analysis. Recent advancements
    in AWS Glue include generative AI-assisted development features that help automate
    and streamline complex transformation logic.

    For real-time, low-latency access, DynamoDB is used to store processed user activity
    data. DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless database that excels at handling
    unstructured or semistructured data with millisecond-level response times. It’s
    ideal for use cases like real-time personalization, fraud detection, and social
    engagement.
  prefs: []

    or customer profiles that require relational integrity—the system uses Amazon
    RDS. Amazon RDS supports popular database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL,
    Oracle, and SQL Server, and automates time-consuming administrative tasks such
    as backups, patching, and replication. It provides a familiar SQL interface, enforces
    data integrity through primary and foreign key constraints, and supports deployments
    across multiple AZs for high availability.

    distribute static and dynamic web content. CloudFront accelerates the delivery
    of assets such as product images, promotional banners, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
    files by caching them at a global network of edge locations. When a user accesses
    content, CloudFront serves it from the nearest edge location. This significantly
    reduces latency and improves page load times, which are essential for high-traffic
    ecommerce applications where performance directly impacts user engagement and
    conversion rates.
