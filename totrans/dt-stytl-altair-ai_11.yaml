- en: The data, information, knowledge, wisdom (DIKW) pyramid and the use of generative
    AI have helped you to build a data story tailored to the audience. First, you
    have turned data into information by extracting interesting insights using different
    techniques, such as connections, coincidences, curiosity, and contradictions.
    You have built a basic chart representing the extracted insight using Altair and
    GitHub Copilot. Next, you have turned information into knowledge by adding context
    to your chart, which can be textual or visual. You have used ChatGPT to generate
    the textual context and DALL-E for the visual context. Finally, you have turned
    knowledge into wisdom, adding the next steps to your story. You have learned that
    there are different types of next steps, including awareness and campaigns, collaborative
    efforts, advocacy and policy, training and development, strategic actions, and
    engagement and communications. Each of them depends on the specific objective
    you want to achieve.

    using Streamlit, Tableau, Power BI, and Comet. You will use Streamlit as a standalone
    framework for building web applications. You will also learn how to integrate
    your data story into two popular tools for data storytelling: Tableau and Power
    BI. Finally, you’ll use Comet, an experimentation platform for machine learning
    that also offers a system for report building. Finally, you’ll see how to split
    a single-chart data story into multiple slides for a live presentation.'
