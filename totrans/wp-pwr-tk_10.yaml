    so that search engines such as Google or Bing would list your site up high in
    the results when people search for your site’s topic. This no longer works.
  prefs: []

- en: The goal was to get a link to your site listed at least on the first page of
    the list of links Google displayed. Few people looked at the links on the second
    page. This *was* what SEO meant in the past. AI is seriously disrupting SEO. Things
    are very different now. SEO is being replaced with AI optimization (AIO).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google just displayed a list of links that you could visit to get the information
    you were after. Now, AI skips the links and just gives you the info. Some AIs,
    such as Gemini and Perplexity, include a list of links as citations. And you can
    request citations from any of the AI systems. But links are optional.

    provides you with the answer to your query. And if needed, you can chat with AI,
    asking for a different or more precise response.

    for answers yourself. Now it’s as if you had a researcher at your disposal and
    asked them to look around the internet, solve a problem, and then bring you the
    results.

    your efforts from SEO to AIO. In this chapter, you’ll see how to do just that.

    Google and other earlier search systems used. AI critiques are more sophisticated

    developer use to make your site impressive to GPT and the others? Let’s pause
    for a minute and consider the effect AI will have on many creative activities,
    including optimizing websites. AI didn’t write this book. I did. But I believe
    this will be my last book. Artists, photographers, and illustrators face powerful,
    actually unbeatable, competition from Midjourney and other text-to-image generators.
    So, too, do we writers face obsolescence now that AI is capable of generating
    brilliant articles in seconds and even entire books in minutes.

    traditional SEO. The key focus areas that are more AI-specific relate to optimizing
    knowledge structure and using emerging standards to provide descriptive, machine-readable
    signals throughout content:    •   Use descriptive headers and subheaders. AI
    systems scan content to understand structure, and clear headings help inform that
    process.    •   Summarize key points at the start and end of articles. Chatbots
    often provide summaries to users, so ensuring critical info is in introductions
    and conclusions is important.    •   Employ knowledge graphs where applicable.
    Marking up relationships between entities, topics, events etc. in a structured
    way facilitates AI analysis.    •   Enable rich results across platforms. Optimize
    content so chat platforms can display expanded previews with images, descriptions
    etc. rather than just generic links.    •   Curate authoritative external links.
    Links to credible external sources demonstrate you understand a topic area well
    and are integrating broader knowledge.    •   Publish FAQs and Q&As. Training
    AI systems may leverage question-based datasets, so providing lots of genuine
    examples helps teach relevance.    •   Use alt text and captions thoroughly. Descriptions
    on images, graphics, video and audio allow AI systems to better index and recommend
    multimedia.    •   Emphasize credentials and qualifications. Details on authors,
    founders, team, certifications, research etc. can signal authority on complex
    topics to discerning AI.    •   Include a fair and balanced range of viewpoints.
    Discussing multiple credible perspectives demonstrates thoughtful consideration
    of issues, aiding AI systems’ high-level assessments.    •   Integrate high-quality
    images, graphics and videos. Visual content allows AI to extract deeper meaning,
    make connections and better critique multimodal arguments.    •   Make logical
    reasoning easy to follow. Use clear numerical reasoning, data visualizations,
    structured arguments and quality rhetoric to enable AI critique of reasoning process.   
    •   Cite recent, peer-reviewed research. Cutting-edge, academically published
    science and data helps AI determine if analysis reflects state of the art in a
    field.    •   Proofread thoroughly. Grammar, spelling and formatting errors may
    undermine AI confidence in overall quality and expertise demonstrated.    •  
    Use clear, readable fonts and sufficient contrast between text and background
    colors. Avoid excessive text styling. This aids text analysis and extraction.
    Sans serif fonts like Arial, Helvetica or Verdana tend to score well.    •   Use
    color, size and style variations judiciously to highlight titles, headings and
    calls-to-action. But keep body text clear of excess ornamentation.    •   The
    same clarity and consistency that enhances reading comprehension and user experience
    for humans also benefits AI content analysis system.    •   Ensure images are
    clear, relevant, and enrich content. Images should enhance understanding for both
    users and AI.    •   Choose accessible color palettes with sufficient contrast,
    avoiding combinations that could trigger visual conditions. Neutrals with bright
    accent colors tend to be safe and appealing options.    •   Use white space, size/styling
    variation and positioning to create a visual hierarchy and guide users to key
    content and calls-to-action. This enhances scanability for humans and AI.Optimizing
    for AI’s advanced reasoning capabilities means demonstrating deep topic expertise,
    critical thinking, and skill in synthesizing complex ideas. |'

    that enables the representation of relationships and connections between entities
    (such as objects, events, situations, or concepts). It’s essentially a graphical
    representation of a knowledge base, where nodes represent entities and edges represent
    the relationships between them. This structure allows for a flexible and intuitive
    way of organizing and querying data, making it particularly useful for semantic
    searches, data integration, and advanced analytics.Knowledge graphs are widely
    used in various applications, including search engines (like Google’s Knowledge
    Graph), recommendation systems, social networks, and artificial intelligence systems.
    They help these systems understand the context and relationships between different
    pieces of information, enabling more accurate and relevant responses to user queries.The
    key components of a knowledge graph include:    •   Entities: The primary objects,
    concepts, or instances that the graph describes, such as people, places, items,
    or ideas.    •   Relationships: The connections or associations between entities,
    which can be labeled to describe the nature of the connection, such as “is a part
    of,” “created by,” or “located in.”    •   Attributes: Information that describes
    or characterizes entities, providing more detail about them.The example image
    shows Person has a relationship HAS_A with Pet.Person has a relationship WORKS_AT
    with Company.Company is LOCATED_IN a City.Pet is an Animal Type, which BELONGS_TO

    of AI and data analysis, but they serve different purposes and are not the same
    thing.Imagine you have a bunch of Lego blocks. Each block represents a piece of
    information.Data Visualization:Data visualization is like creating a picture or
    a map out of these Lego blocks. You arrange the blocks in such a way that when
    you step back, you can easily see a pattern or a shape. This could be anything
    from a simple bar chart (like stacking blocks to see which pile is tallest) to
    a complex map showing different data points. The main idea is to help you see
    the big picture quickly, like how many students prefer pizza over burgers, by
    just looking at the arrangement of the blocks.Knowledge Graphs:Now, imagine instead
    of just stacking these blocks, you start connecting them with strings based on
    how they relate to each other. For example, you connect a block representing “you”
    to another block that represents “your pet dog” with a string labeled “owns.”
    You might also connect your block to a “school” block with a string labeled “attends.”
    This network of blocks and strings is like a knowledge graph. It shows not just
    the blocks (or pieces of information) but also how each block is related to the
    others through the strings (relationships).The Difference:Data Visualization is
    all about making complex data easy to understand at a glance. It’s like looking
    at a picture made out of Lego blocks to quickly get what’s going on.Knowledge
    Graphs are about showing the relationships between different pieces of information.
    It’s like seeing how all your Lego blocks are connected with strings, telling
    a story about how everything is related.So, while both help us understand information,
    data visualization is about seeing the big picture quickly, and knowledge graphs
    are about understanding the relationships and connections between different pieces
