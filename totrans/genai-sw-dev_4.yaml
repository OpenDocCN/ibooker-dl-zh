- en: Testing and quality assurance (QA) are usually the last gates that new software
    code must pass through before it gets deployed in production. Their ultimate goal
    is to find costly bugs or other standout issues that may have made it through
    code review (as covered in the previous chapter) to avoid putting them into production.

  zh: 测试和质量保证（QA）通常是新软件代码在部署到生产之前必须通过的最后一道关卡。它们的最终目标是找到成本高昂的bug或其他突出的问题，这些问题可能已经通过了代码审查（如前一章所述），以避免将它们投入生产。
- en: The QA process happens after code has been developed, reviewed, and accepted
    to merge into the codebase. There is occasional confusion between testing and
    QA as concepts, perhaps because the stakeholders traditionally involved are called
    either testing engineers or QA engineers at different companies. Whatever the
    title, though, they are usually in charge of the process covered in this chapter.

  zh: QA过程发生在代码开发、审查和接受合并到代码库之后。在测试和QA作为概念之间偶尔会有混淆，这可能是因为在不同公司中，传统上涉及的利益相关者被称为测试工程师或QA工程师。无论头衔如何，他们通常负责本章中涵盖的过程。
- en: Typically, the QA process consists of conducting manual and/or automated tests
    in an environment that closely matches production and mimics user behavior, to
    catch any bugs that escaped the code-review process.

  zh: 通常，质量保证（QA）过程包括在一个与生产环境紧密匹配且模拟用户行为的测试环境中执行手动和/或自动化测试，以捕捉任何在代码审查过程中遗漏的bug。
- en: When such bugs are found during testing/QA, the feature is regressed back to
    development status. The original software engineer in charge of implementation
    must fix the issues before pushing the feature to review and QA again. These regression
    loops aim to guarantee that the code that ultimately gets deployed to production
    is indeed bug-free.

  zh: 自动化测试
- en: Automated testing employs specialized software tools to execute pre-scripted
    tests on the application. This method is highly efficient for repetitive and regression
    tests, because it reduces the time needed to validate new code changes. Automation
    ensures consistency and precision, minimizes the risk of human error, and enables
    extensive test coverage. Automated tests can run around the clock, providing rapid
    feedback and allowing for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
    pipelines. Although initially setting up automated tests requires effort, as does
    maintaining them, the long-term benefits include faster release cycles, improved
    accuracy, and the ability to quickly detect and address defects.

  zh: 自动化测试使用专门的软件工具来执行预编写的测试用例。这种方法对于重复性和回归测试非常高效，因为它减少了验证新代码更改所需的时间。自动化确保了一致性和精确性，最小化了人为错误的风险，并实现了广泛的测试覆盖。自动化测试可以全天候运行，提供快速反馈，并允许持续集成和持续交付（CI/CD）管道。尽管最初设置自动化测试和维护它们都需要努力，但长期的好处包括更快的发布周期、更高的准确性和快速检测和解决缺陷的能力。

  zh: 手动测试
- en: In manual testing, human testers meticulously execute test cases without the
    assistance of automated tools. They simulate end-user behavior to identify defects,
    ensuring that the software behaves as expected in real-world scenarios. This approach
    allows for nuanced understanding and adaptability, often catching issues that
    automated scripts might miss, such as user-interface glitches and usability concerns.
    While manual testing can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, it remains essential
    for exploratory testing, where creativity and intuition are crucial in uncovering
    unexpected bugs and ensuring a seamless user experience.

  zh: 在手动测试中，测试人员细致地执行测试用例，而不依赖自动化工具。他们模拟最终用户的行为来识别缺陷，确保软件在现实世界场景中的行为符合预期。这种方法允许对细节有深入的理解和适应性，通常能够捕捉到自动化脚本可能遗漏的问题，例如用户界面问题和可用性问题。虽然手动测试可能耗时且劳动密集，但它对于探索性测试仍然是必不可少的，在探索性测试中，创造力和直觉对于发现意外的bug和确保无缝的用户体验至关重要。

    and functionality in your software application. Visual testing has also been simplified
    with AI-powered tools that automatically detect visual bugs, ensuring that your
    user interface looks and works as intended. These improvements make the testing
    process more effective and efficient, which allows testers to focus on improving

    aspects of the CI/CD process. Thanks to CI/CD-integrated testing tools, we now

    makes it easy to automate complex workflows. This, in turn, makes testing accessible

- en: I’ve often been part of conversations about budget planning and roadmap discussions
    where robust testing was postponed, or outdated tests were simply framed as technical
    debt that should be phased out. It’s very common for both technical and nontechnical
    stakeholders to have biases against proper testing practices, and one of the key
    reasons for that is how significant an investment it has been, historically, to
    have them.

  zh: 我经常参与关于预算规划和路线图讨论的对话，在这些对话中，稳健的测试被推迟，或者过时的测试被简单地视为应该逐步淘汰的技术债务。对于技术和非技术利益相关者来说，对适当的测试实践存在偏见是非常常见的，其中一个关键原因就是，在历史上，要实现这些测试需要巨大的投资。

    the table. In software development, we’re constantly looking for occurrences of
    the Pareto principle: “What’s the 20% of effort that will return 80% of this roadmap
    item’s value?” As a CTO, I’ve been in the center of these discussions many times.
    In QA, the 20% of effort that creates 80% of value involves defining the application
    workflow properly; talking with users and clients about the issues and edge cases;
    going the extra mile to map out nuances for the software developers who will implement
    the requirements; and, ultimately, conducting user acceptance testing as a final
    gatekeeper before going live.'

  zh: 这就引出了AI测试工具可以带来的大部分价值。在软件开发中，我们一直在寻找帕累托原则的体现：“投入20%的努力就能带来80%的路线图项目价值的是什么？”作为一个CTO，我多次参与这些讨论。在质量保证（QA）中，创造80%价值的20%的努力包括正确定义应用程序工作流程；与用户和客户讨论问题和边缘情况；为将实施要求的开发人员提供额外的细节，以映射出细微差别；最终，在上线前作为最后的把关人进行用户验收测试。
- en: The other 80% of effort, which creates 20% of value, is the actual grunt work
    of writing and executing each test to verify if the code fulfills the requirements.
    AI tools excel at this task. Being able to provide instructions in natural language
    and get back tests written in proper syntax, ready to execute, is a huge time-saving
    use case. Having those self-healing capabilities to update tests whenever application
    code is changed is a great backstop for when tests become deprecated and are simply
    commented out, as pressing priorities emerge to get a release to production.

  zh: 另外的80%的努力，只创造了20%的价值，是实际编写和执行每个测试以验证代码是否满足要求的工作。AI工具在这方面表现出色。能够用自然语言提供指令，并得到语法正确、准备就绪、可以执行的测试，这是一个节省大量时间的用例。当测试变得过时并被简单地注释掉时，这些自我修复能力可以在应用程序代码更改时更新测试，这是一个很好的后备措施，因为迫切需要将发布版本投入生产。
- en: 'These are the day-to-day decisions that so often relegate proper software testing
    to a second-order priority. AI tools can help alleviate those concerns and contribute
    to ensuring that software running in production is properly tested and bug-free.
    This can’t be done by AI tools *alone*, since these tools won’t replace humans.
    Quite the opposite: the human tasks in QA are critical, as they define the scope
    of testing and serve as key guidelines for the AI tools to do the grunt work at
    a high quality standard.'

  zh: 这些是日常决策，它们往往将适当的软件测试降级为第二优先级。AI工具可以帮助缓解这些担忧，并有助于确保在生产中运行的软件得到适当的测试且无错误。这不能仅靠AI工具来完成，因为这些工具不会取代人类。恰恰相反：在质量保证（QA）中的人类任务是至关重要的，因为它们定义了测试范围，并为AI工具以高标准完成繁琐工作提供了关键指南。
