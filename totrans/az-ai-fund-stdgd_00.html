<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Over the years, I’ve immersed myself in artificial intelligence (AI). I’ve written several books on the topic and advised companies on leveraging its transformative potential. In that time, one question has emerged as a recurring theme when I talk to people: how can I enhance my AI skills?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I typically share a range of options. There’s no shortage of excellent books, online courses, and YouTube tutorials to get you started. But if you’re looking for a structured path, I recommend pursuing a certification. Certifications do more than test your knowledge—they validate your expertise. For employers, they’re a signal that you not only understand the fundamentals but also are prepared to apply them in the real world.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Among the myriad AI certifications available, one stands out: the Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900) exam. It doesn’t just skim the surface. It dives into key AI domains like machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, generative AI, and responsible AI. Of course, there is coverage of key solutions from Microsoft Azure.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>So whether you’re charting a new career path or bolstering your current role, the AI-900 certification equips you with a solid foundation. And this book is your ally in that journey. Packed with the resources you need to pass the exam, it’s also a handy reference guide for broader AI topics.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>So here’s my advice: dive in, stay curious, and don’t be afraid to challenge yourself. AI offers limitless opportunities, and with the right tools and mindset, you’re poised to make an impact.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Thank you for picking up this book—and best of luck as you embark on your AI adventure.</p>&#13;
