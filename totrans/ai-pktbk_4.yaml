    AI, thus replacing the job of screenwriters. After speaking with screenwriters,
    I’ve discovered that the job is often much more complicated than it may seem at
    first, or at least if you want to do it really well. Screenwriting is not so much

    to say it, and some screenwriters go to great lengths to perform this task.

    touch, such as networking, gathering human feedback, building relationships, and

    these activities by asking someone whether their job can be easily described as
    a list of steps or a recipe, which can shed light on how easy it is to automate
    with AI or some other technique. For example, I asked that to a journalist, and
    she told me that she spent a lot of time trying to come up with creative story
    angles, and she didn’t think there was a recipe for that. Moreover, a lot of her
    work involved building good relationships with influential people in her area,
    so she could reach out to them for commentary when necessary, and she didn’t think
    there was a step-by-step recipe that described how to do that, either.

    several articles quickly about a travel destination to attract traffic and then

    articles tend to be the “just fine” kind, as the goal is to pack them with relevant

    profession. Translators often go to great lengths to produce an excellent translation,
    which can require a lot of research and creativity. In some cases, however, clients
    don’t care much about that excellence—they’re okay with a “just fine” translation.
    For example, I spoke with a group of translators who specialize in translating
    the content of websites, such as online shops. They seemed to be the ones struggling
    the most due to AI advancements, as many clients didn’t mind AI translations even
    if they were a bit flimsy. In other cases, such as literary translation, clients

    We built an algorithm that looked good on paper, but we couldn’t deploy it because
    salespeople had concerns about it. They were scared that, by changing how we put
    the packages together, we would disrupt our relationship with customers. Moreover,
    salespeople often priced holidays strategically—for example, instead of trying

    which has become extremely popular. In TDD, you divide your code into small units
    and spend time to think of edge cases or things that could go wrong with each
    unit. You then write individual tests for all these things that could go wrong,
    and you make sure that your code passes the tests (some people even write the
    tests before writing the code). I often advise others to write a test case instead
    every time they’re tempted to run the software to see if it works well, perhaps
    using a “print” statement. This way, the test stays in the code base forever and
    can be helpful in catching problems later. But you don’t want to overdo it. Part
    of your responsibility as a test-driven developer is to find the sweet spot between
    coding and testing—you shouldn’t spend too much time writing outlandish tests
    to cover scenarios that are extremely unlikely to happen.

    code. Coding and validation were thus quite separate activities.

    branch without peer review (some may use short-lived feature branches). For this
    to work, you must adopt a set of work practices to prevent breaking the production
    app. For example, you may use a mechanism known as a *feature flag* to direct
    most users to the old version of the code and only a handful of users, such as
    yourself and the quality assurance team, to the new version. You only remove the
    old code and point every user to the new one once you validate that your new feature
    works as expected. Moreover, the deployment pipeline must contain plenty of automated
    tests. You can learn more about this process on [trunkbaseddevelopment.com](http://trunkbaseddevelopment.com).

    impose additional requirements in terms of validation, as AI sometimes hallucinates
    or produces different outputs on different executions. How can you properly measure
    the accuracy of an AI-based product in performing a task? And how can you find
    opportunities to improve it?

    their AI-based products because they were disappointed with AI’s performance.
    This included both developers and entrepreneurs. In addition to the odd hallucination,
    they often complained that AI lacked consistency. For example, a company created
    an AI model to generate recommendations to improve marketing videos. The users
    would implement one of the recommendations and then run the video again through
    the app, but now the app would make completely different recommendations and forget
    some of the previous ones. This was frustrating to users.

    process to validate and select AI models. For example, they didn’t have a benchmark
    to assess the performance of different models at the task or how performance improved
    as the prompt changed. Moreover, they summarized the entire task in one single
    mega-prompt and hoped for the best. I encouraged them to divide the problem into
    smaller units and conduct thorough benchmarking. This would help diagnose the
    problem and identify individual subtasks that could be improved, perhaps bringing
    in some external data or even not using AI at all. In addition, benchmarking could
    help build realistic assumptions about performance and see how close you are to
    what’s acceptable—AI will rarely work just the way you want 100% of the time.
    In chapter 3, we discussed the preferred process for validation and selection
    of models, which gives you an idea of how AI could perform in the future and avoid
    unfortunate biases that can arise from poor handling of the validation process.

    Instead of big, try tiny, huge, gigantic, enormous, or immense. . . . Plural words

    idea with potential users. These clients often don’t care about the scalability
    or future-proofing of the solution. They want you to build something quickly so
    they can show it to users and gather feedback. If they collect evidence that there’s
    a real need for the product, they often throw away the initial prototype and hire
    engineers to build a more serious product afterward. Many of these entrepreneurs
    are now using no-code app builders such as Bubble or FlutterFlow, without hiring
    engineers, to build the apps themselves. We could imagine they’ll increasingly
    rely on AI tools and become less inclined to hire engineers for their early-stage

    adjusted for inflation, or real GDP). Countries with a higher per-capita GDP produce
    more stuff for their inhabitants. This often means they enjoy a higher standard
    of living. The GDP of a country grows when it finds ways to produce more stuff,
    for example, by using more advanced production techniques or by building machines
    that automate away part of the manual work.

    and they become cheaper.

    can be used to innovate and produce nonessential things, such as entertainment

    found in job titles that did not exist in 1940” ([https://mng.bz/N1rd](https://mng.bz/N1rd)).
    So, while automation eliminates jobs, ultimately the economy accommodates the
    freed-up resources to the production of other stuff, perhaps things that weren’t
    produced before and that aren’t as essential to survive. Automation, provided
    that it uses resources efficiently, makes an economy richer, not poorer.
