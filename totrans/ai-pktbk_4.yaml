    AI, thus replacing the job of screenwriters. After speaking with screenwriters,
    I’ve discovered that the job is often much more complicated than it may seem at
    first, or at least if you want to do it really well. Screenwriting is not so much
    about putting words together. Instead, it’s about choosing what to say and how
    to say it, and some screenwriters go to great lengths to perform this task.

    He told me that perhaps repetitive, formulaic writing might be affected, the kind
    you find in soap operas. However, in higher-profile productions, most of the work
    isn’t about writing itself but about conducting interviews, doing research, trying
    out ideas with a test audience, and so on—tasks that the likes of ChatGPT are
    unlikely to do.

    touch, such as networking, gathering human feedback, building relationships, and
    so on, for which current AI methods aren’t very suitable. You can sometimes detect
    these activities by asking someone whether their job can be easily described as
    a list of steps or a recipe, which can shed light on how easy it is to automate
    with AI or some other technique. For example, I asked that to a journalist, and
    she told me that she spent a lot of time trying to come up with creative story
    angles, and she didn’t think there was a recipe for that. Moreover, a lot of her
    work involved building good relationships with influential people in her area,
    so she could reach out to them for commentary when necessary, and she didn’t think
    there was a step-by-step recipe that described how to do that, either.

    of the excellence gap, such as writing higher-end TV shows. Jobs that might suffer
    from AI are the ones in which the worker specializes on the low end of the gap—the
    “just fine” part—or there isn’t much of a gap to start with—there isn’t a wide
    difference between doing it just fine and exceedingly well, the tasks being quite
    mechanic and easily described as a list of steps.

    traffic to a website from Google. For example, a travel agency may want to publish
    several articles quickly about a travel destination to attract traffic and then
    sell holidays to internauts or collect commissions from affiliate links. These
    articles tend to be the “just fine” kind, as the goal is to pack them with relevant
    keywords, not to provide insightful analyses. I’m sure you’ve seen articles like
    that. They often have titles such as “20 Things to Do in Paris This Summer (2025).”

    doesn’t have much market value—people are not willing to pay for excellent work
    because just fine is good enough. I’ve spoken with many professional translators
    over the past few months, who reached out to me due to concerns regarding their
    profession. Translators often go to great lengths to produce an excellent translation,
    which can require a lot of research and creativity. In some cases, however, clients
    don’t care much about that excellence—they’re okay with a “just fine” translation.
    For example, I spoke with a group of translators who specialize in translating
    the content of websites, such as online shops. They seemed to be the ones struggling
    the most due to AI advancements, as many clients didn’t mind AI translations even
    if they were a bit flimsy. In other cases, such as literary translation, clients
    are much more sensitive about the quality of the work and are less likely to be
    ready to replace professional, human translators with AI.

    so that a company could visualize some publicly available data more easily. I
    had to make a few API calls to fetch the data from various sources, transform

    mechanical, and doing it just fine was okay.

    for a team that wrote algorithms to put together holiday packages automatically,
    including determining their prices. The algorithm was meant to design packages
    automatically and make the process more data driven, hopefully increasing revenue.
    We built an algorithm that looked good on paper, but we couldn’t deploy it because
    salespeople had concerns about it. They were scared that, by changing how we put
    the packages together, we would disrupt our relationship with customers. Moreover,
    salespeople often priced holidays strategically—for example, instead of trying
    to make the most revenue, they charged lower-than-revenue-maximizing prices to
    promote a new travel destination. They were afraid our system would make them
    lose control over those decisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To reduce friction, we had a discussion with the salespeople to understand their
    needs, and as a result, we came up with a mathematical gimmick to insert business
    constraints to our algorithm. Salespeople would be able to adjust these constraints
    themselves, which would give them much finer control over the holiday packages
    generated by our tool. Only after this intervention they were happy with it, and
    we could deploy the system. The success of the project was not just about coding,
    but about understanding what salespeople wanted and finding a solution that clicked
    with them.

    projects. In some cases, like the simple dashboard project I mentioned, just fine
    is okay. The tasks involved in doing these jobs can often be written down as a
    step-by-step recipe and delegated cheaply. This is the kind of work that AI might
    be able to replace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Excellent software engineering is much more than that. Rather than just writing
    code as asked, the goal is to help a business solve a problem, as in the case
    of the package holiday example. The software engineer will work closely with the
    business to help devise solutions to problems. For example, they will help businesspeople
    identify features that provide the most added value for the least effort. They
    will also suggest alternative solutions that the business may have not thought
    of.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, excellent software developers help build robust solutions that stand
    the test of time. This requires finding the sweet spot between future-proofing
    and overengineering. For example, should your software handle multiple currencies
    even if all your users (for now) transact in the same currency? Or should you
    wait until you expand internationally to add support for other currencies? These
    are questions you can only answer by discussing and negotiating with the business,
    which often requires translating technical ideas to a language nontechnical people
    can understand so you can collaborate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, in excellent software development, you must make important decisions
    to secure the software and protect data. I once worked with a company that was
    particularly sensitive about accidentally letting one of their clients see data
    that belonged to another client. Having one isolated database per client is a
    way to accomplish that, but it can be overkill in some cases. After discussing
    different possibilities with the business, we settled for having a single database
    with different compartments in it, or *schemas,* which provided isolation without
    so much added complexity. This decision required negotiating with businesspeople.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As excellent software engineering is not just about writing code but about doing
    business and exercising soft skills, I think it will be well placed to resist
    replacement by AI. When businesspeople work alongside software engineers who genuinely
    help them solve business problems, they’re unlikely to want to automate them away.

    you may have noticed that hotel reviews from travelers are often translated into
    your language. This helps you see as many reviews as possible. Instead of hiring
    humans to translate the reviews, these companies use AI to do so automatically.
    The outputs generated by AI aren’t verified manually one by one. Sometimes AI
    hallucinates, so the translations have mistakes or sound a little funny. I just
    saw the following review on [Booking.com:](http://Booking.com:) “Location perfect.
    Report value for money, nothing to say.” The strange use of the word “report”
    came from the mistranslation of *rapport qualité prix* in French, which is a common
    way of saying “good value for money.”

    hallucinate, is just fine.

    which movie to watch next on Netflix or which product to buy on Amazon. Instead
    of having a marketing specialist analyze customers and create tailor-made recommendations,
    these are generated at scale and automatically using machine learning trained
    on past user data. Sometimes these recommendations aren’t quite right. For example,
    you may be recommended to buy another washing machine after you just bought one,
    even though washing machines are usually a one-off purchase. But these mistakes

    have” features that aren’t critical to a company’s core operations, so mistakes
    don’t matter much. It is also common with large-scale tasks that would be too
    time-consuming or costly to perform. For example, I think it’s unlikely [Booking.com](http://Booking.com)

    example, perhaps AI might help draft legal contracts quickly, which lawyers will
    have to verify word by word (remember the unfortunate story of the lawyer who
    filed a document in court rife with AI hallucinations), but this two-step process
    will be quicker than writing the contract without AI.

    This requires many more duties than just writing code. For example, you may spend
    a large and perhaps greater portion of your work making sure that your code is
    robust to edge cases and unfortunate situations. Even if AI can write some code
    for you, that is only a small portion of your duties. Your employer will see you
    as a person who delivers holistic and robust code that stands the test of time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    driven; they intertwine development and testing and try to deliver robust software
    off the bat. These teams make validation central and tightly coupled to the development
    process, as opposed to a secondary task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also recommend that you learn about *test-driven development,* or *TDD**,*
    which has become extremely popular. In TDD, you divide your code into small units
    and spend time to think of edge cases or things that could go wrong with each
    unit. You then write individual tests for all these things that could go wrong,
    and you make sure that your code passes the tests (some people even write the
    tests before writing the code). I often advise others to write a test case instead
    every time they’re tempted to run the software to see if it works well, perhaps
    using a “print” statement. This way, the test stays in the code base forever and
    can be helpful in catching problems later. But you don’t want to overdo it. Part
    of your responsibility as a test-driven developer is to find the sweet spot between
    coding and testing—you shouldn’t spend too much time writing outlandish tests
    to cover scenarios that are extremely unlikely to happen.

- en: I also recommend you learn about *trunk-based development,* which is an increasingly
    popular way of organizing software teams. Before trunk-based development, each
    coder worked on a separate branch of the main code branch. After finishing, peers
    reviewed the software (in a “pull request”) before it was merged into the main
    code. Coding and validation were thus quite separate activities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In trunk-based development, coders directly push their updates to the main code
    branch without peer review (some may use short-lived feature branches). For this
    to work, you must adopt a set of work practices to prevent breaking the production
    app. For example, you may use a mechanism known as a *feature flag* to direct
    most users to the old version of the code and only a handful of users, such as
    yourself and the quality assurance team, to the new version. You only remove the
    old code and point every user to the new one once you validate that your new feature
    works as expected. Moreover, the deployment pipeline must contain plenty of automated
    tests. You can learn more about this process on [trunkbaseddevelopment.com](http://trunkbaseddevelopment.com).

    an AI model to generate recommendations to improve marketing videos. The users

    the app, but now the app would make completely different recommendations and forget
    some of the previous ones. This was frustrating to users.

    process to validate and select AI models. For example, they didn’t have a benchmark
    to assess the performance of different models at the task or how performance improved
    as the prompt changed. Moreover, they summarized the entire task in one single
    mega-prompt and hoped for the best. I encouraged them to divide the problem into
    smaller units and conduct thorough benchmarking. This would help diagnose the
    problem and identify individual subtasks that could be improved, perhaps bringing
    in some external data or even not using AI at all. In addition, benchmarking could
    help build realistic assumptions about performance and see how close you are to
    what’s acceptable—AI will rarely work just the way you want 100% of the time.

    of living. The GDP of a country grows when it finds ways to produce more stuff,
    for example, by using more advanced production techniques or by building machines
    that automate away part of the manual work.

    to produce essential items like food and clothes. When it accumulates machines,
    fewer hours are required to produce the same stuff, so more items can be produced,
    and they become cheaper.

    can be used to innovate and produce nonessential things, such as entertainment
    and TV series. A 2022 study revealed that “roughly 60% of employment in 2018 is
    found in job titles that did not exist in 1940” ([https://mng.bz/N1rd](https://mng.bz/N1rd)).
    So, while automation eliminates jobs, ultimately the economy accommodates the
    freed-up resources to the production of other stuff, perhaps things that weren’t
    produced before and that aren’t as essential to survive. Automation, provided
    that it uses resources efficiently, makes an economy richer, not poorer.

    cause of constantly mounting unemployment and misery, the logical conclusions
    to be drawn would be revolutionary, not only in the technical field but for our
    whole concept of civilization. Not only should we have to regard all further technical
    progress as a calamity; we should have to regard all past technical progress with
    equal horror. . . . Why should freight be carried from New York to Chicago by
    railroads when we could employ enormously more men, for example, to carry it all
    on their backs? . . . What machines do, to repeat, is to bring an increase in
    production and an increase in the standard of living.

    by the new machine. . . . Now he has become overnight an unskilled workman again,
    and can hope, for the present, only for the wages of an unskilled workman, because
    the one skill he had is no longer needed. We cannot and must not forget Joe Smith.
    His is one of the personal tragedies . . . incident to nearly all industrial and
    economic progress.

    us produce stuff more efficiently. As we saw, AI hallucinates and its outputs
    often need to be thoroughly validated. In addition, as we’ll discuss later, it
    consumes quite a lot of electricity and other natural resources. However, it does
    seem to be helping perform certain tasks more efficiently in a variety of industries.
    This will create economic growth, not misery, in the long run, just like so many
    other machines have done in the past. Some people will lose their jobs in the
    process, and this will certainly be harsh for them. But we should not fall prey
    to the idea that new technology causes widespread and prolonged misery. It’s quite
    the opposite.
