    But when IBM hired me, I quickly fell in love with the technology industry. There
    was no turning back. I would go on to work at other companies like VMware, Pivotal,
    EMC, and SGI.

    AI solutions for enterprises. Our platform helps with customer service, employee
    experience, enterprise search, IT service desk, and AIOps.

    things we wanted to do but could not because of the bottlenecks with our engineering
    teams. But with AI-assisted programming, the game has changed in a big way. It
    has made Aisera more agile and nimble. It’s been a force multiplier that has helped
    propel our growth.

    not like typical development. You need to understand how to use generative AI
    systems. This is where Tom’s book comes in. He has written a playbook for any
    developer who wants to become proficient with AI-assisted programming. He’s covered
    the key topics and has provided many useful examples. He also has done this in
    a fun manner, making the topic approachable.
