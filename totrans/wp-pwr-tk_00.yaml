    how to use artificial intelligence (AI) to go far beyond what you could do in
    WordPress on your own. Over the course of the book I’ll show you how to rapidly
    build and polish a fully professional and unique website of your own. One you
    can be quite proud of. The book’s chapters progress from basic to more advanced
    topics. And I’ll explain everything in clear detail with concrete examples and
    step-by-step instructions.

    was designed from the ground up to be easy to use. I teach three online WordPress

    you have to find a developer that you hope is competent. Many developers are more
    skilled at programming than design, so you can easily end up with a smoothly functioning
    site that looks, to put it kindly, less than attractive. Too much media, or too
    little. A crowded, barren, or unbalanced layout. Inappropriate or unreadable typefaces.
    An unsuitable color scheme. You get the idea.

    have to call the developer back for site maintenance. And your site *will* need
    maintenance. That said, if you don’t have the time but do have the money, there
    are great developers out there—and some are quite reasonable.

    change over time, and you want your site to remain contemporary. If you can maintain
    the site yourself, you’ll save both money and time (developers are sometimes busy
    and have to put you in a queue). With AI and WordPress, site maintenance—like
    site building—is far easier than most people realize, as you’ll soon find out.

    Recipes” practice website, but it’s fine if you want to just apply these lessons
    to your own site. You’ll find instructions in the appendix that show you step-by-step
    how to create the practice site, and install the Twenty Sixteen theme it uses.
    Also, this book focuses on the classic WordPress editor, rather than the Gutenberg
    block editor. So for the practice site, you should install the Classic Editor
    plugin (also explained in the appendix). Nonetheless, I’ve included parallel instructions
    throughout the book showing how to use the Gutenberg block editor for those who
    prefer it.

    WordPress, however, has grown to dominate the internet, and now enjoys 65% of
    the market share. The closest runner-up is Joomla, with only 4.6%. Until WordPress
    came along, building a website required you to struggle with the three terrible
    “T’s”—time, technicality, and tedium. Most people simply couldn’t do it! WordPress
    made its debut in 2003, and the result was that constructing websites quickly
    became far simpler and far more efficient. And since 2011, WordPress usage has
    increased, on average, 12% each year.

    and Drupal. For one thing, WordPress eliminates the need to write programming
    code. As a result, pretty much everyone can now build impressive sites for themselves—whether
    the site’s purpose is professional, commercial, educational, personal, or business.
    And as you’ll see, a great site can be built in weeks, not months.

    judging and polishing the writing. Or, you send it back for revision or fact-checking.
    But ultimately, you’re a senior editor with a junior assistant. Or when brainstorming,
    you pick the best of several suggestions. You originate a project, providing *concepts,
    instructions,* and *goals* rather than preparing preliminary sketches, researching,
    or doing first drafts. You oversee apprentices who do the legwork and the prep
    work and bring you samples to pick from. In other words, you don’t originate content.
    You propose, evaluate, and critique it.

    2026 (18 months later than many were predicting). And further, version 5 won’t
    possess artificial general intelligence (AGI). That means it will be specialized.
    It won’t be capable of performing a wide variety of tasks as well as or better
    than the best humans. Currently, narrowly focused AI can beat us at specific tasks

    with variations on “you are a skilled mechanic” or “act as a master cake decorator.”
    AI sometimes demurs, saying that it’s not a lawyer or that, as an AI, it doesn’t
    have personal opinions. But often it follows that reluctance with a good answer
    anyway. (You can also slightly rephrase your prompt to get it to answer, if need
    be.)

    result in “go double nickel here and you’ll get a bumper sticker,” which, when

    These are units of text, but not necessarily words. Tokens don’t map 1:1 to words.
    For example, a punctuation mark is a token. The term *ice cream* is only one token.
    So, if there’s a lot of punctuation, AI responds with fewer words than you requested,
    or if there are several multi-word tokens, you’ll get more words. Claude, when
    asked, defends its refusal to give you a response with the exact word count you
    asked for because “Metrics like coherence, relevance, factual accuracy are prioritized
    instead.” In other words, it prefers to offer quality rather than quantity. Fair
    enough. By the way, how many tokens do you think AI systems are being trained
    on? It’s difficult to get this data, but several sources say that Meta’s largest
    LlaMA model was trained on 1.4 trillion. That benchmark has undoubtedly grown

    and designs that don’t really work together to result in a clear overall purpose

    their plugin for compatibility with the other 59,000\. If you notice some odd
    behaviors (bugs), take a look at your plugins first. Plugin side effects are the
    single most common cause of bugs in WordPress. That said, most plugins, especially
    the very popular ones, play well together.

    to a site. Examples include an events calendar, a contact form, social media integration,
    speeding up page loads, and a spam blocker, among others. Plugins are similar

    installed or removed at will.

    that should be visible on a page but isn’t. Or, you see an error message. Bugs
    can cause crashes, freezes, incorrect display of information, or other unexpected
    behaviors. If you have a bug in WordPress, the first step in debugging is to temporarily
    deactivate all of your plugins (it’s easy to do) and then reactivate them one
    by one. When the bug reappears, the plugin you just reactivated is the culprit.
    Uninstall it, and find an alternative plugin. With tens of thousands of available
    plugins, you won’t have any problem finding a good substitute. Google “best WordPress
    contact form plugins,” or ask an AI. Given the wide choice of quality plugins
    available, there’s little reason to waste time trying to figure out why one of
    yours is causing problems.

    to be abandoned by their creator, play well with others, and are kept up-to-date
    so they don’t introduce security vulnerabilities. One good strategy is to choose
    popular plugins that are marketed in two tiers—a free and a paid version. These
    *freemium* plugins provide an income stream for their developers and are thus
    probably going to be kept current.

    to override that theme default and display your paragraphs in Roboto or Verdana.
    You gain pretty much complete control of all things visual on your site. You can
    even make all the text in the site blue, change the font style on a single page,
    or display a single word in Roboto and leave all the other text in Garamond. In
    other words, you can modify and polish your site in highly specific, granular
    ways. This frees you from any design constraints imposed by the theme.

    accomplish things such as resizing or repositioning a photo on a page. You can
    click in a color palette to change colors, choose a new typeface by selecting
    from a dropdown list, and make many other customizations. In this visual way,
    you can easily modify and improve the appearance of your site without having to
    write a single line of code. YellowPencil knows what CSS code is required to achieve
    the results you’re after.

    site’s topic, or a customer-service feature that answers questions. Many blogs
    don’t permit comments from the audience because it can become time-consuming to
    vet all the incoming messages. But we’ll look at ways to automate the approval
    process. For example, you can make a list of forbidden words (“dumb”, “s***”,
