    to this point, you have joined the small, but growing group of people who are
    able to harness the power of deep learning to solve real problems. You may not
    feel that way—in fact, you probably don’t. We have seen again and again that students
    who complete the fast.ai courses dramatically underestimate their effectiveness
    as deep learning practitioners. We’ve also seen that these people are often underestimated
    by others with a classic academic background. So if you are to rise above your
    own expectations and the expectations of others, what you do next, after closing
    this book, is even more important than what you’ve done to get to this point.

    from your study of optimizers, momentum is something that can build upon itself!
    So think about what you can do now to maintain and accelerate your deep learning
    journey. [Figure 20-1](#do_next) can give you a few ideas.

- en: We’ve talked a lot in this book about the value of writing, whether it be code
    or prose. But perhaps you haven’t quite written as much as you had hoped so far.
    That’s OK! Now is a great chance to turn that around. You have a lot to say at
    this point. Perhaps you have tried some experiments on a dataset that other people
    don’t seem to have looked at in quite the same way. Tell the world about it! Or
    perhaps you are thinking about trying out some ideas that occurred to you while
    you were reading—now is a great time to turn those ideas into code.

    [fast.ai forums](https://forums.fast.ai). You will find that the community there
    is very supportive and helpful, so please do drop by and let us know what you’ve
    been up to. Or see if you can answer a few questions for those folks who are earlier
    in their journey than you.

    be sure to let us know! Posting about them on the forums is especially helpful,
    because learning about the successes of other students can be extremely motivating.

    learning journey is to build a community around it. For instance, you could try
    to set up a small deep learning meetup in your local neighborhood, or a study
    group, or even offer to do a talk at a local meetup about what you’ve learned
    so far or some particular aspect that interested you. It’s OK that you are not
    the world’s leading expert just yet—the important thing to remember is that you
    now know about plenty of stuff that other people don’t, so they are very likely
    to appreciate your perspective.

    or paper reading club. You might find some in your neighborhood already, and if
    not, you could try to get one started. Even if there is just one other person
    doing it with you, it will help give you the support and encouragement to get
    going.

    folks in person, drop by the forums, because people are always starting up virtual
    study groups. These generally involve a bunch of folks getting together over video
    chat once a week or so to discuss a deep learning topic.

    and experiments that you’ve run. Our recommendation for your next step is to pick
    one of these and make it as good as you can. Really polish it up into the best
    piece of work that you can—something you are really proud of. This will force
    you to go much deeper into a topic, which will test your understanding and give
    you the opportunity to see what you can do when you put your mind to it.

    that covers the same material as this book. Sometimes, seeing the same material
    in two ways can really help to crystallize the ideas. In fact, human learning
    researchers have found that one of the best ways to learn material is to see the
    same thing from different angles, described in different ways.

    give it to somebody you know—and get somebody else started on their own deep learning
    journey!
