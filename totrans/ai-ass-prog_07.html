<h1><span class="label">Chapter 6. </span>ChatGPT and Other General-Purpose LLMs</h1>&#13;
<p>In this chapter, we’re going to dive into some widely used general-purpose large language models<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_ChatGPT.06.3.99"/> that can whip up code. Sure, they might not have all the bells and whistles like those that specialize in coding—such as with integration with IDEs, sophisticated security, or guardrails for the types of code used to train the models—but they’re still impressive. Plus, they’re not just about coding; they’re also great for planning and brainstorming.</p>&#13;
<p>We’ll check out the big-name chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. I’ll walk through how to set them up, what they cost, what their cool features are, and how to get the most out of them.</p>&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="ChatGPT" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="chatgpt">&#13;
<h1>ChatGPT</h1>&#13;
<p>ChatGPT, short for Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer, exploded on the scene on November 30, 2022. OpenAI<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenAI" data-type="indexterm" id="id666"/>, the brains behind the app, didn’t really splash out on marketing. Turns out, they didn’t have to. ChatGPT quickly blew up and went viral all on its own.</p>&#13;
<p>In just five days, this app pulled in a million users, and within a couple of months, the number of users <a href="https://oreil.ly/jgzv7">skyrocketed to 100 million</a>. It became the quickest-growing platform in internet history.</p>&#13;
<p>Sandhini Agarwal<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Agarwal, Sandhini" data-type="indexterm" id="id667"/>, who helps to develop policy at OpenAI, <a href="https://oreil.ly/54fAU">noted</a>, “I think it was definitely a surprise for all of us how much people began using it. We work on these models so much, we forget how surprising they can be for the outside world sometimes.”</p>&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">The buzz kept growing. By September, ChatGPT had over 1.5 billion visits, and <a href="https://oreil.ly/Xlv3B">revenues had shot up to $1.2 billion</a>, a massive leap from a mere $28 million in 2022. But it wasn’t all about ChatGPT itself. There was also a booming business with OpenAI’s API.</p>&#13;
<p>Let’s get the quick backstory on OpenAI. It started up in 2015 and had some big names from Silicon Valley backing it, like Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, John Schulman, and Wojciech Zaremba. They were ready to pitch in up to a cool $1 billion to get things rolling.</p>&#13;
<p>OpenAI kicked off as a nonprofit, and it had more of an academic vibe, staffed mostly with PhDs in data science and AI. The mission was to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="artificial general intelligence (AGI)" data-type="indexterm" id="id668"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AGI (artificial general intelligence)" data-type="indexterm" id="id669"/>, the technology that can outdo humans in most tasks that matter. The goal had an altruistic component: to use AGI for the greater good and steer clear of any uses that might hurt people or give too much power to the few.</p>&#13;
<p>In the early days, OpenAI was focused on research and sharing its findings with others. The organization made its patents and code public, working hand in hand with other institutions. But the cost of creating cutting-edge generative AI systems was steep.</p>&#13;
<p>To keep its big dreams alive and bring in the right people, OpenAI created a “capped” for-profit company in 2019. This meant they could now legally get cash from venture funds and strategic investors, as well as give their employees a slice of the pie. That same year, Microsoft came in with a $1 billion investment. A few more rounds of investment brought in a total of about $3 billion from Microsoft. Fast-forward to April 2023, and the tech giant went all in, dropping a whopping $10 billion into the mix.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="GPT-4" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="gpthyphenfour">&#13;
<h1>GPT-4</h1>&#13;
<p>OpenAI’s GPT-4 model<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GPT-4 model (ChatGPT)" data-type="indexterm" id="id670"/> exhibits remarkable versatility in code generation, owing to its diverse training data encompassing a broad spectrum of sources. This extensive training has enabled human-level performance on several professional and academic benchmarks, and GPT-4 has consistently outperformed GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 in most programming languages. This is largely due to its enhanced ability to follow complex instructions expressed in natural language and generate technical or creative works with greater depth. Another key factor is the 32K context window<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="context window" data-secondary="GPT-4" data-type="indexterm" id="id671"/>.</p>&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">Interestingly, when evaluated on specific code generation benchmarks, an enhanced version of GPT-4 integrated with Reflexion<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Reflexion" data-type="indexterm" id="id672"/>—a framework for creating sophisticated agents based on LLMs—rocked an impressive <a href="https://oreil.ly/DFaDj">88% pass rate on HumanEval</a>. This score was notably higher than that of the base version of GPT-4, which had a 67% pass rate. This suggests that, with certain improvements, GPT-4 can attain state-of-the-art performance in code generation tasks.</p>&#13;
<p>When pitted against competitive programming scenarios on the Codeforces platform, <a href="https://oreil.ly/icUjw">GPT-4 scored a rating of 392 points</a>, an improvement over GPT-3.5’s 260 points. However, GPT-4 is still a newbie in the world of competitive programming, and these scores are in the bottom 5%. Even though GPT-4 has come a long way, it still has a lot of catching up to do to match human skills in tough coding challenges.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Navigating ChatGPT" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="navigating_chatgpt">&#13;
<h1>Navigating ChatGPT</h1>&#13;
<p>For this chapter<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-secondary="navigating" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_ChatGPTnavigating.06.24.20"/>, I will be using the premium version of ChatGPT, ChatGPT Plus. A monthly subscription costs $20.</p>&#13;
<p>Here’s the cool stuff you get:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>Always in</dt><dd><p>Even when everyone’s trying to use ChatGPT, premium subscribers get preferential access during peak times.</p></dd>&#13;
<dt>Quick replies</dt><dd><p>Things move faster with ChatGPT Plus. You get your answers quicker, making chats smoother and more fun.</p></dd>&#13;
<dt>First dibs on new offerings</dt><dd><p>If there’s a shiny new feature or an upgrade, Plus members get to try it out before everyone else.</p></dd>&#13;
<dt>Latest model</dt><dd><p>You get access to it.</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#the_interface_for_the_chatgpt_system_all">Figure 6-1</a> shows the interface for ChatGPT.</p>&#13;
<p>At the top left, you can hover over the dropdown to select the model you want or to access the plugin store. On the left side of the screen, you can click a button to create a new chat session. At the bottom, you will see your user profile, where you can get information about your ChatGPT plan, change your settings, and add custom instructions. You can also change the theme for the UI: options include system, dark, and light. Then at the bottom, there is the input box where you can enter a prompt.</p>&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="the_interface_for_the_chatgpt_system_all">&#13;
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0601.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 6-1. </span>The interface for the ChatGPT system allows you to select the GPT model you want and enter prompts</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>Let’s try out some of the features. Suppose you want to create code. You enter this into ChatGPT:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Write a Python code snippet that calculates the factorial of a number.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#chatgpt_has_created_a_python_code_snippe">Figure 6-2</a> shows the response.</p>&#13;
<p>Suppose you want to see if there are other ways to create the code. You can ask:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What is another way to create this code?</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>ChatGPT provides another code suggestion, which is called the iterative approach. But suppose you do not know what this is? Again, you can continue with your chat. As you do this, the chat session will be logged in the top left of the screen, as you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#chatgpt_logs_chat_sessions_at_the_top_le">Figure 6-3</a>. ChatGPT labels the chat “Factorial Calculation in Python.” If you want, you can rename it by clicking the icon next to it. There is also a delete icon.</p>&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="chatgpt_has_created_a_python_code_snippe">&#13;
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0602.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 6-2. </span>ChatGPT has created a Python code snippet in response to a prompt</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="chatgpt_logs_chat_sessions_at_the_top_le">&#13;
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0603.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 6-3. </span>ChatGPT logs chat sessions at the top left of the screen</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>Want to create a new session? Click the pencil icon at the top. You’ll get a blank screen.</p>&#13;
<p>Keep in mind that each session is self-contained. So if you ask ChatGPT in a later session about the code it created for the factorial calculation, it will not know what you are referring to.</p>&#13;
<p>Something else to consider is the context window<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="context window" data-secondary="GPT-4" data-type="indexterm" id="id673"/> for the chat session. This is important because it determines how much of the previous conversation or text the model can “remember” and use to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. For GPT-3.5, the context window is 16K, but for GPT-4, it is 32K.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>If you want to delete all the chat threads, you will click your profile at the bottom left of the screen and select Settings and Beta. Then click the Clear button.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>When you select your profile and then Settings &amp; Beta, you’ll find other options for your ChatGPT data:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>Switching off chat history and model training</dt><dd><p>If you turn off your chat history, your new chats won’t be used for training the AI and won’t show up in the history on the side panel. But OpenAI will still hang on to all chats for 30 days before they’re gone for good, primarily for legal purposes.</p></dd>&#13;
<dt>Sharing chats</dt><dd><p>Got an interesting thread? You can turn it into a link and share it with others.</p></dd>&#13;
<dt>Downloading your chat data</dt><dd><p>Choose this, and you’ll get an email with all your ChatGPT conversations.</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>Sometimes, ChatGPT might stop in the middle of generating text. When this happens, usually you’ll see a Continue button pop up. Click that button to keep the text rolling. If there’s no button, just type “continue output” in the prompt. And if it’s not giving you what you’re after, just click the Stop Generating button to put a pause on it.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Mobile App" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="mobile_app">&#13;
<h2>Mobile App</h2>&#13;
<p>ChatGPT’s got your back on both iOS and Android devices<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-secondary="mobile app" data-type="indexterm" id="id674"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="mobile apps" data-secondary="ChatGPT" data-type="indexterm" id="id675"/>. The apps are fairly similar to the web version, although, at least for now, they do not have features like <span class="keep-together">plugins.</span></p>&#13;
<p>You can have voice chats with ChatGPT on your phone. This is convenient if you’re not a fan of typing on tiny screens. Just head over to the New Features section in the settings and opt in to get started. Once you’ve turned this feature on, tap the headphone icon at the top-right corner of the home screen to start talking with ChatGPT. You get to pick from five different voices for ChatGPT to chat back with. This voice system works thanks to a generative AI text-to-speech model called Whisper.</p>&#13;
<p>The mobile version of ChatGPT makes chatting even more fun by letting you share pictures with the assistant. You can snap a photo of anything, like an object, a landmark, or even some code, and then dive into a chat with ChatGPT about it. There’s also a nifty drawing tool in the app, so you can highlight a specific part of your image while you’re talking about it.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Custom Instructions" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="custom_instructions">&#13;
<h2>Custom Instructions</h2>&#13;
<p>With custom instructions<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-secondary="custom instructions" data-type="indexterm" id="id676"/> in ChatGPT, you can tweak how the responses come out to suit what you need. This feature lets you save time because you don’t have to keep fine-tuning responses or coming up with new prompts every time you chat with the bot. You can switch on custom instructions in your profile.</p>&#13;
<p>When you set up a custom instruction, you’ll need to answer these two questions:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>ChatGPT:</em> What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better <span class="keep-together">responses?</span></p>&#13;
<p><em>ChatGPT:</em> How would you like ChatGPT to respond?</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Let’s take an example:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>ChatGPT:</em> What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Developer:</em> I am a programmer working with a team that follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python code. We value clean, readable code and adhere to best practices. I usually work on data processing and analysis tasks, and I often need help with writing efficient and well-structured code.</p>&#13;
<p><em>ChatGPT:</em> How would you like ChatGPT to respond?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Developer:</em> I would like ChatGPT to provide Python code snippets that adhere to the PEP 8 style guide. It should prioritize readability and best practices in coding. When suggesting solutions, I prefer explanations as to why a particular approach is recommended and how it aligns with PEP 8 standards. I would also appreciate it if ChatGPT could point out any common pitfalls or errors related to the task at hand and provide tips for avoiding them<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_ChatGPTnavigating.06.24.20" data-type="indexterm" id="id677"/>.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Browse with Bing" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="browse_wing_bing">&#13;
<h1>Browse with Bing</h1>&#13;
<p>ChatGPT’s training<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-secondary="Browsing with Bing" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_ChatGPTBrowsingwithBing.06.96.22"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Browsing with Bing" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_BrowsingwithBing.06.96.22"/> has a cutoff of April 2023. This can be a problem for developers. With libraries, frameworks, and tools changing so fast, any number of new features or capabilities may have popped up since then, and ChatGPT won’t be up-to-date on them.</p>&#13;
<p>But ChatGPT’s got a trick up its sleeve: Browsing with Bing. It lets you do real-time web searches to come up with answers.</p>&#13;
<p>Let’s say you’re checking out a new framework, like LangChain<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LangChain and Browse with Bing" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_LangChainandBrowsewithBing.06.98.65"/>. It’s been on the scene since late 2022, and it has evolved a lot. It’s also designed to make app development with LLMs smoother, so you might like to use it.</p>&#13;
<p>To activate Browse with Bing and enhance ChatGPT’s understanding of where LangChain is at right now, add something like “Use the internet for this response” to your prompt. Here are some examples of prompts designed to get general information about LangChain:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Tell me about the LangChain framework and its primary features. Use the internet for the response.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Check the internet for introductory resources or documentation for getting started with LangChain.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Browse the internet for examples of applications that have been built using the LangChain framework.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Look up any recent updates or releases related to the LangChain framework. Use the internet for the response.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>When responding to these prompts, ChatGPT did provide fairly useful answers. For example, for the first prompt, ChatGPT came up with five main features of LangChain, which you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#using_the_browse_with_bing_function_help">Figure 6-4</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can also change the format of this content. Try this prompt:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Turn this into a table.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#when_prompted_to_do_socomma_chatgpt_can">Figure 6-5</a> shows the result.</p>&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 6-4. </span>Using the Browse with Bing function helps ChatGPT to research the main features of the LangChain framework</h6>&#13;

<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0605.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 6-5. </span>When prompted to do so, ChatGPT can put its output into a table</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>When you use Browse with Bing, ChatGPT might take a few seconds or maybe even a minute or more to respond. Sometimes ChatGPT may even get stuck and spit out an error. You might have to give it a few goes before you get an answer. ChatGPT can sometimes be temperamental.</p>&#13;
<p>When you use Browse with Bing, the output will often have a web link to the source<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sources of information" data-secondary="instructing ChatGPT to use specific" data-type="indexterm" id="id678"/> of the information. It’s a good idea to click on it to verify the content. After all, you have to take everything generated by ChatGPT with a grain of salt. Sometimes the response might come from a social media post, for instance, and that’s not always the most reliable source.</p>&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-after">Fortunately, you can instruct ChatGPT to focus on certain types of sources. <a data-type="xref" href="#ways_to_instruct_chatgpt_to_use_certain">Table 6-1</a> provides some suggestions.</p>&#13;
<table class="border" id="ways_to_instruct_chatgpt_to_use_certain">&#13;

</table>&#13;
<p>So how well does ChatGPT do with creating code for LangChain? Let’s see. Here’s a prompt for a simple program:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I want to write a Python program that uses the LangChain framework. It will have the following features:</p>&#13;
<p>1. Get input from the user about a topic.</p>&#13;
<p>2. Select the type of content to create: blog or social media post.</p>&#13;
<p>3. Use LangChain to access the OpenAI API to create either the blog or social media post based on the topic.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>When I tried this in ChatGPT, the results were, well, meh. Sure, it nailed the basic Python code structure for user input—no shocker there, since ChatGPT is sharp with Python. But with the LangChain code? Way off base. It goofed up the LangChain library import and missed some other things, too. Plus, it was clueless about how to call the OpenAI <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_LangChainandBrowsewithBing.06.98.65" data-type="indexterm" id="id679"/>API.</p>&#13;
<p>Bottom line: Browse with Bing is mostly handy for your everyday, general <span class="keep-together">questions—at</span> least for now<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_ChatGPTBrowsingwithBing.06.96.22" data-type="indexterm" id="id680"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_BrowsingwithBing.06.96.22" data-type="indexterm" id="id681"/>.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Tedious Tasks" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="tedious_tasks">&#13;
<h1>Tedious Tasks</h1>&#13;
<p>Software development can easily get complicated with lots of steps. You’ve got planning, coding, and testing to name just a few. One part that can be a real drag is the repetitive coding. It’s dull and eats up a ton of time. Developers often end up stuck writing the same routine code, squashing bugs, and looking over code. True, this is all important, but it’s not exactly the fun, creative part of making software. Besides, trying to keep up with new programming languages, frameworks, and tools can be <span class="keep-together">overwhelming</span>.</p>&#13;
<p>AI tools like ChatGPT can take the edge off those boring bits of software development. In the next few sections, we’ll dive into some of these areas.</p>&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Regular Expressions" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="regular_expressions">&#13;
<h2>Regular Expressions</h2>&#13;
<p><em>Regular expressions</em>, or <em>regex</em>, are a nifty tool for working with text<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-secondary="regular expressions" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_ChatGPTregularexpressions.06.166.91"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="regular expressions (regex) (ChatGPT)" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_regularexpressionsregexChatGPT.06.166.91"/>. Think of them like a powerful find-and-replace functionality that can spot patterns in strings of characters. But here’s the kicker: regex is like learning a whole new language of symbols and commands. It can be a brain twister! Trying to remember all those weird combinations of backslashes, dots, brackets, and who-knows-what-else is enough to make your head spin. Sometimes, it feels like you need a secret decoder ring just to make sense of it all.</p>&#13;
<p>For example, take a regex pattern like this:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><code>^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&amp;])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&amp;]{8,}$</code></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>This would be used to validate a strong password, ensuring it has at least eight characters, including one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.</p>&#13;
<p>You probably wouldn’t enjoy writing that, but ChatGPT can create a regex. Here’s a look at some common examples:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Create a regex pattern to validate standard email addresses. The email should start with alphanumeric characters, followed by optional dots, hyphens, or underscores. Then, there should be an “@” symbol, followed by more alphanumeric characters, a dot, and finally, a domain name that is 2 to 6 characters long.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Regex pattern:</em> ^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt</em>: Provide me with a regex pattern to validate URLs. The URL may start with “http” or “https”, followed by “://”, then a domain name which can include alphanumeric characters and dots. After the domain, there can be an optional path that starts with a “/” and can include alphanumeric characters, slashes, dots, or hyphens. The URL may end with an optional “/”.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Regex pattern:</em> ^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z.-]+)\.([a-z.]{2,6})([\/\w .-]*)*\/?$</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt</em>: Create a regex pattern to validate dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format. The month should be between 01 and 12, the day should be between 01 and 31, and the year should be either in the 1900s or 2000s.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Regex pattern:</em> ^(0[1-9]|1[0-2])\/(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])\/(19|20)\d\d$</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I’m looking for a regex pattern to validate IPv4 addresses. Each octet should be a number between 0 and 255, and the octets should be separated by dots. Create a regex pattern for this.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Regex pattern:</em> ^(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d\d?)\.((25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d\d?)\.){2}(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d\d?)$</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>ChatGPT can also help you decipher regex patterns. Here’s a sample prompt:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What is this regex? ^(\(\d{3}\)\s?|\d{3}[-.])\d{3}[-.]\d{4}$</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;

<p><em>Starter code</em> is the initial code<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-secondary="starter code" data-type="indexterm" id="id684"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="starter code (ChatGPT)" data-type="indexterm" id="id685"/> snippets or templates that give you a head start. No doubt, it can be a big time saver. But starter code can be a learning tool as well. If you’re new to coding, poking around some starter code can help you figure out how things work. What’s more, starter code helps keep things consistent, especially in big teams where everyone needs to be on the same page.</p>&#13;
<p>Here’s an example:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">const express = require('express');&#13;
const app = express();&#13;
const port = 3000;&#13;
app.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {&#13;
 res.send('Hello, World!');&#13;
});&#13;
app.listen(port, () =&gt; {&#13;
 console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);&#13;
});</pre>&#13;
<p>This provides a concise and clear example of a basic web server created using Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js. It is good starter code because of its simplicity and use of core elements. <a data-type="xref" href="#prompts_for_starter_code">Table 6-2</a> shows some prompts for starter code.</p>&#13;

<h2>GitHub README</h2>&#13;
<p>The <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-secondary="GitHub README file" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_ChatGPTGitHubREADMEfile.06.249.8"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub README file" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_GitHubREADMEfile.06.249.8"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="README file (GitHub)" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_READMEfileGitHub.06.249.8"/>GitHub <em>README file</em> is essentially the welcome mat for a repository. It’s where you find out what the project’s all about—its purpose, what it does, and how to use it. Usually called <em>README.md</em>, it’s written in Markdown, which is for making things look nice and be easy to read. You’ll see the README on the main page of the repo.</p>&#13;
<p>A well-written README is important because it makes everything smoother for anyone checking out your project. It sets the tone and helps to make the project clearer, whether a user wants to use the project or wants to contribute to it. The README will also lay down the rules and what to expect.</p>&#13;
<p>Writing a README is not always a walk in the park. You have to find the sweet spot between giving all the juicy details and keeping it concise. Developers, who are focused on their coding, might skip over important parts, not realizing that what’s obvious to them isn’t obvious to everyone.</p>&#13;
<p>For crafting a good README, you do need some writing chops. But this is not necessarily the strong point of a developer. Moreover, as your project grows and changes, keeping the README up-to-date is a whole thing on its own. Yes, it can be a juggling act.</p>&#13;
<p>But with ChatGPT on your side, whipping up a README can be a breeze and the content should be pretty solid. Let’s take an example. Imagine you’ve just built this awesome app for digging up recipes. Here’s a prompt to kick things off:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Write a GitHub readme for my project named “Recipe Finder.” This project is developed using Vue.js and helps users find recipes based on the ingredients they have. Users need to input the ingredients they have, and the app will return a list of recipes they can cook with those ingredients. To kickstart, simply clone the repository, run npm install, insert your API key into the .env file, and execute npm start to launch <span class="keep-together">the app.</span></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>ChatGPT creates an introduction to the project and then includes sections like <span class="keep-together">Features,</span> Getting Started, Usage, Contributing, License, and Acknowledgments.</p>&#13;
<p>For some sections of the README, ChatGPT made assumptions. For example, it specified that the project uses the MIT License. But you can continue to prompt ChatGPT to provide more details about the project.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;

They let you do many sorts of tasks, like move around in your files, keep tabs on what your computer’s doing, and manipulate files.</p>&#13;
<p>Getting the hang of bash commands can be tough, especially if you’re new to the Unix/Linux world. The way some commands are written can be cryptic and hard to grasp at first. It takes a fair bit of time and practice to really get good at it. Furthermore, there are a lot of commands, each with their own bunch of options and twists. Sure, there are resources on the internet to help out. Yet even the pros can have a hard time remembering commands they don’t use often or only recently picked up.</p>&#13;
<p>However, you can use ChatGPT as your virtual assistant for working with bash commands. Here are some example prompts:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How can I use a bash command to list all the files in a directory sorted by modification time?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What is the bash command to count the number of lines in a file?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How can I create a directory and navigate into it using a single command?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How can I redirect the output of a command to a file?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What is the command to search for a specific process running on my system?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How can I compress a directory into a ZIP file using bash?</p>&#13;

It lets developers set up, customize, and run their software development workflows directly in their repos. Basically, a GitHub Actions workflow is a set of automated processes you define in a workflow file. The processes are made up of jobs, each doing a different thing like running commands, setting up processes, or running actions. They’re written in YAML syntax and kick into gear when certain actions happen, like pushing code, making a new issue, or scheduling times. With GitHub Actions, developers can build, test, and deploy their code straight from GitHub, making their software development process smoother and more automated. You can share, reuse, or even tweak other developers’ actions, which is great for teamwork and sharing know-how in the world of automated software development.</p>&#13;
<p>ChatGPT can help you create GitHub Actions. Here are some prompts:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Create a GitHub Actions workflow template to build and deploy a static website using Hugo, with deployment to GitHub Pages.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Generate a GitHub Actions workflow template for a Java project using Maven, including steps for compiling the code, running tests, and packaging the application.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Create a GitHub Actions workflow template for a Dockerized application, including steps for building the Docker image, pushing it to Docker Hub, and deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Generate a GitHub Actions workflow template for a React Native mobile application, including steps for installing dependencies, building the app, and uploading the APK to a specified Google Drive folder.</p>&#13;

<p>To use plugins, you first need to make sure you have the feature activated. Go to your profile and select Settings and then Beta Features.</p>&#13;
<p>You can find the plugins by hovering over the GPT-4 icon—at the top of the screen—and then choosing Plugins. Click this, and you will get the screen shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#the_chatgpt_plugin_store_gives_you_acces">Figure 6-6</a>.</p>&#13;

<p>This plugin has two main functions. One is to allow users to find specific courses or paths based on their goals and experience level. For instance, users interested in AI and ChatGPT can ask the plugin for course recommendations, and it will provide a list of relevant courses, including descriptions and information on whether the courses are free or paid.</p>&#13;
<p>Next, the plugin serves as a quick reference tool for technical documentation, providing links to documents and articles with more detailed information.</p>&#13;
<p>We’ll test this part out:</p>&#13;

<h1>GPTs</h1>&#13;
<p>You can create your own custom ChatGPT<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-secondary="custom GPTs" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_ChatGPTcustomGPTs.06.362.42"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="custom GPTs" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_customGPTs.06.362.42"/>. It’s called a GPT, and it is very easy to put together—often taking just a few minutes.</p>&#13;
<p>Let’s look at an example. We’ll create a GPT for a software development style guide. This is packed with nuts-and-bolts guidelines like how to name your variables so they make sense to everyone, the right way to indent your code, and the specific programming patterns or practices the team follows. It’s a dress code for your code.</p>&#13;
<p>The idea is to make everything uniform and tidy. This makes it easier for everyone to read and understand the codebase, which can be a lifesaver during big projects.</p>&#13;
<p>But here’s the catch: if you’re new to this, it can be a bit overwhelming. You might be used to coding a certain way, and suddenly you’ve got to adapt to new standards.</p>&#13;
<p>This is where a GPT can help. So let’s create one. First, on the home screen of ChatGPT—at the top left—select Explore and then choose Create a GPT. You will get a screen with two panels, as you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#the_gpt_builder_lets_you_create_a_custom">Figure 6-8</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The left panel is where you build the GPT, and the right one is a preview area. To have it work with a development style guide, your prompt would look like this:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Make a system that enforces a software development style guide.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="the_gpt_builder_lets_you_create_a_custom">&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 6-8. </span>The GPT Builder lets you create a custom GPT</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>ChatGPT will start to create the instructions for the GPT. This prompt is somewhat vague, but ChatGPT will ask some questions to get more information. It will first suggest a name for the GPT—it suggests “Code Stylist.”</p>&#13;
<p>It will then create a profile image for the GPT by using DALL·E 3. But you could upload your own image instead.</p>&#13;
<p>Then it will ask for details like the language or languages, the practices, guidelines, rules, what should be avoided, and so on. Say you tell it the language is Python and give it some other requirements.</p>&#13;
<p>Next, on the top of the panel, select the Configure tab. You can then upload your style guide.</p>&#13;
<p>You can then go to the right panel to experiment with the GPT. If you ask it to write code, it will automatically work in Python and abide by your rules.</p>&#13;
<p>You can save this GPT by clicking the icon at the top right. It will then show up on your main screen. To use it, just click the GPT icon.</p>&#13;
<p>OpenAI has also created an appstore for GPTs. You navigate to this by selecting Explore GPTs at the top left of the screen of ChatGPT.</p>&#13;
<p>One of the categories is for programming. Here are some examples of the GPTs that are available:</p>&#13;

Even with all its early moves and big-bucks investment in AI, Google wasn’t ready for the generative AI wave. Google was wary about jumping into the new-fangled technology—worried about its accuracy and its effect on the company’s lucrative ad business. But then, early in 2023, Google’s stock took a dip, and that shook things up. The company decided to make a move and rolled out Bard, its own take on generative AI, kind of a comeback to ChatGPT. Bard had a few bumps at the start, but it got better, finding its way into different Google apps and helping the company’s stock bounce back.</p>&#13;
<p>In February 2024, Google renamed the Bard platform Gemini. In addition to a free version, there’s now also a premium offering, Gemini Advanced, which costs $19.99 per month after two free initial months. It uses Google’s most sophisticated LLM, which is called Ultra 1.0. According to <a href="https://oreil.ly/WYs67">Google</a>: “It can help you with more advanced coding scenarios, serving as a sounding board for ideas and helping you evaluate different coding approaches.”</p>&#13;
<p>Google also launched a mobile<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="mobile apps" data-secondary="Gemini" data-type="indexterm" id="id715"/> version of Gemini for Android and iOS. With the app, you can type, talk, or use images to interact with the LLM. <a data-type="xref" href="#the_user_interface_for_gemini_allows_you">Figure 6-9</a> shows the interface for Gemini.</p>&#13;

<p>If you want to clear out all or just some of your items—based on when they <span class="keep-together">happened—head</span> over to the bottom left and click on Activity. Here, you can also tell Gemini if you want it to hang onto your prompts or just let them go.</p>&#13;
<p>In the middle of the screen, you’ll find some helpful tips on how to use Gemini, as well as some security heads-ups. Down at the bottom is where you type in your prompts. And over on the right is your spot for uploading images. Gemini can pull out text, spot objects and scenes, answer questions about the pics, and even whip up some creative text formats.</p>&#13;
<p>The right side of the input box also has a microphone icon. This allows you to use speech-to-text to generate text for Gemini.</p>&#13;
<p>So what about plugins<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="plugins" data-secondary="Gemini extensions" data-type="indexterm" id="id716"/>? Does Gemini have its own version? It does, and they are called extensions. Currently, they only are for Google applications like Flights, Hotels, Maps, Workspace, and YouTube; there are no third-party extensions.</p>&#13;
<p>Finally, Gemini has real-time access to the internet. Its responses will include citations so you can verify the source<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sources of information" data-secondary="verifying with Gemini" data-type="indexterm" id="id717"/>.</p>&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Applications" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="applications">&#13;
<h2>Applications</h2>&#13;
<p>Productivity apps like Excel and Google Sheets aren’t just for spreadsheets. They’ve got their own programming languages to amp up what they can do. Take Excel, for instance. It’s got Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which is a beefy programming system that lets you cook up your own scripts and programs. It’s great for automating the same old tasks, making special functions, and analyzing your data. Excel also comes loaded with many ready-to-go functions, like PivotTables and Power Query, and it plays nice with Power BI for some top-notch data visuals and analysis.</p>&#13;
<p>Google Sheets<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Google Sheets use case (Gemini)" data-type="indexterm" id="id718"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="spreadsheets, analyzing with Gemini" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_spreadsheetsanalyzingwithGemini.06.412.17"/>, on the other hand, rolls with Google Apps Script, which is like <span class="keep-together">JavaScript’s</span> cousin. It lets you do tasks similar to those you can do in Excel. But in addition, there are smooth integrations to Google apps like Drive and Gmail. Google Sheets is also packed with its own set of ready-to-use functions, and you can boost it with different add-ons from the Google Workspace Marketplace. Being entirely cloud based makes it great for teaming up with others, and it’s a solid pick for web apps and group projects.</p>&#13;
<p>Then can Gemini help out? Definitely. For example, you can use it to explain a formula. No doubt, formulas can get quite complicated. Here’s an example:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Explain the following Excel formula: =SUM(OFFSET(A1,1,0,COUNT(A:A),1))</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>For Gemini, making sense of this is no problem.</p>&#13;
<p>Another use case is to create VBA scripts<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="VBA scripts use case (Gemini)" data-type="indexterm" id="id719"/>. Here are some sample prompts:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How can I create a custom form in Excel using VBA for entering user login details?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Can you help me write a VBA script for Excel to protect specific data with a password?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I need VBA code to validate email addresses and date formats in my Excel user login sheet. Can you assist?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Is it possible to send automated email notifications from Excel using VBA to get updates about user login information?</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>While all this is great, when it comes to working with spreadsheets, it’s important to understand the relationships among the data, formulas, and scripts. Knowing how they dance together helps you build models that are powerful and don’t trip up on errors. After all, if you tweak something in your data, the change can ripple through your formulas and mess with what your scripts output, and before you know it, your final results have done a total 180.</p>&#13;
<p>But Gemini can load and analyze Excel spreadsheets. You can then ask questions about them, such as to get a step-by-step understanding or to highlight a certain area of your data or logic.</p>&#13;
<p>Let’s take an example. Suppose you have an Excel spreadsheet with data on book sales. Here are some example prompts<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_spreadsheetsanalyzingwithGemini.06.412.17" data-type="indexterm" id="id720"/>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Can you show me how to find the highest royalty amount earned by an author in Excel?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I want to calculate the inventory turnover rate for each book in Excel. What formula should I use?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How do I create a stock shortage alert in Excel, indicating when to order more based on the reorder level?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How do I calculate the percentage of positive reviews (ratings 4 or higher) for books in Excel?</p>&#13;
