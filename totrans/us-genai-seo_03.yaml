- en: Large language models (LLMs)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LLMs are at the core of generative AI tools. They are algorithms trained to
    understand language based on a crawl of the open internet and/or other large data
    sources. These are based on neural networks, and their size is measured by the
    number of parameters used in the neural network during the training of the algorithm.
    Increasing the size of a neural network has the potential to increase the power
    and accuracy of the LLM, but increases in network size can offer diminishing returns
    or even introduce new errors (due to the network “overfitting” the data) if the
    number of parameters grows too large.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Designed to process data in a manner inspired by the human brain, neural networks
    are one of the most powerful approaches to training AI algorithms. They use multiple
    layers of *nodes* (also called *parameters* or *neurons*) to receive input, process
    that input, and then deliver an output. Conceptually, this process is like solving
    an algebraic equation, but in training LLMs, the complexity can involve hundreds
    of millions—or even trillions—of data points.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nodes
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A node represents a data point in a neural network. Calculations are performed
    at each node based on the input parameters to the node. The node then outputs
    a parameter that feeds into a node in the next layer of the neural network or
    becomes an output.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Parameters
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Parameters are the components of a neural network model that need to be calculated.
    These act as inputs into nodes that provide weights into that node. Larger numbers
    of parameters indicate a more complex neural network that can solve more complex
    problems.

- en: Prompts
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A prompt is user input sent to an LLM for processing and output. Prompts play
    the same role in generative AI that queries do in search—they’re how the user
    indicates what they’re looking for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tokens
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tokens are units of measurement to describe how much input you can provide your
    generative AI tool as well as how much output it will provide you. The number
    of tokens in an input (or output) is normally somewhat larger than the number
    of words. Each LLM uses its own process for tokenization of words, but tokens
    can consist of whole words, parts of words, or individual characters. On average,
    one token generally consists of about four characters. The reason we talk about
    this metric is because it relates to how generative AI tools break down input
    and output to determine their maximum size, and therefore, these are constraints
    on how you use the tools.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although AI had its start in the 1950s, the world was turned upside down by
    OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022\. For the first time, the market
    had a tool that enabled users to have meaningful, in-depth, and interactive text
    conversations with an AI. ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Gemini, and Claude can maintain
    the context of a conversation through numerous prompts and provide meaningful
    answers to complex questions or generate complete pieces of content. Although
    tools existed previously that you could give verbal commands to or interact with,
    none of them had the depth and capability of this new generation of AI tools.^([1](ch02.html#id384))
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What makes these capabilities so expansive is that they are based on LLMs that
    are trained on large portions of the open internet. This has great potential because
    a high percentage of the world’s information is on the internet, but unfortunately,
    so is much of the world’s disinformation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, LLMs don’t really learn from all the information they process. They
    are highly complex mathematical models that can repeat back answers based on what
    they have seen on the web, but they don’t understand the meaning behind those
    answers. They don’t know how to interpret whether information is right or wrong.
    Companies like OpenAI, Google, and Claude do supplemental training with other
    algorithms to help improve the quality of the results. Unfortunately, these additional
    training processes can’t resolve all the issues. We’ll discuss these issues in
    more detail in [“Limitations of Generative AI”](#ch02_limitations_of_generative_ai_1748358211790682).

    was integrated natively into ChatGPT-4 Plus for some users in October 2023\. Bing
    and ChatGPT now have fully integrated DALL-E. Gemini also provides image-creation
    capabilities. These tools can be highly creative. As an example, you can see the

    built on a massive number of parameters and make it directly accessible to the
    public as a tool. Google’s BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

    is based on 1.76 trillion parameters and is actually composed of eight different
    models trained on 220 billion parameters. It is speculated that each of these
    models is trained on different topical areas. The model chosen to respond to a
    user prompt is determined based on which model has the most relevant knowledge

    use adjectives and adverbs considerably more than human writers do. The study

    While Google has provided no confirmation of this (and there is no reason to expect

    sites that are producing the best content.

    it has the potential to negatively affect the clicks that Google sends to third-party

    will fall. [Gartner](https://oreil.ly/PR6xo) has come out with a prediction that
    search engine usage will decline 25% by 2026\. Given the quality issues with generative
    AI responses, it will be interesting to see if this prediction proves to be the
    case. In addition, the integration of AI responses into the traditional search
    results will lower clicks delivered to web sites as well. As previously mentioned,
    a recent study by Ahrefs showed that clicks from Google results showing AI Overviews

    OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggested that the age of giant AI models was already over.
    Altman suggested that the logical limits of the existing technology had been reached,
    and simply continuing to scale it would not help the results get materially better.
