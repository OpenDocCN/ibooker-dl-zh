- en: I started coding back in the early ’80s. My first rig was an Atari 400—not exactly
    a powerhouse with its membrane keyboard, just 8K of RAM, and programs that loaded
    from cassettes. I learned the BASIC language and created simple games and utility
    apps.

- en: I was totally into it.

- en: Naturally, over time I upgraded to beefier machines. Along the way, I got my
    hands dirty with languages like Pascal, C, and C++. But the IDEs didn’t change
    much, except for syntax highlighting and debugging features.

- en: Everything changed dramatically with the arrival of GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT.
    Trying out these tools felt like the moment I first held an iPhone—absolutely
    game-changing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In natural language, I asked ChatGPT to write code. Or in VS Code, I would type
    a fragment of a function, and GitHub Copilot would generate a code block. Often
    it was like hitting the bull’s-eye. Oh, and then I used ChatGPT to turn images
    into code.

- en: Yet the real power was that these tools could handle many of the tedious tasks
    for developers. Who’s into wrestling with regex statements or piecing together
    bash commands or GitHub actions? Not me, for sure. But these AI programming tools?
    They eat that stuff for breakfast.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Turns out, these AI tools are handy for more than just coding. I began using
    ChatGPT for brainstorming app ideas, drafting requirements, and even knocking
    out unit tests.

    be one of those must-have skills for programmers.

- en: So yes, I saw a big need to write this book. I put together an outline and pitched
    it to O’Reilly. The folks there instantly saw the potential.
  prefs: []

    many smart developers who have provided me with great ideas and tips.

    companion [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ttaulli/AI-Assisted-Programming-Book).
    Here, I’ll make updates to the book and include other important developments in
    this exciting field.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1, “New World for Developers”](ch01.html#new_world_for_developers):
    This chapter kicks off with a look into how generative AI is changing the game
    for coders. It talks about how these AI tools are helping developers think more
    about the big picture and less about the nitty-gritty of coding. The chapter also
    takes a stroll through the history of programming languages. There are also details
    about the advanced AI technologies like GPT-4.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2, “How AI Coding Technology Works”](ch02.html#how_ai_coding_technology_works):
    The chapter starts off by explaining generative AI and why transformer models
    and large language models are big deals in the programming world. To top it off,
    there’s a walkthrough of OpenAI’s Playground, showing how you can play around
    with these AI models and tweak them to suit your coding needs.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3, “Prompt Engineering”](ch03.html#prompt_engineering): The information
    here is critical to using AI-assisted programming tools. This chapter is packed
    with practical tips, like dealing with wordy or confusing prompts and deterring
    AI from making stuff up. Plus, it breaks down the key parts of a prompt and shows
    you how to use them effectively.'

  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4, “GitHub Copilot”](ch04.html#github_copilot): This chapter is a
    walkthrough of this powerful tool. There’s a look at the core features like creating
    code with comments, Chat, and using an AI-powered command-line interface. There
    is also coverage of customizing the system for proprietary codebases.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Software developers thrive on certainty. When you give a program certain input,
    you always get the same output. For ages, this pure deterministic logic was the
    heart and soul of software.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But when you use AI-assisted programming tools, things get a bit topsy-turvy.
    Getting results is like rolling dice since everything works on probabilities.
    When you prompt an AI tool to whip up some code, and even use the same prompt
    over multiple tries, you might get different results each time. Sure, it’s a bit
    of a head-scratcher at first, but once you get the hang of it, it’s totally worth
    it. That’s why there is a chapter on prompt engineering that will help with this
    new approach to programming.
