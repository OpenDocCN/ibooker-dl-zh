<p>In part 1, you learned the mechanics of matching and ranking on keywords (using TF-IDF and BM25) and numerical vectors (using cosine and dot product). You were also introduced to an overview of crowdsourced relevance ranking. Before performing these ranking techniques, however, it’s important to be able to correctly interpret a user’s query and run an appropriate search that understands the user’s intent. If an incorrect query is run and the wrong documents are matched, no amount of ranking logic on those bad results is going to overcome a misinterpreted query.</p>

<p>Properly interpreting the user’s query is the focus of part 2. This step is often overlooked because it is very domain-specific, but it’s crucial for meeting a user’s information need. In chapter 5, you’ll learn to traverse semantic knowledge graphs, the giant graphs of hyperstructured data inside your search engine that were introduced in chapter 2. These graphs underpin search engines and enable inference of the nuanced meaning of domain-specific terms within your data. In chapter 6, you’ll learn to perform query intent classification, using these graphs to disambiguate different meanings of words and phrases, and how to leverage both your content and user behavioral signals to learn domain-specific terminology, related terms, misspellings, and alternate forms of terms. In chapter 7, we’ll tie everything you’ve learned together and build a query pipeline to perform semantic search. This pipeline will parse the domain-specific intent of your users’ queries and rewrite them to represent a more accurate semantic interpretation of the user’s intent to the search engine, resulting in far more relevant search results.</p>
