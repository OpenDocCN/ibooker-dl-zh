<p>In part 2, we’ll focus on learning how to represent causal relationships through causal graphs. We’ll also learn how to validate those causal graphs with data, as well as combine them with deep generative models. This part will equip you with the skills to systematically construct causal structures that represent real-world data generation processes and validate those structures empirically.</p>
