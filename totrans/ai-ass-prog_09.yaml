    the bread and butter of coding—playing around with functions and classes. Then,
    we’ll get our hands dirty with a bit of refactoring, tidying up messy code and
    making it run smoother. We’ll also show how to work with and create data. Then
    we’ll check out some AI tools that can help create fancy frontends without breaking

    They’re not the magic wand that can solve all our coding problems. Why? Well,
    these tools are like those students in class who only learn from public notes.
    They’re trained on a mishmash of code from all over the internet, and let’s be
    honest, not all of it is top-notch. What does this mean for you? Sometimes, you
    might get code that’s more bloated than a Thanksgiving turkey or as maintainable
    as a house of cards. And sometimes the code is just plain wrong, doesn’t do what
    you need, or, even worse, leaves your front door wide open for hackers or the
    hogging of your network resources.

    Let’s choose a project that we will implement on this technology—let it be an
    online store. To begin with, just ask ChatGPT how to start developing a new project
    on Django. It will tell you what dependencies you need to install, how to set
    up the initial configuration of the project, and what related technologies you
    will need to deal with. Then we move on to more specific requests such as “How
    is a model organized in Django?” “How to add a new section in the admin panel?”
    and “How to migrate the database?” By gradually gaining new knowledge and asking
    more and more detailed questions, you can realize almost any project on any previously
    unfamiliar technology. This is how I mastered Django literally through a weekend
    of fruitful work.

    With modular programming, coding is more organized, easier to understand, and
    easier to keep up with. It also makes teaming up with other coders a lot less
    of a headache because everyone’s not tripping over each other. Plus, modules are

    it less likely you’ll goof up.

    to get a solution, not the minutiae of the actual code I need to write. When I
    have a technical problem, I start by breaking it down into smaller pieces, where
    the inputs and outputs are clear. The reason for this is that the context window
    of the AI tool I’m using might not be sufficient to come up with a good solution
    in one shot. I found that it’s easier to debug and build if I ask the model to
    deliver code that uses a simple input, does one single job and provides an output
    I can verify. If I’m not happy with the intermediate output, I describe my issue
    to ChatGPT and attempt to run the updated code it delivers. Once I’m happy with
    the solution, I can add extra processing steps, either inside the existing function
    or that takes the output of the previous step and refines it further, closer to
    my desired solution.

    custom functions being called, etc.). This allows me to produce solutions that

    with these docs—some are clear and easy to follow, while others...not so much.
    Then there’s the deal with logging in and getting access, like using API keys
    or OAuth tokens. Plus, trying to figure out the data structures and response formats
    the API spits back at you can be overwhelming. Then there is error handling as
