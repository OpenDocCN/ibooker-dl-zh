likely follow your lead when they see that you value clear communication.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Challenge Jargon When It Comes Up"><div class="sect2" id="id51">
<h2>Challenge Jargon When It Comes Up</h2>
<p>If someone uses technical terms, ask them to explain in simple words.
This helps everyone understand and shows that it’s okay to ask
questions.</p>

<p><em>Example:</em> If a team member says, “Our AI needs
better <strong>guardrails</strong>,” you might ask, “Can you tell me
more about that? How can we make sure the AI gives safe and appropriate
answers?”</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Encourage Open Conversation"><div class="sect2" id="id52">
<h2>Encourage Open Conversation</h2>
<p>Make it okay for people to ask questions and say when they don’t
understand. Let your team know it’s good to seek clear explanations.
This creates a friendly environment where ideas can be shared
openly.</p>

<table class="striped">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Term</th>
<th>Short definition</th>
<th>Why it matters</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>AGI (artificial general intelligence)</strong></td>
<td>AI that can do any intellectual task a human can</td>
<td>While some define AGI as AI that’s as smart as a human in every way,
this isn’t something you need to focus on right now. It’s more important
to build AI solutions that solve your specific problems today.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Agents</strong></td>
<td>AI models that can perform tasks or run code without human
help</td>
<td>Agents can automate complex tasks by making decisions and taking
actions on their own. This can save time and resources, but you need to
watch them carefully to make sure they are safe and do what you
want.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Batch processing</strong></td>
<td>Handling many tasks at once</td>
<td>If you can wait for AI answers, you can process requests in batches
at a lower cost. For example, OpenAI offers batch processing that’s
cheaper but slower.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Chain of thought</strong></td>
<td>Prompting the model to think and plan before answering</td>
<td>When the model thinks first, it gives better answers but takes
longer. This trade-off affects speed and quality.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Chunking</strong></td>
<td>Breaking long texts into smaller parts</td>
<td>Splitting documents helps search them better. How you divide them
affects your results.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Context window</strong></td>
<td>The maximum text the model can use at once</td>
<td>The model has a limit on how much text it can handle. You need to
manage this to fit important information.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Distillation</strong></td>
<td>Making a smaller, faster model from a big one</td>
<td>It lets you use cheaper, faster models with less delay (latency).
But, the smaller model might not be as accurate or powerful as the big
one. So, you trade some performance for speed and cost savings.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Embeddings</strong></td>
<td>Turning words into numbers that show meaning</td>
<td>Embeddings let you search documents by meaning, not just exact
words. This helps you find information even if different words are used,
making searches smarter and more accurate.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Few-shot learning</strong></td>
<td>Teaching the model with only a few examples</td>
<td>By giving the model examples, you can guide it to behave the way you
want. It’s a simple but powerful way to teach the AI what is good or
bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Fine-tuning</strong></td>
<td>Adjusting a pre-trained model for a specific job</td>
<td>It helps make the AI better for your needs by teaching it with your
data, but it might become less good at general tasks. Fine-tuning works
best for specific jobs where you need higher accuracy.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Frequency penalties</strong></td>
<td>Settings to stop the model from repeating words</td>
<td>Helps make AI responses more varied and interesting, avoiding boring
repetition.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Function calling</strong></td>
<td>Getting the model to trigger actions or code</td>
<td>Allows AI to interact with apps, making it useful for tasks like
getting data or automating jobs.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Guardrails</strong></td>
<td>Safety rules to control model outputs</td>
<td>Guardrails help reduce the chance of the AI giving bad or harmful
answers, but they are not perfect. It’s important to use them wisely and
not rely on them completely.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Hallucination</strong></td>
<td>When AI makes up things that aren’t true</td>
<td>AIs sometimes make stuff up, and you can’t completely stop this.
It’s important to be aware that mistakes can happen, so you should check
the AI’s answers.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Hyperparameters</strong></td>
<td>Settings that affect how the model works</td>
<td>By adjusting these settings, you can make the AI work better. It
often takes trying different options to find what works best.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Hybrid search</strong></td>
<td>Combining search methods to get better results</td>
<td>By using both keyword and meaning-based search, you get
better results. Just using one might not work well. Combining them helps
people find what they’re looking for more easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Inference</strong></td>
<td>Getting an answer back from the model</td>
<td>When you ask the AI a question and it gives you an answer, that’s
called inference. It’s the process of the AI making predictions or
responses. Knowing this helps you understand how the AI works and the
time or resources it might need to give answers.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong><span class="keep-together">Inference endpoint</span></strong></td>
<td>Where the model is available for use</td>
<td>Lets you use the AI model in your apps or services.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Latency</strong></td>
<td>The time delay in getting a response</td>
<td>Lower latency means faster replies, improving user experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Latent space</strong></td>
<td>The hidden way the model represents data inside it</td>
<td>Helps us understand how the AI processes information.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>LLM (large language model)</strong></td>
<td>A big AI model that understands and generates text</td>
<td>Powers many AI tools, like chatbots and content creators.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Model deployment</strong></td>
<td>Making the model available online</td>
<td>Needed to put AI into real-world use.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Multimodal</strong></td>
<td>Models that handle different data types, like text and images</td>
<td>People use words, pictures, and sounds. When AI can understand all
these, it can help users better. Using multimodal AI makes your tools
more powerful.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Overfitting</strong></td>
<td>When a model learns training data too well but fails on new
data</td>
<td>If the AI is too tuned to old examples, it might not work well on
new stuff. Getting perfect scores on tests might mean it’s overfitting.
You want the AI to handle new things, not just repeat what it
learned.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Pre-training</strong></td>
<td>The model’s initial learning phase on lots of data</td>
<td>It’s like giving the model a big education before it starts specific
jobs. This helps it learn general things, but you might need to adjust
it later for your needs.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Prompt</strong></td>
<td>The input or question you give to the AI</td>
<td>Giving clear and detailed prompts helps the AI understand what you
want. Just like talking to a person, good communication gets better
results.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Prompt engineering</strong></td>
<td>Designing prompts to get the best results</td>
<td>By learning how to write good prompts, you can make the AI give
better answers. It’s like improving your communication skills to get the
best results.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Prompt injection</strong></td>
<td>A security risk where bad instructions are added to prompts</td>
<td>Users might try to trick the AI into ignoring your rules and doing
things you don’t want. Knowing about prompt injection helps you protect
your AI system from misuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Prompt templates</strong></td>
<td>Pre-made formats for prompts to keep inputs consistent</td>
<td>They help you communicate with the AI consistently by filling in
blanks in a set format. This makes it easier to use the AI in different
situations and ensures you get good results.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Rate limiting</strong></td>
<td>Limiting how many requests can be made in a time period</td>
<td>Prevents system overload, keeping services running smoothly.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF)</strong></td>
<td>Training AI using people’s feedback</td>
<td>It helps the AI learn from what people like or don’t like, making
its answers better. But it’s a complex method, and you might not need it
right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Reranking</strong></td>
<td>Sorting results to pick the most important ones</td>
<td>When you have limited space (like a small context window), reranking
helps you choose the most relevant documents to show the AI. This
ensures the best information is used, improving the AI’s answers.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</strong></td>
<td>Providing relevant context to the LLM</td>
<td>A language model needs proper context to answer questions. Like a
person, it needs access to information such as data, past conversations,
or documents to give a good answer. Collecting and giving this info to
the AI before asking it questions helps prevent mistakes or it saying, “I don’t
know.”</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Semantic search</strong></td>
<td>Searching based on meaning, not just words</td>
<td>It lets you search based on meaning, not just exact words, using
embeddings. Combining it with keyword search (hybrid search) gives even
better results.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Temperature</strong></td>
<td>A setting that controls how creative AI responses are</td>
<td>Lets you choose between predictable or more imaginative answers.
Adjusting temperature can affect the quality and usefulness of the AI’s
responses.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Token limits</strong></td>
<td>The max number of words or pieces the model handles</td>
<td>Affects how much information you can input or get back. You need to plan
your AI use within these limits, balancing detail and cost.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Tokenization</strong></td>
<td>Breaking text into small pieces the model understands</td>
<td>It allows the AI to understand the text. Also, you pay for
AI based on the number of tokens used, so knowing about tokens helps
manage costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Top-<em>p</em> sampling</strong></td>
<td>Choosing the next word from top choices making up a set
probability</td>
<td>Balances predictability and creativity in AI responses. The
trade-off is between safe answers and more varied ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Transfer learning</strong></td>
<td>Using knowledge from one task to help with another</td>
<td>You can start with a strong AI model someone else made and adjust it
for your needs. This saves time and keeps the model’s general abilities
while making it better for your tasks.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Transformer</strong></td>
<td>A type of AI model using attention to understand language</td>
<td>They are the main type of model used in generative AI today, like
the ones that power chatbots and language tools.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Vector database</strong></td>
<td>A special database for storing and searching embeddings</td>
<td>They store embeddings of text, images, and more, so you can search
by meaning. This makes finding similar items faster and improves
searches and recommendations.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Zero-shot learning</strong></td>
<td>When the model does a new task without training or examples</td>
<td>This means you don’t give any examples to the AI. While it’s good
for simple tasks, not providing examples might make it harder for the AI
to perform well on complex tasks. Giving examples helps, but takes up
space in the prompt. You need to balance prompt space with the need for
examples.</td>
