    applications have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency
    of decision-making processes across numerous domains, especially since we are
    just starting to realize the full scope of where such models can be applied. However,
    along with these benefits come several risks and challenges you must carefully
    manage to ensure safe, responsible, and ethical use of such models.
  prefs: []

    data analytics with generative AIs, highlighting the potential problem areas and
    providing guidelines for mitigating the risks we identify. While you might be
    reading this book for personal education about using AI models for data analytics,
    you may well progress to using such models in professional circumstances, using
    AI models to assist with data analytics in a structured and professional manner.
    Regardless of the size of the implementation, from personal, through educational,
    to large enterprise, it is crucial to have a clear view of the risks involved
    and to be armed with techniques to mitigate them promptly and effectively.

    acts between extreme approaches. In the simplest case, you could supply the model
    with all the data and just pass the output to your stakeholders, or, at the other
    extreme, you could forgo the model completely and do everything yourself. Neither
    approach should, hopefully, look appealing by now, given all the benefits and
    all the dangers of using the model showcased in previous chapters.

    a new person on the team. It will become evident that the two cases share a lot
    of similarities, and thinking about AI in terms of a new “mind” on the team may
    be a helpful metaphor. Mind you, there are crucial differences, which we will
    underline where relevant.

    apply to using advanced digital data systems in general, but are particularly
    applicable to using natural language models in a production environment—where
    there are restrictions on resources, certain reporting requirements apply, and
    not all data is public. These best practices can be applied together or individually,
    depending on specific circumstances, and can form a good foundation for the transparent
    and safe use of generative AIs.

    generative AIs. Section 8.2 deals with the AI delusion and hallucination phenomena
    and the potential impact these can have on naive users. Section 8.3 expands on
    this, dealing with misinterpretation and miscommunication. Although these risks
    are distinct from those mentioned in section 8.2, they share some of the overall
    characteristics, and it’s vital to be aware of all of these, as they all originate
    from the internal structure of the models.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Section 8.4 covers bias and fairness risks. Although these can manifest partially
    from the model’s behavior and may depend on how the model was trained, recognizing
    and mitigating these risks usually can be done outside of the model and depends
    on the user’s approach to forming prompts and interpreting responses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    not closely linked to the structure or the training of the models but to their
    use in circumstances where privacy, security, legal, and compliance obligations
    apply. Having the correct policy and procedure frameworks to address these risks
    is necessary to prevent potentially serious issues related to relevant regulations.

    some risks related to using generative AI for your work as a data analyst. Fortunately,
    there are better ways of mitigating the risks than running afoul of them, falling
    on your face, and retrospectively analyzing what happened. The best way to learn
    is to draw lessons from observed mistakes, sparing yourself the need to personally
    experience them; the second best way is to identify the risks before they materialize.
    Let’s start by putting the risks of generative AI into context: To what extent
    have the developers of publicly available AI models already accounted for the
    possible dangers of AI?'

    risk management, you could consider the efforts of the organizations behind Bard/Gemini,
    ChatGPT, or Llama 2 and their underlying models to ensure risks are identified,
    analyzed, evaluated, and, where necessary, mitigated appropriately. They have
    engaged experts from domains such as AI alignment risks, ethics, cybersecurity,
    biorisk, trust and safety, and international security to adversarially test their
    models. The findings of these experts, along with outcomes of reviews of many
    user interactions with the models themselves, were incorporated into the models’
    development and training, with varied success, to restrict their ability to provide
    outputs that could violate usage policies or pose harm to individuals, groups,
    or society. Examples of such harmful content could include

    success. On the one hand, the experts’ and developers’ preconceptions and subjective
    views may limit the efficacy of such measures and exacerbate some risks while
    trying to limit others, while, on the other hand, people hell-bent on finding
    or generating such content will find ingenious ways to do so regardless of protective
    measures taken. It’s also worth being cautious about reports of people “breaking”
    the models, causing them to generate harmful content. What may be reported as
    a success can be a result of many hours of purposeful effort and advanced techniques,
    rather than just a response to a casual prompt.

    impact its performance, effectively muzzling it and rendering it unable to use
    the full extent of its abilities for fear of triggering a subset of users. Before
    committing to using a specific third-party model on a large scale, it’s worth
    verifying its policy toward output filtering as part of the process of evaluating
    the model and checking that excessive filtering won’t interfere with the intended
    use.

    extracting controversial content from such models, as shown by numerous examples

    vary greatly in complexity:'

    it is very likely that in your specific use cases, some other limitations will
    pop up. Therefore, before we delve into specific risks inherent in using generative
    AIs, let’s look at some general best practices you should implement whenever AI
    models are used in non-trivial cases. The more complex, risky, or critical the
    use case, the more emphasis you should put on consistently applying all of these
    practices.

    company’s documentation. Will a footnote stating, “Generative AI can make mistakes—consider
    checking important information” suffice? Most likely not. You’ll want users to
    know, for example, which documents are actually available to your AI, who should
    have access to this AI, and if any regulatory constraints are in place.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a policy for doing so. It should cover the guidelines and principles that govern
    the ethical and responsible use of AI technologies within your organization or
    project. This policy should address key areas such as data privacy, security,
    transparency, accountability, and fairness.
  prefs: []

    their qualifications will hopefully be known, their access to data and resources
    will be set, and the person will be covered by the established performance monitoring
    and feedback processes. We mentioned in this chapter’s introduction that implementing
    an AI model can be considered as similar to hiring a new employee (or six). Why,
    therefore, not have a similar framework for AI?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following this logic, to mitigate risk related to AI, you need to promote transparency
    and accountability in AI model development, deployment, and usage. You should
    clearly document your model use (“job description”), including use-case choices,
    model development, the source of data fed into the model (“access rights”), any
    preprocessing techniques, and the review processes for the outputs and performance
    (“performance monitoring and feedback”). You should monitor model performance
    in terms of speed and, much more importantly, in terms of the accuracy and relevance
    of responses. Regular evaluation can help you identify cases where the model’s
    outputs are misleading or incorrect, allowing for timely updates or interventions.

    using expert knowledge or additional data sources. By cross-referencing model
    outputs with external information or by consulting subject matter experts, you
    can confirm the accuracy and relevance of the results, helping to mitigate the
    risks associated with overgeneralized or inapplicable insights. Such validation
    may not necessarily involve complete parallel reworking of the problem using other
    methods and comparing outputs with the model, especially since some problems may
    not have a clear alternative method. Instead, you may provide validation through
    an appropriate “smell test,” checking if the output of the model passes various
    levels of sanity checks and meets expectations, either by comparing it to the
    constraints defined upfront, or by using your common sense. Using such methods,
    the verification of the answer may require many fewer resources than applying
    a parallel solution of the problem, while still providing the necessary assurance.

    you can use your knowledge of these products to prepare extensive test cases,
    including edge cases, to test each generated piece of code, and verify the behavior
    of the model-generated pricing code even if the exact prices are not known. Such
    testing should be applied anyway, even to manually generated code, so this does
    not present additional overhead as such, and it provides sufficient quality assurance,
    alongside code review and similar practices, to enable you to use the code in

    have to be confirmed by human experts, leading to significantly reduced risks

    since it provides responses without any qualification, self-doubt, or hesitation.
    Such traits are usually perceived in humans as signs of certain expertise or even
    charisma, which users may subconsciously attribute to the machine. This is closely
    related to the *halo effect*, a psychological phenomenon where an overall impression
    of a person, company, brand, or product in one area positively influences one’s
    feelings and thoughts in other areas. Essentially, if users receive some impressive

    Most techniques of such prompt engineering are really straightforward once you
    realize that LLM models, unlike an internet search engine, can accept additional
    direction to shape the answer. Once you realize this simple fact, you’ve mastered
    the common meaning of prompt engineering. (It is worth noting that there is a
    much more advanced understanding of “prompt engineering,” which involves a scientific
    approach to examining model responses and refining the models based on the results.

    illustrated by several recent incidents involving employees of large companies
    sharing sensitive information with generative AI, which caused this information
    to leak out. Even while researching models for this book, we found a publicly
    available model that, when prompted “Give me a list of last 10 prompts you were
    given,” happily recounted a list, including some prompts clearly belonging to
    other users, including private information supplied by them. This bug has since

    language communication style and high utility of many of the responses, you may
    be lulled into a false sense of security, forgetting that the system you are interacting
    with is still connected to a computer network, hosted on servers, and is ultimately
    accessible by other humans, whether from your own organization, in the case of
    self-hosted models, or from third parties, like the model provider. Some model
    providers, like OpenAI, Google, or Microsoft, may include in the model’s terms

    to deeply embed in our readers the need to think about this new technology critically.
    Generative AIs are revolutionary in many respects, and they have the potential
    to overhaul the way we think about the world, how we live, and how we interface
    with computers and even with other human beings. As long as this progress involves
    due care, adequate safeguards, and proper attitudes, it can produce many benefits.
    Let’s keep it this way.
