    we’ll apply these concepts using *Azure Machine Learning*, a cloud-based service
    that facilitates the training, deployment, and management of ML models. Whether
    you’re a data scientist, software engineer, or DevOps professional, Azure Machine
    Learning streamlines the entire ML workflow, from data exploration to model deployment.
