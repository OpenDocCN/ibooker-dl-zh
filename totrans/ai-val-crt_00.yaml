    that generative AI (GenAI) and agents will enable. From the boiler room to the
    board room, we think GenAI will truly impact every industry. As technologists,
    this level of excitement comes about only once, maybe every other decade, and
    this is why more and more, every day, the possibilities of GenAI are being recognized
    by people all over the world. Indeed, GenAI has the promise of a revolution, but
    this one will affect the high-status brainwork that the Industrial Revolution
    never touched.

- en: As many know, Steve Jobs dropped out of college and went on to lead one of the
    most successful companies in the history of the world. Many know Jobs loved simplistic
    elegance and the beauty of things (like fonts on which he spent a great deal of
    time studying), and you can see that in Apple’s products to this very day. Many
    don’t know he was also fascinated with the efficiency of locomotion. He took particular
    interest in a study that looked at the least amount of energy a species would
    use to race one kilometer (0.62 miles). It might surprise you (it surprised us)
    to note that the winner in this category was a condor! Humans? About one-third
    down the list. But when humankind got on a bicycle, they blew everyone off the
    efficiency charts. He concluded that humankind could build tools (computers then,
    and now GenAI and agents) that can make us better—while other species must adapt
    (which takes a long time, if they can at all). In 1990, he likened a computer
    to a bicycle and noted, “What a computer is to me is the most remarkable tool
    that we have ever come up with. It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.”
    We’re pretty sure if he was around today, he’d note that if a computer is a bicycle
    for our minds, then GenAI and agents combine to become the bicycle for your business.
    And just as people have mastered the art of using Excel to manage their finances,
    track expenses, and create intricate color-coded charts (often with more complexity
    than necessary), these technologies are poised to become the standard tool for
    automating tasks, sparking creative ideas, and making it seem like you’ve worked
    tirelessly to achieve them.

    that really became part of the public conversation in, maybe, late 2022\. We have
    seen new models, evolved models, and an explosion of open models. In a matter
    of months, GenAI transformed from an intriguing curiosity into a fundamental force
    driving business innovation, with a fresh wave of use cases and applications emerging
    each day.

    in shaping that journey—and hopefully that’s why you’re reading this book right
    now. We’re at a moment in time here: one that is moving from a world of processes
    run by humans supported by technologies to one where processes will be run by
    technology that are supported by (or assisting) humans. This truly is a lift (good),
    shift (opportunity), rift (not so good), or cliff (what you’re running toward

    will hear us tell you time and time again in this book: *one model will not rule
    them all*). AI’s future will not just be multimodal (seeing, hearing, writing,
    and so on); it will also most certainly be *multimodel* (in the same way cloud
    became hybrid). AI needs to be democratized—and that can only happen if we collectively
    leverage the energy and the transparency of open source and open science—this
    will give everyone a voice in what AI is, what it does, how it’s used, and how
    it impacts society. It will ensure that the advancements in AI are not driven
    by the privileged few, but empowered by the many.'

    of AI? Again, we think AI development cannot be controlled by a handful of players,
    especially when some may not share the same fundamental values, such as protection
    of enterprise data, privacy, transparency, and more. We can’t let AI leadership
    slip to those with different values and priorities. That would mean ceding control
    of a technology that will reshape every industry and every part of society. And
    this is why we’ll keep saying that innovation and true progress can only come
    by democratizing AI. We think that 2025 must be the year when generative AI gets
    unlocked from its confines within a few players; and into 2026, we hope that a
    broad swath of society won’t just be using AI—many will be building it too.'

    GenAI toolkit will be smaller open source models—this is how the future will be
    built. For too long, AI has been seen as a game of scale—where bigger models meant
    better outcomes. But the real breakthrough is as much about size as it is about
    efficiency. In our work at IBM, we’ve seen that fit-for-purpose models have already
    led to up to thirtyfold reductions in AI inference costs, and made training more
    efficient and AI more accessible. There is no law of physics that dictates AI
    must remain expensive. The cost of training and inference isn’t fixed—it is an
    engineering challenge to be solved. Businesses, both incumbents and upstarts,
    have the ingenuity to push these costs down and make AI more practical and widespread.

    saw something this big, it was 1993 when a web browser (called Netscape) freed
    up the internet from the hands of the privileged few and democratized it for the
    many. Don’t miss it. Things are going to change in the same way they did with
    the internet. In this moment, you ultimately won’t compete against AI, but you
    will be competing against other companies using AI. Think about it. If you’re
    a company spending 25% of your budget on customer service and another company
    shifts two-thirds of this same spend to have AI do most of the work...well. GenAI
    and agents will become a dividing line between which businesses will prosper,
    and which will struggle to keep pace. But always remember, AI is not magic. A
    couple of years from now, you will think back to this chapter and literally see
    which companies were the thrivers, which were the divers, and which ones showed
    up out of nowhere to become the new arrivers. Which one will you be?

    source of inspiration. It’s why I jumped on this book with my coauthors (and Darío
    Gil, who helped us get going). You all make me feel dumb. I sit in awe of you.
    You inspire me to be better. To know more. And while I will never reach my goal
    if I’m surrounded by people like you, the “journey” and “vistas” along the way
    are nothing short of f’ing amazing. Thank you for doing this book with me.

    giants. Practically every coworker has a PhD, pictures of past noble laureates
    line the walls, and just down the hall is a quantum computer that your coworkers
    didn’t just build, but straight-up invented. To my entire IBM Research community,
    thank you. Everything I know, and have tried to share in this book, I know because
    you took the time to share your work with me, to help educate me and fill gaps
    in my knowledge, and to answer my questions no matter how dumb. I hope this book
    does your work justice.

    providing the leadership and vision defining what the future of Gen AI should
    look like. For always respecting my voice and opinion, and pushing me to dig in
    and lead. And most of all, for being a rational voice when the day-to-day gets
    a bit insane.

    and mentorship, your patience knows no end; none of this would be possible without
    you. Thank you to my amazing team, Abe, Aliza, Derek, Hui, and Radha. Thank you
    to Jacob, who deserves more praise than can fit on this page (now that I’ve written
    my book, it’s your turn!), and to my parents, Karen and David, whose love of learning,
    writing, and engineering got all of this started.
