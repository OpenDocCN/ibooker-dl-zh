    and deployment strategies, from building Docker images to setting up continuous
    integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with tools like GitHub
    Actions. It also emphasizes secure application development, discussing threat
    modeling and the implementation of security best practices. Additionally, this
    part of the book explores the concept of democratizing access to AI by hosting
