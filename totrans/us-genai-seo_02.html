<h1><span class="label">Chapter 1. </span>SEO in the Age of Generative AI</h1>

<p>The age of artificial intelligence is upon us. AI will have broad, sweeping implications that will affect nearly every aspect of our lives, including how users search for what they need online. Therefore, we must adapt how we perform search engine optimization (SEO) to get our brands in front of users. In this book, we’ll look beyond the hype and myths, instead focusing on the generative AI tools that exist today and how they can be used to substantially enhance your SEO program.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we’ll discuss why organic search remains one of the most valuable marketing channels at your disposal, why SEO is the key to optimizing the volume of traffic you get from that channel, and why generative AI tools won’t cause that to change. You’ll learn how the Google algorithm really works by taking a deep dive into <a href="https://oreil.ly/0zo-N">Google’s 2023 testimony to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ)</a> and the <a href="https://oreil.ly/oGoa8">Google Content Warehouse API leak</a>, which became widely known in May 2024.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that some of what we say in this chapter will differ from commonly held beliefs about how SEO works. Keep an open mind. This information will come in handy if you’re responsible for obtaining resources or budgets to execute SEO programs. It may help you educate and gain support from those who hold fast to outdated beliefs. Having a sound understanding of core parts of the Google algorithm will also better equip you to use generative AI as a tool to enhance your SEO efforts.</p>

<p>Here is what we’ll cover in this chapter:</p>

These changes can take many forms, such as implementing a new ecommerce platform, changing JavaScript frameworks, implementing SEO tags (e.g., <code>rel=canonical</code>, <code>noindex</code>, <code>nofollow</code>, and <code>hreflang</code>), and ensuring that your website is easily crawled. The main purpose of technical SEO is to ensure that search engine robots can crawl and understand the content of your web pages.</p>

<p>Now that we have a common language, let’s talk about SEO and its role in the success of your organization.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Why Does SEO Matter?"><div class="sect1" id="ch01_why_does_seo_matter_1748358209375842">
<h1>Why Does SEO Matter?</h1>

<p>There are<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SEO (search engine optimization)" data-secondary="value of" id="seo-value"/> several key reasons why SEO can be so valuable to your organization:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Organic search is one of the largest sources of traffic to most websites.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>SEO offers one of the highest conversion rates among digital marketing channels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The return on investment (ROI) potential of SEO is one of the highest among digital marketing channels.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s explore these three reasons in detail.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="High Traffic Potential"><div class="sect2" id="ch01_high_traffic_potential_1748358209375903">
<h2>High Traffic Potential</h2>

<p>Organic search <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="organic search" data-secondary="traffic potential" id="organic-search-traffic"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="traffic from organic search" id="traffic-organic-search"/>remains one of the highest sources of traffic to most of the world’s websites. But why is the potential for traffic so high? Simply because there are so many searches on Google: <a href="https://oreil.ly/Z3LYm">8.5 billion per day</a>, or 99,000 queries per second. In addition, 53% of all clicks come from organic search, according to <a href="https://oreil.ly/gWo73">research</a> performed by BrightEdge Research in 2020 (see <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_1_1748358209361061">Figure 1-1</a>). More recently, <a href="https://oreil.ly/imesf">studies</a> have suggested that the advent of AI Overviews has lowered SEO traffic potential by 35%, but even with this reduction SEO remains a highly valuable channel. Therefore, SEO to put yourself ahead of your competitors on the search results page is of critical importance to your organization.</p>

<figure><div id="ch01_figure_1_1748358209361061" class="figure"><img src="assets/ugai_0101.png" width="824" height="512"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 1-1. </span>The highest percentage of clicks (53%) are from organic search (data source: <a href="https://oreil.ly/gWo73">Brightedge Research, “Organic Channel Share Expands to 53.3% of Traffic,” 2019</a>)</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>You can also see in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_1_1748358209361061">Figure 1-1</a> that SEO provides 10 times more traffic than <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="social media" data-secondary="traffic potential" id="id303"/>organic social media. Note that this percentage is calculated over the lifetime of the content; for organizations with a strong social media presence, social media may provide a larger share of traffic at the time of the content’s initial publication.</p>

<p>There has<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="generative AI" data-secondary="search engine demand and" id="id304"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="search engines" data-secondary="demand versus generative AI" id="id305"/> been a lot of speculation that generative AI tools will dramatically reduce the demand for traditional search engines, but this is extremely unlikely. In fact, <a href="https://oreil.ly/GeEoZ">data published by Rand Fishkin of SparkToro in March 2025</a> shows that Google still has a 93.57% market share. Generative AI will have some impact, but its propensity to make errors will hold it back from replacing search. In addition, there are classes of queries that aren’t great fits for generative AI, such as when a user isn’t likely to be satisfied by a mostly accurate, mostly complete text response. A few examples include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>A user has a medical condition, so they are going to do extensive research and will want answers they know are both 100% accurate and complete.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A user needs to obtain comprehensive knowledge of a topic, so they are going to want to perform detailed research. Examples of this include understanding the steps in building a bridge or learning Python well enough to execute complex programming tasks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A user wants assistance in preparing for a career certification test (such as the Praxis teacher’s exam).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A user has an immediate real-time need, such as locating a nearby business (e.g., local search queries like “pizza near me”).</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/PR6xo">Gartner</a> forecast a reduction of search engine demand of 25% by 2026. This would be a material—but not dramatic—reduction. Search demand will remain highly relevant to your <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="organic search" data-secondary="traffic potential" data-startref="organic-search-traffic" id="id306"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="traffic from organic search" data-startref="traffic-organic-search" id="id307"/>organization.</p>

<h2>High Conversion Rates</h2>

<p>Another <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="organic search" data-secondary="conversion rates" id="id308"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="conversion rates" id="id309"/>reason that organic search traffic is so valuable is that it has a high conversion rate. <a href="https://oreil.ly/6q7Tg">Data from Sage Consulting</a>, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_2_1748358209361101">Figure 1-2</a>, demonstrates the conversion rate across many different channels, and SEO is among the best.</p>

</div></figure>

<p>SEO conversion rates tend to be high because users who enter a search query have a purpose. They want something, be that to get information, complete a task, or research or buy a product or service. When they click on a search result, that implies they believe the result fits their needs.</p>

<p>Once the user enters your site, you have a motivated customer, which will potentially result in a desired action for your organization, such as a purchase, a sign-up for a newsletter, and so on. Even if all they want is information, they will still associate some value with your organization and website if you’re the one to provide them with what they’re looking for.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="High ROI"><div class="sect2" id="ch01_high_roi_1748358209376021">
<h2>High ROI</h2>

<p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="organic search" data-secondary="ROI" id="organic-search-roi"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ROI (return on investment)" data-secondary="of organic search" data-secondary-sortas="organic search" id="roi-organic-search"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="return on investment" data-see="ROI" id="id310"/> high conversion rate of SEO is a large factor in why SEO can lead to very high ROI. SEO ROI can be difficult to measure due to the delay in the time from when you implement technical or content SEO and when you see the benefits. This often takes three to six months. Note that conversion rates will vary significantly depending on the products or services offered by the site.</p>

<p>For that reason, there is little data on SEO ROI. Some agencies have published their own assessments of ROI, though. For example, <a href="https://oreil.ly/q06Vg">Terakeet</a> reports that SEO ROI ranges between 5x and 12.2x, and <a href="https://oreil.ly/AnWat">Profitworks</a> reported an SEO ROI of 2.75x. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_3_1748358209361126">Figure 1-3</a> shows the results of a <a href="https://oreil.ly/11aJ9"><em>Search Engine Journal</em> survey of digital marketers</a> finding that 49% consider SEO to be the highest ROI channel.</p>

<figure><div id="ch01_figure_3_1748358209361126" class="figure"><img src="assets/ugai_0103.png" width="977" height="431"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 1-3. </span>Highest ROI channels (data source: <a href="https://oreil.ly/6q7Tg">Search Engine Journal, “Which Digital Marketing Channel Has the Highest ROI for Your Website?” 2018</a>)</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Another reason <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="direct response models" id="id311"/>that SEO ROI is high is there is no cost per action, or “sales cost.” For example, with pay-per-click (PPC) models, you pay for each click on your ad. Similarly, with display advertising, you pay for your ad placement (per impression, per click, or per action). As a result, there is a direct cost associated with each sale you make from your advertising, which you pay to third parties for your ad placements. That said, the advantage of these models is that they are “direct response” models, meaning that for every dollar you spend you can expect to receive some money back in the short term. The predictability of these models is high, and they can usually be tuned to drive revenue at a known level of ROI. The downside with direct response models, though, is that the competition for ad placements is very high because of how direct and immediate the response is, which drives prices up and causes ROI to be comparatively low.</p>

<p>SEO isn’t a direct response model. When you invest in SEO, it may take three to six months to see results, and the scale of the results is difficult to forecast. In addition, no money is paid to third parties: with SEO, your content that ranks high in Google search results has earned that placement, and you did not have to pay Google for your presence there.</p>

<p>There is a cost to SEO, of course, which is the amount of money you invest in the team you have that works on SEO on your behalf as well as others who collaborate with the SEO team (such as development and writing teams). But because there is less certainty of the rankings and traffic you might get as a result of your investment in SEO, many senior managers are reluctant to make the investment, or they limit the size of that investment. This frequently leads to their not taking advantage of many opportunities to grow their organic search traffic. (Note: if you use generative AI to assist in your SEO efforts, the cost of those efforts will be less and will lower the risk associated with the investment. Hence the reason for this book!) This opens the door for more aggressive organizations to make those investments and take advantage of those opportunities. As a result, they can gain access to higher ROI conversions.</p>

<p>As you can see, optimizing your organization’s websites so that they appear when potential customers have the most incentive to visit them can be exceptionally valuable. As such, it pays to understand how search engine algorithms work so that you can optimize your <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SEO (search engine optimization)" data-secondary="value of" data-startref="seo-value" id="id312"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="organic search" data-secondary="ROI" data-startref="organic-search-roi" id="id313"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ROI (return on investment)" data-secondary="of organic search" data-secondary-sortas="organic search" data-startref="roi-organic-search" id="id314"/>SEO strategy.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="The Google Algorithm"><div class="sect1" id="ch01_the_google_algorithm_1748358209376078">
<h1>The Google Algorithm</h1>

<p>In May 2024, an<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Google algorithm" data-secondary="user interactions and" id="google-algorithm-user-interaction"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="user interactions, Google algorithm and" id="user-interaction-google-algorithm"/> anonymous source made Rand Fishkin aware of <a href="https://oreil.ly/oGoa8">documents leaked from Google</a> that provided detailed information on more than 2,500 pages of API information, including names of modules and more than 10,000 parameters that Google uses in its algorithms. This extraordinary information helped clarify how Google is able to measure many aspects of websites, including the quality of the content on those sites.</p>

<p>What has attracted less attention from SEO professionals is the wealth of information related to how the Google algorithm works in Google’s testimony to the US DOJ in 2023. Of particular interest was an <a href="https://oreil.ly/G1E43">internal presentation</a> given by Google to the DOJ. This slide deck specifically outlines aspects of how the Google algorithm works. Figures <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="#ch01_figure_4_1748358209361150">1-4</a> through <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="#ch01_figure_8_1748358209361235">1-8</a> are slides from that presentation, which was released to the public by the US DOJ. You should review these slides in detail as they illustrate key concepts of Google’s algorithm that are important to your SEO optimization efforts.</p>

</div></figure>

<p>As you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_4_1748358209361150">Figure 1-4</a>, Google indicates that <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ranking" data-secondary="in Google algorithm" data-secondary-sortas="Google algorithm" id="id315"/>ranking is broken into three broad concepts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>“What the document says about itself” relates to the nature of the content itself. This is where the words and phrases used in a piece of content establish its relevance. Title tags, heading tags, bolding, italics, and font size all play a role in highlighting the parts of the content that are the most important.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>“What the Web says about the document” refers to the role of links in ranking, so these are still an important ranking factor.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>“What users say about the document” is a measure of user engagement with the document, where higher levels of engagement imply that the document is of higher quality.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Also take note of the text at the bottom of the slide. Here the presentation indicates that user interactions tracked include clicks, attention on a result, swipes on carousels, and entering a new query.</p>

<p>The “user interaction signals” slide, shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_5_1748358209361172">Figure 1-5</a>, clearly establishes the concept that data on user interactions on a page that receives traffic from a Google search is fed back to Google and this can influence future search results. The interactions specified on this slide include read, clicks, scrolls, and mouse hovers. Between Figures <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="#ch01_figure_4_1748358209361150">1-4</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="#ch01_figure_5_1748358209361172">1-5</a> you can see that Google is interested in many aspects of user interactions.</p>

<p>The slide shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_6_1748358209361193">Figure 1-6</a> is arguably one of the most interesting slides of them all because of its title: “We do not understand documents. We fake it.” Then Google clarifies that it watches how people react to documents and collects and stores data on that. What this makes clear to us is that Google places a great deal of weight on these user-interaction signals.</p>

<p>The slide shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_7_1748358209361215">Figure 1-7</a> helps clarify that this data is fed back into the system and used to benefit future users.</p>

<p>Finally, the slide shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_8_1748358209361235">Figure 1-8</a> closes the loop and establishes that the user-interaction data is used to improve search results, which is how it benefits future users.

<p class="pagebreak-before">Google VP of Search Pandurang Nayak also <a href="https://oreil.ly/lyYES">testified to the DOJ</a> about how the Google algorithm works. In this testimony, he made many fascinating observations, including these two:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Google has been tracking user-interaction data since 2005, possibly even earlier, and using that data as a key part of its ranking algorithms.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Google’s primary goal in launching the Chrome browser in 2008 was to collect even more user-interaction data.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Last but not least, we have the information contained within the <a href="https://oreil.ly/fixv1">Google API leak documents</a>. Parsing through these documents is not for the faint of heart because there are more than 2,400 of them. In short, what these documents allow us to see is that Google has large numbers of parameters related to user interaction. This includes more than 30 variables related to clicks as well as variables related to hovers, scrolls, and a lot more.</p>

<p>In summary, Google leverages interactions with its search results and data from Chrome to help understand which web pages best address which search queries and which content is the highest quality. This includes studying click patterns and other aspects of the behavior of users on your website.

<h1>What You Need to Know About What Google Wants</h1>

<p>In this<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SEO (search engine optimization)" data-secondary="content SEO" data-tertiary="Google algorithm and" id="seo-content-google-algorithm"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content SEO" data-secondary="Google algorithm and" id="content-seo-google-algorithm"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Google algorithm" data-secondary="content SEO and" id="google-algorithm-content-seo"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="organic search" data-secondary="content SEO and" id="organic-search-content-seo"/> section, we’ll discuss what type of content the Google algorithm is designed to find and rank. Our discussion will include the highly valuable information that we learned from the Google API leak. We’ll discuss that from the perspective of what you need to do to get your content to rank higher in Google Search.</p>

<p>Earning organic search traffic happens after you have accomplished these three things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Ensured that search engines (primarily Google in the great majority of countries) can read and process your website. This is accomplished by a well-thought-out approach to the technology used in building your site.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Published great content that does an excellent job of helping users on your website. One of the principal ways that Google measures the quality of your web pages and website is by measuring user interactions that take place on the site to see if users are having a good experience.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Earned<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="links" data-secondary="in Google algorithm" data-secondary-sortas="Google algorithm" id="id318"/> a level of reputation and visibility in the market that suggests that your content is in demand (causing Google to want to rank it). Google evaluates links to your site from other websites to measure this. In addition, traffic from other sources, including social media sites, emails, browser bookmarks, and type-in traffic, are all indications that your site has a strong reputation.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>The more relevant and valuable the links are to the visitors of the web page containing the link, the better. If users are clicking on the links and coming to your site, the links have much more SEO value to you.</p>
</div>

<p>There are also sites that can detract from your brand. If you publish on third-party sites that have a lot of low-quality content, that won’t reflect well on your brand. This is data that Google can track using Chrome.</p>

<p>For decades, <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="spam in search results" id="id319"/>many SEO professionals focused on finding ways to manipulate Google’s rankings to their advantage. While most SEO professionals tried to play by the rules, those who didn’t created enough problems that Google has had to invest significant resources to uncover their tactics. In response, Google has created many algorithms intended to fight spam in the search results. Google also maintains a large team of “web spam” professionals who can evaluate potential problem sites and assign manual ranking penalties.</p>

<p>The reason this matters to Google is because the success of its search engine ultimately depends on its ability to deliver the best possible results to users. User satisfaction with the search results drives higher levels of usage and helps Google preserve its market share. This has resulted in extremely high satisfaction rates with Google. In 2024, this figure was at 81% according to a <a href="https://oreil.ly/1Z1vd">survey in <em>Search Engine Land</em></a>.</p>

<p>Google accomplishes this with the quality of its search results. This depends on many factors, but the goals of all of Google’s efforts are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Understand the user’s intent with a query</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Discover great content on all topics across the web</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Match up great content relevant to a user’s query and deliver that to the user in the search results</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This leads to the core of what Google wants from websites: high-quality content combined with a great UX. We can see confirmation of that in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_9_1748358209361255">Figure 1-9</a> showing tweets from Google spokespeople since 2018.</p>

<h2>High-Quality Content Is Critical to SEO Success</h2>

<p>What <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content SEO" data-secondary="quality of content" id="id320"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="quality of content" id="id321"/>this all means is that the best strategies for your SEO program center on creating great content designed to help users with their wants and needs. As you delve into how to use AI to grow your SEO program later in this book, you will learn how AI can assist with creating that great content.</p>

<p>The following are some key ways you can influence the quality of your content:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The subject matter expertise of the author and the level of scrutiny in the review and feedback process</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The author’s level of direct experience with the content</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Whether the content brings unique new expertise or perspectives on the topic</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Doing this well requires a deep commitment to understanding user needs related to your business and finding ways to meet those needs better than the websites that compete with yours. <a href="https://oreil.ly/la0Ah">Google has a page</a> <span class="keep-together">dedicated</span> to outlining how it suggests content creators meet these goals. Google also considers two other factors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Whether your site is considered authoritative on the topic</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If users trust your organization and website in your chosen subject area</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
	<p>Analysis performed by the authors of the algorithms used by generative AI tool providers shows that they likewise have an interest in very high quality content. As a result, any investment you make in such content will potentially assist you with ranking in SEO, ChatGPT Search, and other LLM-based search tools.</p>

It’s also likely that Google looks at this in an aggregated form to understand the strength of your brand. Based on this alone, it’s already clear that you need to treat UX as an important SEO ranking factor.</p>

<p>We saw in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_9_1748358209361255">Figure 1-9</a> that Google regularly tells webmasters that they need to publish high-quality content. Google has communicated this need to create a high-quality UX in a variety of ways, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>EEAT</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Core web vitals</p>
	</li>
	<li>

	<p>Need for secure websites (HTTPS)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Detection and flagging of hacked websites</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll explore these next.</p>

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="EEAT"><div class="sect3" id="ch01_eeat_1748358209376319">
<h3>EEAT</h3>

<p>We <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="EEAT (experience, expertise, authoritativeness, trustworthiness)" data-secondary="Google algorithm and" id="id322"/>introduced the concept of experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trust in the beginning of this chapter. These are guidelines that Google has offered to website publishers to help them evaluate the likelihood that they are creating content of value to users. Google can’t measure EEAT directly but looks at a variety of other signals to measure the quality of your content. This includes directly measuring the behavior of users on your site to determine if they seem to be finding what they were looking for based on factors such as how long they spend on your site, whether they return to your site, how many appear to have a good versus a bad experience, and more.</p>

<p>Per the API leak, Google appears to also track <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="authors of documents, Google algorithm and" id="id323"/>authors of documents, so there may be some signal related to the typical engagement that content from that author gets. In March 2025, Google’s John Mueller confirmed that Google does track these types of signals for what<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) pages" id="id324"/> Google calls “Your Money or Your Life (YMYL)” pages: pages related to health or finances. However, he also said that they don’t keep track of this information for sites that aren’t focused on YMYL topics. In addition, a detailed examination of the <a href="https://oreil.ly/fixv1">documents</a> contained in the 2024 Google API leak provides no evidence that Google actually tracks “experience,” “expertise,” “authoritativeness,” and “trustworthiness” other than the author. Based on this, it seems likely that most of what goes into evaluating content quality is based on actual user engagement with the content.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Core web vitals"><div class="sect3" id="ch01_core_web_vitals_1748358209376371">
<h3>Core web vitals</h3>

<p>In 2020, <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="core web vitals, in Google algorithm" id="core-web-vitals"/>Google introduced the concept of <em>c</em><em>ore </em><em>w</em><em>eb </em><em>v</em><em>itals</em>: a set of signals related to the performance of rendering a web page. These initially included:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Largest<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="largest contentful paint (LCP)" id="id325"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="LCP (largest contentful paint)" id="id326"/> contentful paint (LCP)</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Measures how long it takes to see a substantial portion of the content requested</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>First <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="first input delay (FID)" id="id327"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="FID (first input delay)" id="id328"/>input delay (FID)</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Measures responsiveness to user input</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Cumulative <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cumulative layout shift (CLS)" id="id329"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="CLS (cumulative layout shift)" id="id330"/>layout shift (CLS)</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Measures how stable the web page is while it’s rendering</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>In 2024, Google replaced FID with <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="interaction to next paint (INP)" id="id331"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="INP (interaction to next paint)" id="id332"/>interaction to next paint (INP), which also measures responsiveness of the user interface. Google made the switch to INP because it believes that INP provides a better measure of the page load time’s impact on the quality of the UX on the page.</p>

<p>Data from the Google API leak shows that Google actively tracks these signals within its ranking systems. However, it is not known how much weight is placed on these signals. In addition, if your web pages are materially slower than that of your competitors, you might see lower user engagement signals than your competitors<!--<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="core web vitals, in Google algorithm" data-startref="core-web-vitals">&nbsp;</a>--> do, and this is likely to be the most important reason for you to ensure that your pages load quickly.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect3" class="pagebreak-before less_space" data-pdf-bookmark="Interstitial penalties, HTTPS, and hacked websites"><div class="sect3" id="ch01_interstitial_penalties_https_and_hacked_websites_1748358209376424">
<h3>Interstitial penalties, HTTPS, and hacked websites</h3>

<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/uTgL7">Google</a> has announced three other signals that are related to the UX on a <span class="keep-together">website:</span></p>

<dl>
	<dt>Interstitial penalties</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>If <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="interstitial penalties, in Google algorithm" id="id333"/>Google detects an interstitial that loads on initial page load on top of the content that the user is looking for, that can provide a negative ranking boost on that page.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Secure websites (HTTPS)</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>In 2014, <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="HTTPS, in Google algorithm" id="id334"/>Google made a big push to get website publishers to implement HTTPS encryption on their websites. While this is a standard today, it wasn’t at the time. Using HTTPS provides greater assurance that the user will get the actual content they requested, as opposed to something that has been altered during the process of traveling from your web server to their browser (for more on this, search “man-in-the-middle attacks”).</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Hacked websites</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Google will also <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="hacked websites, in Google algorithm" id="id335"/>flag web sites that have been hacked. These sites can be blocked in Google Search and Chrome. The main reason for doing this is to protect users from bad experiences.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>These UX signals are in addition to what we discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_the_google_algorithm_1748358209376078">“The Google Algorithm”</a>. It should be clear that user engagement is a large ranking factor—possibly the second largest ranking signal, trailing only the relevance of the content to the<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content SEO" data-secondary="UX (user experience) and" data-startref="content-seo-user-experience" id="id336"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="UX (user experience), components of" data-startref="user-experience-components" id="id337"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="user experience (UX), components of" data-startref="user-exp-component" id="id338"/> user’s query.</p>

<h2>Google’s Algorithm Has Limitations</h2>

<p>There are <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Google algorithm" data-secondary="limitations of" id="google-algorithm-limits"/>some limitations to Google’s ability to process a web page. Issues that you need to be aware of include the following:</p>

<h2>JavaScript, Ecommerce Platforms, and CMS</h2>

<p class="pagebreak-after">Each development environment brings a great deal of value to website development. They make websites far easier to build, modify, and support. However, each of these systems comes with limitations. While they provide structures that simplify the development process, those structures can potentially cause problems. Let’s look at each of these in a bit more detail:</p>

<dl class="less_space">
	<dt class="less_space">JavaScript frameworks and static site generators (SSGs)</dt>

	<p>As of <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="JavaScript frameworks, in Google algorithm" id="id344"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SSGs (static site generators), in Google algorithm" id="id345"/>2025, <a href="https://oreil.ly/4NDGd">98.8% of websites use some level of JavaScript</a>, which often comes in the form of JavaScript frameworks or SSGs. They can make it difficult to crawl the site, cause the site to be very slow, make it harder to implement custom title tags, and more. Properly addressing these concerns requires that you perform detailed research on the limitations of whichever platform you choose and then have your dev team make the changes required to address the limitations.</p>

Just as with JavaScript, these platforms all come with their own limitations. Even a simple CMS like WordPress requires that you use a plug-in to help set it up for SEO. Popular plug-ins like the Yoast SEO plug-in make it easy to edit post title tags and meta descriptions and to add SEO tags. Without such plug-ins, these things can’t be done. On the ecommerce platform, issues also need to be addressed. For example, Shopify requires <a href="https://oreil.ly/QPrN9">a plug-in to optimize for SEO</a>, and Magento optimization requires that you install plug-ins such as Amasty or Mageworx.</p>

<p>In addition to issues with development environments, there are many ways Google has asked website owners to provide more information about their sites:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Structured data</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Google <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="structured data, in Google algorithm" id="id349"/>suggests that site owners implement structured data to help it better understand the content. <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>, an initiative introduced by Google, Bing, and Yahoo! in 2011, is the standard for structured data. In return for implementing this schema on your site, search engines can show your page in the search results with enhanced formatting. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_11_1748358209361307">Figure 1-11</a> shows an example of an enhanced search result that is the result of implementing schema.</p>

	<p>These <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="core web vitals, in Google algorithm" id="id353"/>relate to the performance of your site. Google looks at three major metrics: LCP measures how quickly the main content of your page loads; INP measures how quickly your web servers are able to visibly respond to user requests; and CLS measures how much the layout of your page jumps around during rendering of the page.</p>

	<p>The developers within your organization generally try to do the right thing whenever they’re working on a project on your website. But like anyone else, they are under pressure to meet deadlines, and they probably don’t know SEO that well, if at all. This means mistakes can often happen during development. You need to have the right processes in place to ensure that each of your website updates are reviewed for SEO before they are launched.</p>

<h1>What You Need to Know About Content SEO</h1>

<p>Technical SEO <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SEO (search engine optimization)" data-secondary="content SEO" data-tertiary="factors in" id="seo-content-factors"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content SEO" data-secondary="factors in" id="content-seo-factors"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="organic search" data-secondary="content SEO and" id="organic-search-content-seo-factors"/>plays a key role in helping Google discover your content and index it. Certain other factors, such as structured data and page speed, also help Google decide how to value the content you publish. That said, for the most part technical SEO work is about enabling your site to compete for SEO rankings, but ultimately, it’s the content you create that Google will decide to rank.</p>

<p>As we noted previously, Google wants to rank content that does the best job of helping users. There are two major components that make <em>content SEO</em>—the practice of optimizing your content to help it rank well—work:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Helping Google understand what your content is about</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Creating or optimizing content so that it does a great job of addressing user needs</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Correspondingly, content SEO comprises these factors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Ensuring that the content you create uses titles, headings, a readily understandable page structure, and keywords to help search engines establish the page’s relevance.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Mapping out all the topics and subtopics that are of relevance to your target users and creating content to thoroughly cover your topic area.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Creating content of high value to end users. This needs to be the primary goal for each piece of content that you publish, and it requires the involvement of subject matter experts (SMEs) in creating that content. In <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#ch04_using_ai_to_scale_content_development_1748358216258351">Chapter 4</a>, we’ll go into detail as to how generative AI tools can streamline and add value to this process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Keeping your content fresh. As content ages, it may become out of date or be missing key new angles on topics, resulting in a decline in its value to users. Periodic refreshes of your most important content are a key aspect of content SEO.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>If a user is searching on a topic that is relevant to your business and you don’t have a high-quality page that directly addresses that topic, you will have no chance of ranking for that query. For that reason, one of the most important tasks in content SEO is to determine what content you want to have on your site.</p>

<p>The core goal of this effort is to build a comprehensive map of all the search queries that users may choose to enter indicating they have a need that your organization can address. Fortunately, there are many ways for you to get this type of information.</p>

<p>Keyword research <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="keyword research" data-secondary="defined" id="id358"/>can help you discover what types of phrases potential customers enter in search engines when they’re looking for a product or service like yours. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_13_1748358209361347">Figure 1-13</a> shows a portion of a sample keyword research report from <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Semrush" id="id359"/>Semrush. This type of information can help you see what content you need to create for your site. It also shows you what language the customer uses when they’re thinking about the needs they have, when those needs relate to what your product or service can do for them.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 1-13. </span>Sample Semrush keyword research report</h6>
</div></figure>

<p class="pagebreak-before">However, the authors strongly suggest that you don’t rely on keyword research alone. Research into <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="customer needs research" id="id360"/>customer needs also plays a key role. There are many ways you can do this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Talk to your salespeople and see what they are hearing from prospects.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Ask your product management or product marketing teams.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>See what search queries users are putting in your site’s search tool (if you have one—and if you don’t, you should add it as it’s a great source of information).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Survey your customers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Find out what your customer service people are hearing from customers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Provide online chat functionality to gather data from the questions asked by users on your site.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Search through relevant pages in online messaging platforms and sites like Reddit to see what relevant questions people are asking there.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are great sources of insight into what customers and potential customers are thinking their needs are. Then this information can be used to come up with a plan for the content you need to have on your site.</p>

<p>Addressing the<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="search queries" data-secondary="types of" id="search-query-type"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="long-tail search queries" id="long-tail-search"/> long tail of search is also critical. <em>Long</em><em>-</em><em>tail search queries</em> are those queries that get a smaller number of searches per month than your most popular terms. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_14_1748358209361367">Figure 1-14</a> provides a representation of the different types of search queries, ranging from highly popular queries (“head terms”) to somewhat less popular queries (“chunky middle terms”) and finally, infrequently entered queries (“long-tail terms”).</p>

<figure><div id="ch01_figure_14_1748358209361367" class="figure"><img src="assets/ugai_0114.png" width="1352" height="1408"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 1-14. </span>The long tail of search (source: <a href="https://oreil.ly/BRWC_">Ahrefs, “Long-Tail Keywords: What They Are and How to Get Search Traffic from Them,” 2021</a>)</h6>
</div></figure>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note" class="pagebreak-before less_space"><h6>Note</h6>
	<p>The Ahrefs data shared in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_14_1748358209361367">Figure 1-14</a> was created prior to the advent of Google AI Overviews or AI Mode to search. These will inevitably impact the shape of this curve. That impact is likely to increase the percentage of queries that are long tail, as users will get more and more used to entering in natural language queries.</p>
</div>

<p>Long-tail terms are important for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Cumulatively, they represent roughly one-third of the highly relevant <span class="keep-together">queries.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>They tend to be entered by customers who are deeper in the purchase funnel, so they often have more conversions than higher-volume search terms.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, these queries may represent up to half of your potential conversion volume!</p>

<p>Creating content for all your potential long-tail search terms can be tricky. Sometimes the topics are highly granular and don’t merit creating a dedicated page to address them. You can still address these queries by ensuring that related content gets covered within the context of another page on your<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="search queries" data-secondary="types of" data-startref="search-query-type" id="id361"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="long-tail search queries" data-startref="long-tail-search" id="id362"/> site.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
	<p>This focus on depth will also serve you well in optimizing for LLM search tools such as ChatGPT Search.</p>
</div>

<p>Depth and breadth of <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="depth of coverage" id="depth"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="breadth of coverage" id="breadth"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="search queries" data-secondary="depth and breadth of coverage" id="search-query-depth-breadth"/>coverage also matter. Google prefers to rank web pages that have a strong chance of addressing all of the user’s related needs. This means coming up with a plan that creates content related to all those needs. Of course, you shouldn’t create content unrelated to your business. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_15_1748358209361387">Figure 1-15</a> illustrates how and why this is important.</p>

<p>What we see is that the top page on a given topic (i.e., the page written for the related head term) will likely satisfy only a smallish percentage of users—something like 10%. Most users are going to require more information.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Knowing that might lead you to create another layer of pages—referred to as “second-level pages” in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_15_1748358209361387">Figure 1-15</a>—that address chunky middle terms. Perhaps these pages satisfy an average of another 3% of users per page, meaning that we may now be providing coverage for 35% of all users.</p>

<figure><div id="ch01_figure_15_1748358209361387" class="figure"><img src="assets/ugai_0115.png" width="1326" height="834"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 1-15. </span>Why content breadth and depth matter</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Perhaps this will cause you to consider going more granular and create another 20 pages that address some long-tail search terms. On average, these pages might address 0.9% of user needs, or 18% in total across the 20-page long-tail set. Add that to the 35% satisfied by the nine other pages, and you address the needs of 53% of users (finally over half).</p>

<p class="pagebreak-after">More advanced organizations may then choose to address a variety of very long-tail user needs with 50 more pages that average satisfying another 0.3% of users per page. Doing these nets us 15% more happy visitors and brings our total up to 68%—more than two-thirds of visitors.</p>

<p>The actual number of pages that your organization’s site may need will likely vary greatly from the specific numbers used in this example, but the same general concept will apply. You want to come up with a content plan that addresses a large percentage of user needs related to the topical areas covered on your site.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>You can also create too many long-tail pages. For example, if you’re trying to create pages that address every possible search query, even if they are minor variants of other search queries, you may run into problems. For example, queries like “resume writing services” and “writing services resume” don’t warrant a page being created for each of them—they both address the <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="depth of coverage" data-startref="depth" id="id363"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="breadth of coverage" data-startref="breadth" id="id364"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="search queries" data-secondary="depth and breadth of coverage" data-startref="search-query-depth-breadth" id="id365"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SEO (search engine optimization)" data-secondary="content SEO" data-tertiary="factors in" data-startref="seo-content-factors" id="id366"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content SEO" data-secondary="factors in" data-startref="content-seo-factors" id="id367"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="organic search" data-secondary="content SEO and" data-startref="organic-search-content-seo-factors" id="id368"/>same user need.</p>
