    But how can we scale it up to large data sets?

    you to call language models directly from Python. We discuss the most important
    library functions, including various parameters that can be used to fine-tune
    the behavior of the language model for your specific use case.

    via the Python library to analyze collections of text documents. For instance,
    our projects cover classifying text documents into one of several prespecified
    categories, extracting specific snippets of information from text, and clustering
    similar text documents together.

    tables and graph data. Here, language models are used as an interface, translating
    questions about the data (in natural language) into formal queries that can be
    processed by specialized analysis tools. For instance, the chapter demonstrates
    how to use language models to build interfaces that translate questions to queries
    in SQL that can be processed using relational database management systems.'

    The sample projects include using language models to answer arbitrary questions
    in natural language about pictures, as well as finding pairs of pictures showing
    the same person. This chapter also shows how to use language models to automatically
    caption videos based on the video content.

    generation. For instance, we see how to use OpenAI’s models to build a voice query
    interface, answering spoken questions about tabular data. We also build a translation
    tool, translating spoken input in a first language into spoken output in a second
    language according to user specifications.
