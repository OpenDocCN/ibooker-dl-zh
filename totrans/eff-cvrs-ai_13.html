   <p>People have different expectations for interacting with a chatbot than for interacting with other humans. Humans may chit-chat with each other at the start of an interaction, but chatbots usually get right to business. Humans are good at smoothing over misunderstandings, while chatbots are sometimes, well, robotic.</p>

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p3"> 
   <p>Users may have a personal bias against chatbots before an interaction starts. With a phone-based AI, they may immediately press and hold the 0 key (to get to an operator); on a chatbot, they may repeatedly type “representative.” Or they may engage in this behavior after the AI makes a mistake. In either case, we call these <em>opt-outs</em>—the user is opting out of an AI experience and opting for an interaction with a human.</p>

   <p>Chapter 11 digs into why users opt out at differing points of an interaction from the beginning to the end, and it offers techniques that make opt-outs less likely. Opt-outs cannot be eliminated, so chapter 12 shows what to do when they happen, namely summarizing the AI interaction in a manner useful for a human agent who will continue the interaction where the AI left off.</p>
