    involved in discussions on the strategic direction of a product area. However,
    what I have been observing nowadays with AI is that some strategic decisions are
    taking place even at the lowest level of a product manager’s career, and it is
    crucial for all PMs, regardless of level, to involve leadership and seek feedback
    and input from them regularly while adopting AI. This company-wide conversation
    is even more vital when you’re considering, for example, whether to build your
    AI capabilities in-house or outsource the job to external vendors. I will cover
    the build-versus-buy debate later in this chapter, but for now, know that having
    a cohesive AI strategy that permeates your company’s culture is very important.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you’ve identified how AI can be integrated into your product to solve a
    problem or create a new offering, it’s time to consider whether your AI solution
    is disruptive or sustaining*.* This is a critical strategic question, and understanding
    where your AI product fits can have a huge impact on the direction your company
    takes. Every innovative company faces this challenge, best known as the “Innovator’s
    Dilemma,” a concept Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen introduced
    in his book *The Innovator’s Dilemma* (Harvard Business Review Press, 1997). In
    the book, Christensen explores how successful companies, despite doing everything
    right, can still fail when faced with “disruptive technologies,” pointing out
    that the strategies that led to a company’s current dominance may become ineffective
    when new technologies and innovative approaches emerge, threatening to change
    the status quo.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The dilemma presents two types of innovation. A *sustaining*innovation improves
    upon existing products to better meet customer needs. It’s typically incremental—improving
    performance, reducing defects, or enhancing user experience—and it aligns with
    the company’s current strategy. For example, adding AI-driven predictive analytics
    to an existing product to offer better personalization might fall under sustaining
    innovation. The key here is that sustaining innovations meet your customers’ *current*
    needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By contrast, a *disruptive* innovation introduces a product or solution that
    initially targets niche markets or unmet needs in a way that may seem inferior
    to the current offerings. These innovations often appear less powerful, less refined,
    or less desirable to the mainstream market. However, they address a niche need
    so effectively that they eventually redefine the market. Disruptive innovations
    meet your customers’ *future* needs, potentially creating new markets or reshaping
    entire industries.

- en: Take the camera market, for example. Before the rise of smartphones, point-and-shoot
    cameras were the go-to option for anyone who wanted to take high-quality digital
    photos. But smartphones disrupted that market. Early on, smartphone cameras didn’t
    match the quality of point-and-shoot options, but they were *good enough* for
    most people and offered the added convenience of always being at hand. What was
    once a niche offering (phone cameras) quickly became the dominant product. Despite
    being “inferior” in quality at first, smartphones met the evolving needs of users—portability
    and convenience—eventually leading to the decline of standalone camera markets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What would a sustaining innovation for the camera market have been? Perhaps
    improving point-and-shoot features like megapixel count or autofocus speed—enhancements
    that serve existing users but don’t fundamentally change the nature of the product
    or market. Now consider how this applies to AI product development. The decision
    between pursuing a sustaining AI innovation and pursuing a disruptive one is crucial.
    Sustaining AI solutions may involve integrating existing AI technologies to improve
    current offerings—such as automating routine processes or improving customer service
    chatbots. These AI-driven improvements align with what your product already offers
    and are designed to help you stay competitive within your current market.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, disruptive AI innovations might challenge the way your company
    has traditionally solved problems. Perhaps you’re using AI to create an entirely
    new product category that targets an unmet need, even if it seems to offer less
    functionality or appeal at first glance. The risk is greater, but so is the potential
    reward, if you can carve out new opportunities in niche markets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Disruptive innovations tend to begin with lower performance in the areas that
    traditional customers value. They might not have the polish, reliability, or robust
    feature set that mature products possess. This makes it difficult for larger companies,
    especially those serving demanding clients, to justify investing in these nascent
    technologies. After all, why would a company move forward with a new AI-driven
    product if it doesn’t immediately match the features of its existing, proven offerings?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, disruptive innovations succeed because they *prioritize different performance
    metrics*. Rather than focusing on current users, they target new or underserved
    segments. Over time, these innovations evolve, and as they improve, they often
    surpass traditional products in ways that redefine the market.

    the statistical properties of real data while avoiding any accidental patterns
    that could bias your model. Always validate your synthetic data against real samples
    when possible, and keep checking that your model’s performance holds up in real-world conditions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and grounding methods intersect
    with multiple learning techniques and are essential in determining how your AI
    model will function, integrate with existing data, and enhance user experiences.
    Several factors come into play, including latency, data availability, accuracy
    requirements, and scalability. Here’s a more detailed look at each option, along
    with real-world AI product examples.

- en: 'Fine-tuning involves taking a pretrained model and training it further on a
    specific dataset tailored to the problem at hand. It’s most useful when your model
    needs to adapt its understanding based on new data to specialize in a particular
    task or domain. It’s best used for scenarios where the accuracy of the model is
    paramount and the task is well-defined. Fine-tuning is resource intensive: it
    requires substantial labeled data and computational power.'

- en: Content moderation tools, like those used by social media platforms such as
    Facebook, are often fine-tuned to specialize in detecting hate speech or inappropriate
    content. The investment in fine-tuning is justified by the need for high precision
    and minimal errors. As another example, an audio streaming service might use fine-tuning
    to generate better personalized recommendations, training the model on user-specific
    listening behaviors to predict what songs a user is likely to enjoy.

- en: RAG
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: RAG enhances generative models by incorporating a retrieval mechanism that accesses
    a large corpus of information. It provides up-to-date information dynamically,
    without requiring the model itself to be fully retrained. It’s best used for dynamic,
    information-heavy contexts in which the model needs to access specific information
    that is not directly encoded in its parameters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: RAG is particularly effective for use cases in which information changes frequently,
    such as news or market trends. To continue our example, a music streaming service
    might use RAG to recommend music or podcasts that align with current social media
    trends or recent news about artists, offering real-time relevance. For instance,
    if a particular song becomes popular on TikTok, RAG could retrieve this information
    and use it to tailor recommendations quickly.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Grounding uses preexisting context, usually via prompt engineering, to guide
    a base model’s behavior. It’s a more lightweight approach, adding instructions
    or context to influence the model’s responses or predictions. I have seen it used
    when rapid iterations are needed and the model requires only slight adjustments
    or context to perform effectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This approach is less resource intensive than fine-tuning and does not require
    large datasets. For instance, in a customer support chatbot like those used by
    ecommerce platforms, you could implement grounding by prompting the model to adopt
    a particular tone, focus on specific information, or follow a predefined conversation
    flow. This can be especially useful during product experimentation, where changes
    need to be made quickly without retraining the model.
