- en: We’ve explored how to use transformers to download a model and put together
    an easy pipeline that lets you use it for inference or fine-tuning. However, I’d
    be remiss if I didn’t show you the open source Ollama project, which ties it all
    together by giving you an environment that gives you a full wrapper around an
    LLM that you can either chat with in your terminal or use as a server that you
    can HTTP POST to and read the output from.

- en: Technologies like Ollama will be the vanguard of the next generation of LLMs,
    which will let you have dedicated servers inside your data center or dedicated
    processes on your computer. That will make them completely private to you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At its core, Ollama is an open source project that simplifies the process of
    downloading, running, and managing LLMs on your computer. It also handles nonfunctional
    difficult requirements, such as memory management and model optimization, and
    it provides standardized interfaces for interaction, such as the ability to HTTP
    POST to your models.

- en: Ollama is also a key strategic tool you should consider because it bridges the
    gap between cloud-based third-party services like GPT, Claude, and Gemini and
    locally deployed services. It goes beyond giving you a local development environment
    to giving you one that you could, for example, use within your own data center
    to serve multiple internal users.

    eliminate network latency, and work offline. This is especially crucial in scenarios
    involving sensitive data or applications that require consistent, low-latency
    responses.

- en: Ollama also supports a growing library of popular open source models, including
    Llama, Mistral, and Gemma, and it also supports various specialized models that
    are optimized for specific tasks. Each model can be pulled and run with simple
    commands, in a way that’s similar to how Docker containers work. The platform
    handles model quantization automatically, optimizing models to run efficiently
    on consumer hardware while maintaining good performance.

    started, looking at how you can instantiate specific models and use them, and
    exploring the RESTful APIs that let you build LLM applications that preserve privacy.'

    straightforward to get up and running, and the home screen gives download options
    for macOS, Linux, and Windows. Note also that the Windows version needs Windows
    Subsystem for Linux (WSL). For this chapter, I’m using the macOS version.

    it in the system bar at the top of the screen. Your main interface with Ollama
    will be the command line.

    [model’s documentation page on Ollama](https://oreil.ly/VMLKO). While Ollama can
    and will quantize models that are optimized to run locally, it can’t perform miracles,
    and only models that will fit in your system resources—most importantly, memory—will
    work. In this case, I ran the `gemma2:2b` (2-billion parameter) version, which
    requires about 8 GB of GPU RAM. On macOS, the shared RAM with the M-Series chips
    works well, while running on an M1 Mac with 16 Gb, the Gemma 2B is fast and smooth
    with Ollama.

    if your terminal supported it, and you dragged and dropped an image into the terminal,
    you could ask the model what it could see in the image. The multimodal power of
    Llama would parse the image for you, and Ollama would handle all the technical
    difficulties.

    did the rest.    You can see in [Figure 17-3](#ch17_figure_4_1748550058907880)
    how detailed the results were. This is a photo I took of Osaka castle one morning
    while on a run in 2018\. While Llama couldn’t guess the date, it was able to predict
    the season based on the foliage in the image. It got everything else correct and
    gave very detailed output!  ![](assets/aiml_1703.png)  ###### Figure 17-3\. Using
    Ollama for a multimodal model    While it’s really cool to have a local LLM that
    you can chat with in a privacy-preserving way, I think the real power in Ollama
    is in using it as a server that can then be the foundation of an application.

    explored some scenarios with it. You also downloaded and used models like the
    simple, lightweight Gemma from Google, as well as the powerful, multimodal Llama3.2-vision
    from Meta. You explored not just chatting with them but also attaching files to
    upload. Ollama gives you an HTTP endpoint that you saw how to experiment with
    by using a `curl` command to simulate HTTP traffic. Finally, you got into writing
    a prototype of a real-world LLM-based application that analyzed contents of books,
    first as a simple Python script that proved the concept and then as a more sophisticated
    web-based application in `node.js` that used an Ollama backend and a Gemma LLM
    to do the heavy lifting!    In the next chapter, we’ll build on this and explore
    the concepts of RAG, and you’ll build apps that use local vector databases to
