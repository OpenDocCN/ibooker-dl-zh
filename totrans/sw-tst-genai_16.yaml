- en: To better understand the process of setting up Copilot, let’s briefly discuss
    how the tool works. Since Copilot relies on GPT models that need to rapidly analyze
    our work and suggest code snippets, it requires a large amount of resources to
    respond quickly. Therefore, when using Copilot, we don’t install the AI system
    on our machines; instead, we install plugins that grant us the ability to send
    our snippets of work to Copilot for processing and to receive recommended code,
    as demonstrated in figure B.1.

- en: As the diagram demonstrates, we install a plugin into our IDE and grant it access
    so that the plugin can monitor what we’re typing, send it to Copilot, and then
    process and display Copilot’s recommendations. Because of this structure, Copilot
    works with a range of IDEs, including JetBrains products, Visual Studio, VS Code,
    and more. For our example, we’ll use IntelliJ Community Edition, but the process
    in which we set up an IDE for Copilot is largely the same regardless of the chosen
    IDE.

    details are required, but the account can be canceled via the billing page ([https://github.com/settings/billing](https://github.com/settings/billing)).

- en: Copilot also requires that we have a GitHub account, so before setting up Copilot,
    we need to ensure that we have created a free GitHub account. Once that is done,
    or if you already have an account, head to [https://github.com/features/copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
    to complete the process of setting up a Copilot trial.

- en: Once we’ve added Copilot to our GitHub account, we can set up our IDE to access
    it. For IntelliJ, we do this via its plugin service by either selecting Plugins
    via the Welcome to IntelliJ IDEA window or heading to Preferences > Plugins. Once
    the Plugin window is opened, search for Copilot and install the plugin. If for
    any reason more search results are returned for Copilot plugins, look for the
    plugin authored by GitHub. Finally, restart IntelliJ to complete the plugin installation.

    page [https://github.com/login/device](https://github.com/login/device). To enter
    the device code from the IDE, we can type or paste into the form and submit it.
    GitHub will then request us to grant access permission to Copilot, which, once
    confirmed, will complete the sign-in process. We can confirm that we are signed
    in when we return to our IDE and see a new pop-up informing us that we are connected,
    as shown in figure B.5.

    begin to write code into an IDE. For example, we could create an empty class called
    `TaxCalculator`, enter the keyword `public`, and after a few seconds receive a
    suggestion like the one shown in figure B.7.
