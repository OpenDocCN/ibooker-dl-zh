- en: Have you ever had a bad experience with a chatbot? Perhaps with a voice system
    that always tells you “please listen carefully—our menu options have recently
    changed” or a chatbot that never understands your questions. Hopefully you’ve
    had great experiences with AI as well—AI that seems like it knows you and proactively
    identifies your needs. What separates good conversational AI from the bad?

  zh: 你是否有过与聊天机器人糟糕的体验？可能是一个总是告诉你“请仔细聆听——我们的菜单选项最近已更改”的语音系统，或者是一个永远不理解你问题的聊天机器人。希望你也曾有过与AI的美好体验——一个似乎了解你并能主动识别你需求的AI。是什么让好的对话式AI与差的AI区分开来？
- en: Conversational AI is bigger than ever, as companies look to improve customer
    experience and their own bottom line through this technology. Generative AI has
    rekindled interest in the technology and made it easier than ever to add intelligence
    to a chatbot. Many of these chatbots look great in a prototype phase and then
    falter in production. This part of our book sets the stage for building and improving
    conversational AI.

  zh: 随着公司寻求通过这项技术提升客户体验和自身盈利能力，对话式AI比以往任何时候都更加重要。生成式AI重新点燃了对这项技术的兴趣，并使得向聊天机器人添加智能变得比以往任何时候都更容易。许多这些聊天机器人在原型阶段看起来很棒，但在生产阶段却失败了。本书的这一部分为构建和改进对话式AI奠定了基础。
- en: Chapter 1 introduces conversational AI and generative AI technology, their pros
    and cons, and how they complement each other. It also lays out the types of pain
    points many AI solutions run into. Chapter 2 shows you how to build and evolve
    a chatbot, layering on incremental complexity and capability, ending with a hybrid
    of traditional and generative techniques. Chapter 3 demonstrates how to objectively
    evaluate your AI and develop plans to improve it.
