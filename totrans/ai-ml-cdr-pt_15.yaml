    ecosystems. In this chapter, we’ll look at the various options of pretrained models
    and the associated tools and resources used to download, instantiate, and use
    them for inference.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the PyTorch framework provides the foundation for deep learning, the community
    has created numerous repositories and hubs that store models that are ready to
    use and extend, making it easier for you to use and extend existing work rather
    than starting from scratch. I like to call this “standing on the shoulders of
    giants.”

- en: Since the advent of generative AI, these hubs have exploded in popularity, and
    many scenarios of generative ML models within workflows have grown out of this.
    As a result, when it comes to using pretrained models, there are many options.
    You might use them directly for inference, taking advantage of those trained on
    massive datasets that would be impractical to replicate. Or you might use these
    models as starting points for fine-tuning, adapting them to specific domains or
    tasks while retaining their learned features. This can take the form of low-rank
    adaption (LoRA), as we’ll discuss in [Chapter 20](ch20.html#ch20_tuning_generative_image_models_with_lora_and_diffu_1748550104901965),
    or *transfer learning*, in which knowledge from one task is applied to another.
    Transfer learning or other fine-tuning has become a standard practice, especially
    when working with limited data or computational resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The advantages of using pretrained models extend beyond saving computational
    resources and time. These models often represent state-of-the-art architectures,
    and they’ve been trained on diverse, high-quality datasets that you may not have
    direct access to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, the providers generally release the model with extensive documentation,
    performance benchmarks, and community support, giving you a long head start. Given
    the importance of responsible AI, these models often come with model cards that
    help you understand any research and work done so you can navigate any potential
    responsibility issues.

    PyTorch Hub offers officially supported implementations. Platforms like Kaggle

    them effectively. As the field of deep learning continues to advance, these hubs
    play an increasingly crucial role in widening access to state-of-the-art models
    and enabling rapid development of AI applications. And as the role of AI developer
    matures and grows, I’m personally seeing huge growth in the careers of software
    developers who don’t train models from scratch and instead use or fine-tune existing
    ones. To that end, I hope this chapter helps you grow!

    Hub has emerged as a leading platform for discovering and using pretrained ML
    models, particularly for NLP. Much of its usefulness (and a significant driver
    of its success) is the open source availability of two things: a transformers
    library (which makes using pretrained language models very easy to use) and a
    diffusers library (which does the same for text-to-image generative models like
    stable diffusion).'

    into a comprehensive ecosystem supporting computer vision, audio processing, and
    reinforcement learning models. It has grown into a one-stop shop combining version
    control for models, documentation, and model cards—and because of the PyTorch-friendly
    libraries like transformers and diffusers, using these models with your Python
    and PyTorch skills is relatively easy.

    a look at how to use the transformers and diffusers libraries from Hugging Face,
    which encapsulate model loading and instantiation. With these, you have the keys
    to over 900,000 publicly available models. As a bonus, many of these have comprehensive
    documentation and model cards to get you up and running quickly and responsibly.
    You also got hands-on with using them, including setting up your account and getting
    authentication from Hugging Face using tokens.    Hugging Face APIs offer pipelines
    that encapsulate many of the common tasks of using models, such as tokenization
    and sequencing for NLP under the hood, making your coding surface much easier.
    We explored these with a text sentiment analysis scenario as well as another for
    image classification.    While PyTorch Hub has a lot less in it and accessing
    the models can be brittle in comparison, it’s worth looking at because it’s still
    well used in the research community. We looked at how to access PyTorch Vision
    models, prepare data for inference, and handle model outputs. The Hub also includes
    practical examples of using pretrained models like ResNet50 for image classification.    Ultimately,
    you should consider the advantages of using pretrained models, which have been
    built by expert researchers who have used expensive hardware and high-quality
    datasets that you may not otherwise have access to. To that end, you may find
    that using and fine-tuning existing models rather than training from scratch might
    be better for your scenario. We’re going to explore that over the next few chapters,
    starting with [Chapter 15](ch15.html#ch15_transformers_and_transformers_1748549808974580),
    where we will go deeper into using LLMs with Hugging Face Transformers.` ``'
