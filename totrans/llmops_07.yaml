    and evaluation than those used in traditional software development. In particular,
    ML models use random numbers during training and need to be tested in aggregate
    across datasets, as well as on specific atomic pieces of data that can help validate
    that the training worked correctly. However, once the models are trained, most
    ML models are deterministic in that they don’t use random methods to make inferences;
    i.e., that the same inputs will always produce the same outputs.

    fails an evaluation task, the developing team usually turns to *interpretability*
    tools that explain why the model made decisions. Such tools try to understand
    the internal mechanisms of models by running an extremely large number of examples
    through a model and measuring how changes in the input influence the output. Since
    most ML models are deterministic (the same input will always provide the same
    output), these tools allow developers to understand what parts of the input are
    important for generating some outputs, essentially improving their understanding
    of how the model works internally. ​As of today, interpretability tools are unavailable
    for LLMs because LLMs have too many parameters and are nondeterministic; thus,
    an immense quantity of examples and computation time would be needed to understand
    their internal ​workings.

    solutions during development and after deployment. *Manually checking* the output
    for accuracy and correctness can be time-consuming, and it depends on the judgment
    of evaluators. *Automatic evaluation* uses tools to evaluate the accuracy of the
    LLM’s output; essentially, you’re using LLMs to evaluate LLMs. User feedback is
    also helpful in identifying areas where the LLM is performing poorly and needs
    improvement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most importantly, you cannot evaluate an LLM without an application. In many
    LLM applications, users know which real-world performance metrics would be useful.
    For example, let’s say your company is using LLMs to generate text scripts for
    web advertisements. When humans write the advertising copy, a typical evaluation
    method is to perform an *A/B test*, randomly offering different options to similar
    audiences, A and B, and measuring the success rate (for example, number of ad
    clicks) of each audience. If the success rate for the audience receiving option
    A is different enough from that of option B to be statistically significant, the
    company would select option A as the more successful script. The same method can
    be used on LLM-generated copy. Indeed, for many common ML tasks, such as classifying
    text, identifying images, and counting objects, it makes sense to simply use the
    existing pre-LLM methods and metrics.

    user involvement, making them less costly and good choices to evaluate LLMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since a major part of what LLMs do is generate content, we use a set of metrics
    called *generative metrics* to measure the quality of the content generated. The
    most basic of these, called n*-gram-based metrics*, assess the similarity between
    generated text and existing data by examining the overlap of sequences of *n*
    words. To use this metric for an evaluation, you should know the expected “correct”
    answer, and you can compare how many of the *n* words generated by the LLM are
    in the correct answer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if *n* equals 1, the comparison looks at individual words; if *n*
    equals 2, it considers pairs of words; and so on. These metrics quantify the degree
    of similarity based on the shared *n*-grams, providing insights into the coherence
    and relevance of the generated text compared to the correct answer.

    Paris.” The *n*-gram test can be very simple and will work well when the LLM answers
    “Paris” (100% of the *n*-grams match) but won’t perform well when the LLM provides
    the correct answer “The capital of France is Paris.” Since you were expecting
    the answer to be Paris, only 16.6% of the words in the second answer match the
    correct answer, and you may think that the LLM is not performing as well as it

    failures”. The system continues to operate normally on the surface, producing
    outputs that look syntactically valid and stylistically coherent. Yet beneath
    this veneer, these outputs can be factually incorrect, ethically problematic,

    metrics, human-in-the-loop validation, and domain-specific checks to identify
    when the model’s assumptions no longer hold, or when outputs deviate from expected

    most infamous and challenging to manage. Hallucinations happen when an LLM produces
    responses that are linguistically fluent and confident, yet factually incorrect
    or completely fabricated. This phenomenon arises because LLMs generate text by
    predicting the most statistically likely token sequences based on their training
    data, rather than querying a reliable, up-to-date factual knowledge base. Therefore,
    hallucinations are an inherent risk, especially when LLMs are applied in high-stakes
    domains such as healthcare, finance, or legal services, where inaccurate or misleading
    information can lead to serious consequences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Evaluating hallucinations extends beyond simply detecting isolated factual errors.
    Instead, it demands a systematic, longitudinal approach to pattern monitoring.
    This typically involves logging all generated outputs and, where possible, comparing
    them to verified ground truths. When exact ground-truth data isn’t accessible,
    one alternative strategy is conducting consistency checks across multiple generations
    of the model’s responses to detect contradictions or instability. These evaluation
    methods help identify individual hallucinations as well as the conditions and
    contexts in which they occur more frequently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In RAG systems, hallucinations often signal problems in the retrieval component.
    For instance, if the retriever fetches irrelevant, outdated, or low-quality documents,
    the LLM is more likely to generate incorrect or fabricated content. This interdependence
    makes it important to maintain observability across both the retrieval and inference
    layers. Comprehensive monitoring frameworks that track the quality and relevance
    of retrieved documents alongside the model’s output can help diagnose whether
    hallucinations are stemming from retrieval failures, generative errors, or a combination
    of both. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing targeted mitigation
    strategies, such as improving retrieval accuracy, integrating more reliable knowledge
    sources, or incorporating verification mechanisms during generation.

    the quality of the model’s outputs. These degradations are often not immediately

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of continuous flux. This dynamic landscape often leads to data drift, a phenomenon
    where the foundational assumptions embedded in a system–such as expected input
    formats, distributions of user intents, or the nature of contextual embeddings–gradually
    diverge from the evolving reality of incoming data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data drift manifests in several distinct ways. Input drift typically shows up
    as an increase in adversarial or malformed queries that deviate from the original
    training or design expectations. This can stress the system’s robustness and degrade
    output quality. Retriever drift occurs when the relevance of the documents returned
    by retrieval components declines, even if the retrieval algorithms and configurations
    remain unchanged. Similarly, embedding drift arises when the vector representations
    used to compare semantic similarity become less effective, causing retrieval systems
    to fail despite stable system parameters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Effectively evaluating drift demands rigorous statistical monitoring of input
    feature distributions over time. Techniques include cluster analyses of query
    types to detect emerging user intents or new patterns of interaction, histograms
    of token lengths to track shifts in input verbosity, and continuous measurement
    of embedding similarity scores to catch subtle shifts in semantic representation.
    These quantitative early-warning signals allow engineering teams to anticipate
    when the system’s assumptions will no longer hold.

    a phenomenon called nondeterminism. This variability is a natural consequence
    of probabilistic token sampling strategies, which promote diversity and creativity
    in generated text. However, this randomness presents a fundamental challenge for

    To compute it, you start with a “ground-truth” collection of documents that experts
    have already judged relevant to a query. When the retrieval step runs, you look
    at the overlap between this authoritative set and the documents the system produced.
    If the engine surfaces almost every item the experts identified, recall is considered
    high; if it misses many of them, recall is low. You can measure the result as
    a percentage.

- en: Mean reciprocal rank (MRR)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This measures how quickly a user sees the first genuinely useful result. For
    each query, scan the ranked list from the top until you encounter the first relevant
    document and note its position. A document in the first slot is ideal, one in
    the fifth slot is less impressive, and so on. You then convert those positions
    into scores that reward early appearance and average the scores across many queries.
    A high MRR means that users usually encounter something relevant right at or near
    the top of the page. Although you can use whatever scoring mechanism you want,
    a typical way to score a search that retrieves *n* documents is to assign *n*
    points if a correct answer comes in the first position, *n* – 1 if it comes in
    the second position, and so on.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the list. Working down through the results for a single query, you keep a running
    tally so that every time another relevant document appears, you check what fraction
    of everything seen so far is relevant. When you finish the list, you average those
    interim fractions to summarize that one query. For example, if your retrieval
    step is expected to return three results and the three results returned are relevant,
    the average precision is 100%. If the first and second results are relevant, the
    AP is (100% + 100% + 0%) / 3 = 67%. If the first and third results are relevant,
    the AP is (100% + 0% + 67%) / 3 = 56%. Repeating the process for many queries
    and averaging again yields MAP. For example, the MAP of the last two queries is
    (67%+ 56%) / 2 = 61%. A high value indicates that relevant documents show up frequently
    and are distributed toward the top of the result rather than being scattered sparsely
    or bunched near the bottom.

    returned, how much of it is genuinely helpful? You inspect each passage to decide
    whether it supports the language model’s task or merely adds noise. When the bulk
    of retrieved results match the ground-truth collection of documents, context precision
    is high; when irrelevant or misleading passages dominate, the score drops. You
    can measure context precision as a percentage.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    both how completely the retrieved set covers the needed facts and how free it
    is of extraneous material. High relevance means the context supplied to the language
    model simultaneously contains nearly all critical information and avoids clutter,
    thereby giving the model an ideal foundation for an accurate, focused response.
    Although you can calculate relevance by taking the simple average (or even the
    sum) of precision and recall, practitioners typically take the harmonic mean of
    precision and recall (this is called the F1-score), which makes balanced results
    like 60% precision and 60% recall score higher than unbalanced results like 90%
    precision and 30% recall.

    underlying model can change outside of your control. This is called *model drift*

    Therefore, the two main ways of evaluating agentic systems are human evaluators

    can be expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, using LLMs as evaluators
    often strikes a good balance among cost, quality, and effectiveness, but it can
    occasionally be biased. Two other problems are that LLMs are opaque and resource
    intensive. If you use an LLM evaluator, don’t be completely hands-off. An LLM
    evaluating a model can start to perform poorly, so it’s advisable to have some

    automated metrics can make it a lot easier for you to see whether changes are
    improving your application. For example, let’s say you have an application that
    generates text that describes an image. Your existing prompt has an NPS of 90%,
    but a new paper is proposing a different prompting technique (for example, using
    bullet points). If your metrics are automated, it’s easier to create an A/B test,
    offering output from the existing prompt to audience A and from the new prompt
    to audience B. You should expect the NPS of audience A to remain close to 90%
    (since it’s using the existing prompt). If the NPS of audience B, the one using
    the new prompt, is higher, you can decide to switch everyone to the new prompt.
  prefs: []

    frequently try to reduce prompts while keeping the same performance. Since most
    LLMs are priced (or consume resources) based on prompt size, you want to use the
    smallest prompt that achieves a given quality threshold. You don’t even need to
    generate the smaller prompts yourself; you can use an LLM to summarize or reduce
    existing prompts while keeping the meaning and intention of the original prompt.
    If you have automated metrics, you can then test several prompts and select the
    smallest one that achieves your performance requirements. This can save enormous
    amounts of money and resources. Of course, you can also do this without using
    automated metrics, but it will take a lot longer.

    unexpected issues. For example, it’s possible that some guardrails that you had
    to implement to prevent errors in earlier versions of the model are not necessary
    anymore. A typical case is dedicating a large portion of the prompt to safeguards
    against biases and offensive answers. Newer versions of models typically incorporate
    defenses against several known attacks, so including these defenses in your prompts
    might become just a waste of money.

- en: As we discussed earlier, in the RAG and Agents Evaluation section, standard
    metrics such as accuracy and loss have long served as foundational indicators
    of model performance during the training and validation phases. These metrics
    effectively quantify how well a model fits its training data or generalizes to
    held-out validation sets. However, they fall short in capturing the nuanced and
    multifaceted failure modes that emerge once models are deployed in complex, real-world
    production environments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In production, outputs can be syntactically fluent and stylistically polished,
    yet harbor hallucinations, latent biases, or structural inconsistencies that traditional
    metrics like accuracy or loss simply do not detect. These subtle issues often
    have serious downstream consequences, from propagating misinformation to causing
    ethical violations and user dissatisfaction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    are specifically designed for continuous, real-time monitoring of model behavior.
    These systems focus on detecting anomalies, tracking data and concept drift, assessing
    user impact, and identifying emerging ethical risks. Effective evaluation in this
    context requires more than just recognizing failure modes; it calls for architecting
    comprehensive observability pipelines that can capture these failures early and
    with high fidelity.

    stages in the inference or data-processing pipeline where they arose, whether
    that means input preprocessing, retrieval components, the generative model itself,
    or post-processing layers. Such granular mapping lets engineering teams perform
    rapid root-cause analysis, prioritize fixes, and confidently roll out mitigations.
    This proactive, end-to-end monitoring infrastructure transforms evaluation from
    a reactive afterthought into a strategic, integral part of maintaining reliability,

    prompts it receives. In production environments, prompts are rarely fixed, handcrafted
    snippets. Instead, they are dynamically generated, assembled from templates, and
    parameterized based on upstream data sources or evolving user state. This dynamism
    introduces complexity and variability that can subtly undermine the system’s performance
    if not carefully managed.

    prompts must be syntactically valid, correctly formatted, and free from errors
    that could disrupt parsing or tokenization. Second, they need to be semantically
    coherent, providing clear, unambiguous instructions that align with the model’s
    expected input format. Third, rigorous version control of prompt templates and
    their variants is essential. By capturing every prompt version and structural
    modification, teams gain traceability that links downstream inference errors directly
    back to specific prompt changes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To prevent cascading failures during model inference, it’s important to detect
    malformed inputs early, such as missing context variables or incorrectly injected
    parameters. Monitoring metrics like prompt token length distribution is another
    key operational practice. Excessively long prompts risk being truncated, which
    can omit vital context and degrade the output quality. Conversely, prompts that
    are too short may fail to provide sufficient context, effectively starving the
    model of the information it needs to generate accurate and relevant responses.
    By continuously tracking these distributions, teams can proactively identify regressions
    and intervene before they impact end users’ experience.

    such as hallucinations or vague, nonspecific responses, caused by irrelevant or
    outdated documents. Once this kind of drift is detected, timely interventions
    include retraining the retriever, refreshing the index, and reconfiguring the
