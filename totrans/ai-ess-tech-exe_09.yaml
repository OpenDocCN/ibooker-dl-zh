    future products. If it is, build it. If not, buy it. When you’ve decided that
    buying is the right choice, finding the right tool is your next step.

    analysis to speed up debugging. Because this was only going to be used by the

    tools like [Hex](https://hex.tech) and [Julius](https://julius.ai).

    informing your strategic decisions for applying it in your business. It’s also
    a great way to inspire ideas for adding new AI features to your products. You’ve
    hopefully been using ChatGPT and Claude already, but here are a few other AI tools

    buying it instead of building it. You don’t need to become a tech expert, but
    by identifying opportunities for tools to save you time and improve your workflows,
    you’ll be better positioned to lead your organization in the AI space.
