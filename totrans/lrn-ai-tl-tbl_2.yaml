    belt, it’s time to dive in to getting hands-on experience with Tableau Pulse.
    In this chapter, I’ll take you step by step through everything you’ll need to
    know to get your first Pulse metric ready. I’ll walk you through key concepts
    and definitions, and you’ll see detailed images to help you navigate the platform.

- en: I recently saw a presentation on Tableau Pulse about its purpose. The presenter
    said that Pulse was designed to answer the 20% of questions that users ask 80%
    of the time. This is a common trope in data analytics, the Pareto principle, that
    helps to give an understanding of how Pulse fits into the Tableau ecosystem. To
    unpack this 80/20 principle a bit further, the speaker posited that end users
    tend to ask the same small subset of questions (the 20%) a majority of the time
    (80%). As an analytics professional, you might find this a little appalling, but
    take a step back, and there’s a decent amount of truth there. Imagine a social
    media manager who is tracking a campaign on Instagram. She may want to start her
    day by looking at key metrics that give her a sense of how the campaign is performing.
    Similarly, when you first get into your car, you may check the fuel gauge, see
    if the check engine light is on, and monitor tire pressure. That’s how you can
    imagine Pulse, and while I’ve not found any documentation to confirm, I have to
    imagine its name is based on the phrase *keeping your finger on the pulse*.

    Cloud. Tableau Cloud is the software as a service (SaaS) solution of Tableau Server,
    the web application that organizes, stores, and serves up Tableau content. Based
    on the architecture of how Pulse functions (see [Figure 2-1](#ch02_figure_1_1732595607634526)),
    I imagine that this limitation is due to the necessity for information to be taken
    from Tableau and passed through to an LLM that is completely separate and unrelated
    to the Tableau software. Similarly, the audit trail of the prompts would necessitate
    that information gets written to the Salesforce Data Cloud, which would require
    that the Tableau environment is available on the internet (not just a corporate
    intranet).

    to the site settings. In the General section, you’ll be given the option to turn
    it on for all users within a site or a single specified group of users. This configuration
    section includes some info on what Pulse does and explains that it is currently
    being updated on a frequent (biweekly) basis. [Figure 2-1](#ch02_figure_1_1732595607634526)

    a particular scope of analysis. Its key benefit is the knowledge that each subsequent
    analysis, visualization, and metric are functioning off the same underlying data.
    Additionally, a published data source minimizes data-source proliferation and
    unnecessarily redundant connections to the same data in source systems. In a very
    mature Tableau environment, you can imagine that one published data source can
    fuel a whole body of analytical content (multiple dashboards, ad hoc analyses,
    and metrics).

    of the metric definition that can include the application of the filters and time
    comparisons that were instantiated in the definition. Say, for example, you construct
    a sales metric that allows an end user to filter by region and set the time range
    for display. If there are four regions in your data, you can imagine that there
    could be four iterations of the metric, one for each region. Similarly, there
    can be metrics for different time intervals chosen (like this year, this month).

    an office. Each row of data within the Superstore data set represents a line item
    on a receipt. Imagine you purchased two binders, three mousepads, and one bottle
    of water. There would be three records (rows) for your transaction, one for each
    unique product, which include the quantity of each. You would also see the order
    number repeated for each of these three records, since they were all purchased
    within the same transaction.

    interact with. First, there are the Overview and Breakdown sections. The Overview
    section is exactly that, a visualization showing an aggregate of the metric for
    the time period, comparisons with other time periods, and a line chart of the
    sales (refer to [Figure 2-18](#ch02_figure_18_1732595607634885)). If you click
    Breakdown, the visualization changes to show a bar chart that separates out Sales
    by each Category, as shown in [Figure 2-19](#ch02_figure_19_1732595607634904).
    This directly corresponds with the adjustable metric filters configured in the
    metric definition.

    for the top insight associated with the metric. This metric shows a bar chart
    similar to the Breakdown chart, but with a summarized insights blurb and a percentage
    value for the distribution of sales among each category. You can click the thumbs
    up or thumbs down icons to provide feedback on whether the insight was helpful
    or not helpful to you, as seen in [Figure 2-20](#ch02_figure_20_1732595607634923).

    Pulse employs a scoring system to rank and surface the most statistically impactful
    insights to end users in their summaries. This becomes more apparent when a user
    follows multiple metrics and receives summaries of all their followed metrics
    in addition to individual insights for metrics. Additionally, this scoring system
    is influenced by the thumbs up/down feedback from a user on the deeper insights
    that surface.
