<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_3">B.1 Setting up Copilot</h2>
<p class="body">To better understand the process of setting up Copilot, let’s briefly discuss how the tool works. Since Copilot relies on GPT models that need to rapidly analyze our work and suggest code snippets, it requires a large amount of resources to respond quickly. Therefore, when using Copilot, we don’t install the AI system on our machines; instead, we install plugins that grant us the ability to send our snippets of work to Copilot for processing and to receive recommended code, as demonstrated in figure B.1.</p>
<p class="body">As the diagram demonstrates, we install a plugin into our IDE and grant it access so that the plugin can monitor what we’re typing, send it to Copilot, and then process and display Copilot’s recommendations. Because of this structure, Copilot works with a range of IDEs, including JetBrains products, Visual Studio, VS Code, and more. For our example, we’ll use IntelliJ Community Edition, but the process in which we set up an IDE for Copilot is largely the same regardless of the chosen IDE.</p>

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_4">B.1.1 Setting up a Copilot account</h3>
<p class="body">The first step is to set up an account with Copilot. At the time this chapter was written, Copilot offered two plans:<a id="idIndexMarker001"/><a id="marker-267"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">$10 per month for individuals</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">$19 per month for businesses</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">Although a Copilot account is paid for, GitHub offers a 30-day free trial. Payment details are required, but the account can be canceled via the billing page (<a class="url" href="https://github.com/settings/billing">https://github.com/settings/billing</a>).</p>
<p class="body">Copilot also requires that we have a GitHub account, so before setting up Copilot, we need to ensure that we have created a free GitHub account. Once that is done, or if you already have an account, head to <a class="url" href="https://github.com/features/copilot">https://github.com/features/copilot</a> to complete the process of setting up a Copilot trial.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_5">B.1.2 Installing the Copilot plugin</h3>
<p class="body">Once we’ve added Copilot to our GitHub account, we can set up our IDE to access it. For IntelliJ, we do this via its plugin service by either selecting Plugins via the Welcome to IntelliJ IDEA window or heading to Preferences &gt; Plugins. Once the Plugin window is opened, search for Copilot and install the plugin. If for any reason more search results are returned for Copilot plugins, look for the plugin authored by GitHub. Finally, restart IntelliJ to complete the plugin installation.<a id="marker-268"/><a id="idIndexMarker002"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_6">B.1.3 Granting access to your Copilot account</h3>
<p class="body">With the plugin installed, upon reopening IntelliJ, we are presented with a small pop-up in the lower right corner that looks like the one shown in figure B.2.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre56" src="../../OEBPS/Images/APPB_F02_Winteringham2.png"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure B.2 This popup asks you to sign in to GitHub.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">Alternatively, if no pop-up appears (or if it is accidentally dismissed), we can access the sign-in process via the small Copilot icon that has a thick line through its face, as shown in figure B.3.<a id="idIndexMarker003"/></p>

<p class="figurecaption">Figure B.3 The location of the Copilot plugin in IntelliJ</p>
</div>
<p class="body">Upon clicking the pop-up, we are presented with a window that describes the process of signing in to GitHub and granting access to our IDE to Copilot, as shown in figure B.4.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="figurecaption">Figure B.4 This dialog box details how to sign in to GitHub via our IDE.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">To complete the sign-up process, we take the device code and head to the web page <a class="url" href="https://github.com/login/device">https://github.com/login/device</a>. To enter the device code from the IDE, we can type or paste into the form and submit it. GitHub will then request us to grant access permission to Copilot, which, once confirmed, will complete the sign-in process. We can confirm that we are signed in when we return to our IDE and see a new pop-up informing us that we are connected, as shown in figure B.5.</p>

<p class="figurecaption">Figure B.5 This popup confirms that we are connected to Copilot.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">We also see a confirmation that the Copilot plugin is installed when we start editing our code and see a pop-up that shares details on how it works within our IDE, as shown in figure B.6.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre60" src="../../OEBPS/Images/APPB_F06_Winteringham2.png"/></p>

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_7">B.2 Working with Copilot</h2>
<p class="body">Once Copilot is set up, it will start to react and offer suggestions when we begin to write code into an IDE. For example, we could create an empty class called <code class="fm-code-in-text">TaxCalculator</code>, enter the keyword <code class="fm-code-in-text">public</code>, and after a few seconds receive a suggestion like the one shown in figure B.7.<a id="idIndexMarker005"/></p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="figurecaption">Figure B.7 A suggested code coming from GitHub Copilot</p>
</div>
<p class="body">Notice how the suggested code is grayed out. To confirm that we want to add the code to our class, we do so by hitting the Tab key. This will then insert the code and bring the cursor to the end of the code that has been added.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_8">B.2.1 Exploring suggestions</h3>
<p class="body">If the suggested code is unsatisfactory, we can review other suggestions from Copilot to determine if they are a better fit. To do this, we need to open the GitHub Copilot window that is found on the right side of the IDE, as shown in figure B.8.<a id="marker-270"/><a id="idIndexMarker006"/></p>

</div>
<p class="body">Selecting that will then open a new window that presents a list of other suggested code that could be added to our class. The panel may ask you to click Refresh to request suggested code from Copilot, but once it’s complete, you will see something similar to figure B.9.</p>
