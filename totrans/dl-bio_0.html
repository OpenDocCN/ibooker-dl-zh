<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>This book introduces you to the fascinating intersection of biology and deep learning. It’s written for both biologists eager to acquire computational skills and computational practitioners curious about applying their expertise to biological problems. This fusion of disciplines is already transforming biotechnology and medicine—and is poised to become foundational across the life sciences.</p>

<p>The material in this book is pitched to be introductory, guiding you from the basics to more intermediate concepts. We aim to balance practical code examples with clear explanations, making new terms and ideas accessible. Real-world Python code appears early and often, helping you develop hands-on intuition. While deep learning is a powerful tool, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution—we emphasize the importance of understanding your data and framing your problem thoughtfully before diving into modeling. We encourage you to start simple, build modular and debuggable code, and add complexity only when it serves a clear purpose.</p>

<p>Although this book is designed for beginners, each chapter builds on the last to develop a practical, end-to-end workflow for applying machine learning to biological data. Our goal is to equip you with tools that are robust enough to solve real-world problems and flexible enough to adapt to your own research questions. In the final chapter, for example, we reproduce key results from a recent <em>Nature Methods</em> paper that uses deep learning to uncover spatial protein patterns in microscopy images.</p>

<p>This field evolves incredibly rapidly—libraries change, datasets get updated, and model architectures come in and out of fashion. The core ideas you’ll learn—how to structure projects, prepare data, build and evaluate models, and connect predictions to biological questions—will remain useful regardless of the framework or trend.</p>

<p>We use the JAX and Flax deep learning ecosystem throughout, helping you build efficient, flexible models using tools that are increasingly popular in machine learning research.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Who This Book Is For"><div class="sect1" id="id389">
<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>

<p>This book is for anyone interested in using deep learning to solve biological problems—whether you’re a biologist, a data scientist, or a software engineer. We have aimed to provide an accessible bridge between disciplines and a practical foundation for working in this emerging field. We’ve designed the book to be user-friendly and interdisciplinary, with the goal of supporting readers from a wide variety of backgrounds.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Why We Wrote This Book"><div class="sect1" id="id108">
<h1>Why We Wrote This Book</h1>

<p>The short answer is that there just aren’t many educational resources for people who want to work at the intersection of biology and machine learning. Most materials either focus heavily on one field or assume deep prior knowledge in both. We set out to write the book we wished we had when we were getting started—something approachable, hands-on, and grounded in real biological problems.</p>

<p>While this book is far from perfect (please do send us your suggestions and extensions), we hope it offers a helpful and motivating starting point—and maybe even inspires some readers to pursue a career in this exciting, fast-moving field.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Prerequisites"><div class="sect1" id="id109">
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<p>We assume a basic familiarity with Python and the core scientific Python libraries—namely, NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. You don’t need to be an expert programmer, but you should feel comfortable reading and writing basic Python code. If you’re new to Python, there are many excellent tutorials and courses available online to help you get started. We particularly recommend the <a href="https://oreil.ly/oLar3">Codecademy Python online course</a>, and the free book <a href="https://oreil.ly/uEGbU"><em>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</em></a> by Al Sweigart.</p>

<p>Some background in machine learning is also helpful. Concepts like optimization, loss functions, training steps, overfitting, and feedforward neural networks will come up frequently. If these are unfamiliar, don’t worry—brief explanations are included throughout the book, and you can always pause to brush up using external resources as needed.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Why We Focus on Molecular Biology"><div class="sect1" id="id110">
<h1>Why We Focus on Molecular Biology</h1>

<p>This book focuses primarily on the “small” side of biology: molecules, cells, and tissues. There are two main reasons for this. First, our backgrounds are in molecular and cellular biology, which naturally influenced the topics we chose. Second, most deep learning applications in biology so far have concentrated on this space, largely due to the availability of large-scale datasets and the quantitative nature of the field.</p>

<p>That said, the techniques and workflows in this book are broadly applicable, and we hope that readers interested in other biological areas—such as ecology, neuroscience, or zoology—will also find inspiration and useful tools here. We’re excited to see deep learning methods continue to spread across the life sciences.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Why All the Hands-on Programming Projects"><div class="sect1" id="id111">
<h1>Why All the Hands-on Programming Projects</h1>

<p>When it comes to machine learning, we believe programming is one of the most effective ways to truly understand what’s going on. Theoretical explanations alone can often feel abstract or confusing—especially when complex notation and dense jargon get involved.</p>

<p>Hands-on projects cut through that by making ideas concrete. They offer several distinct advantages:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Active learning</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Writing code helps reinforce concepts through direct experience.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Deeper understanding</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Implementing a model forces you to understand each component—there’s no room for hand-waving.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Immediate feedback</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>It can be unforgiving, but code that doesn’t work quickly highlights gaps in understanding or setup and invites experimentation.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Practical payoff</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>By the end of a project, you’ll have a functioning model you can analyze, adapt, or apply to new data.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>Theoretical understanding is still essential—but for most people, there’s no substitute for the clarity that comes from building and debugging something yourself.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Notebook Availability"><div class="sect1" id="id112">
<h1>Notebook Availability</h1>

<p>Executable notebooks for each chapter are available on GitHub and can be launched directly in Google Colab. These notebooks are designed to help you follow along with the material in a hands-on way.</p>

<p>We’ll remind you where to find them as you go, but we strongly encourage you to dive in—there’s no better way to learn than by experimenting and getting your hands dirty. If you spot bugs or have suggestions as you explore the code, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue on GitHub.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="O’Reilly Online Learning Platform"><div class="sect1" id="id113">
<h1>O’Reilly Online Learning Platform</h1>

<p>This book is also available through the O’Reilly online learning platform, where you’ll find all figures in full color. The print version is in black and white, and while we’ve done our best to ensure clarity, some visualizations do rely on color to be fully interpretable.</p>

<p>We recommend referring to the digital version when viewing figures that use heatmaps, overlays, or color-coded labels.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Quick Tour of the Book"><div class="sect1" id="id114">
<h1>Quick Tour of the Book</h1>

<p>This is a highly interdisciplinary book built around end-to-end examples of deep learning applications in biology. Each chapter walks you through a self-contained project—from biological background to dataset construction, model training, evaluation, and possible extensions. While some chapters build on earlier ones, most can be read independently based on your interests.</p>

<p>To support learning, each chapter includes a brief biology and machine learning primer relevant to the task at hand. We cover a wide range of biological modalities (e.g., sequences, images, and graphs) and deep learning architectures (e.g., transformers, convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, autoencoders), gradually increasing in complexity.</p>

<p>Here’s a summary of the five main technical chapters to give you a quick sense of the tasks, data types, and techniques explored:</p>
