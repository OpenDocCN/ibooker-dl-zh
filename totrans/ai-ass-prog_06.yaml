    and plugins. Initially launched as a blogging platform, it has expanded to accommodate
    various types of websites, including those optimized for ecommerce, portfolio
    presentation, and general business. Its appeal lies in its user-friendly interface
    and customizable options. A significant portion of the web relies on WordPress;
    W3Techs reports that about [45.8% of all websites on the internet are powered
    by this platform](https://oreil.ly/NiXTW).

    a potential that CodeWP has capitalized on. The company was founded by James LePage,
    who created a WordPress agency during his high school years. Although the business
    experienced rapid growth, it was labor intensive. The introduction of AI-assisted
    programming technology enabled a substantial increase in productivity. A key benefit
