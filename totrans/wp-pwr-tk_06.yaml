    the pendulum swung back the other way, and then got stuck decidedly in a lengthy
    ornate period. Ornamentation, detail, and complexity reigned for centuries. This
    lasted through the Gothic, Baroque, Rococo, Victorian, and even the Art Nouveau
    and Art Deco periods going into the early 20th century. For centuries, architects
    favored intricate details and extensive decorative elements. From embellishments
    such as gargoyles and colorful frescoes and stained-glass windows, to elaborate,

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    was wisely case-insensitive. But committees got together, and the result was that
    CSS was made case-sensitive, unfortunately. So, there are now exceptions to case-insensitivity
    in both HTML and CSS. The code is case-sensitive in several contexts (class names,
    attribute selectors), but it’s frequent enough to cause countless bugs. So, to
    avoid problems, *always use lowercase rather than trying to memorize* the random
    exceptions to the rule.

    The selector is followed by a list of one or more property/value pairs. That entire

    an ordinary HTML element such as `h1`. Or it can be a class name such as `myid`

    and fourth outcroppings, and comes to rest in the lowest pool. If a CSS declaration
    (property-value pair for a particular selector) is redefined during any of these
    bumps, that new redefinition is the one used, the one that “wins.” In other words,
    each lower outcropping in the cascade can redefine (overrule and change) any CSS
    style that was previously defined by an earlier outcropping.

    A keyframe can specify when something begins to move, changes direction, resizes,
    and so on. Keyframes can be set for things such as position, rotation, scale,
    and so on. Between two keyframes (or a keyframe and the end of the sequence),
    the animation software will automatically interpolate the values to create smooth
    transitions.

    keyframes. You can just say, rotate for 1 second, rather than specifying each

    technique to specify timing, pacing, transformations, and other animation effects.

    (usually).

- en: Tip When describing how to use Gutenberg, the term *usually* pops up fairly
    often. Even after years of work, the talented people at WordPress are still polishing
    this work in progress. To me, Gutenberg is a worthy goal that will be achieved
    one day. For now, there are workarounds you must memorize, as the rest of this
    section illustrates. I look forward to switching from the classic WordPress editor
    to Gutenberg when the latter stabilizes and is relatively free of bugs. But my
    hope is that switching between the classic and block editors will be possible
    via a single mouse click. Each editor has its strengths.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in the Additional CSS screen. For now, though, let’s see how to add *inline* CSS
    locally using Gutenberg—adding CSS to a single HTML element such as paragraph
    body text (HTML element `<p>)`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    inline CSS code! Go to the Pages > All Pages screen, and click a page title to
    get to its Edit Page screen. Click + to add a C*lassic* block (*not* the Paragraph
    block) to the page, and type `This is a paragraph`, into that block.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to run into difficulties, that is, bugs. After you add the CSS using code view,
    preview the page, and then click Edit Page to return to the editor, Gutenberg
    posts an error message claiming that Unexpected or Invalid Content is in your
    block. That’s untrue—the content is both as expected and valid. Then, Gutenberg
    offers to fix the problem by displaying an Attempt Block Recovery button. This
    “fix” simply deletes the block! It’s as if you go to the dentist to fix a tooth,
    and the dentist shoots you.

    better than one, you can also apply CSS classes to a block using a special Advanced
    module. As mentioned previously, adding `class=` via inline CSS works fine to
    apply a class rule to an HTML element such as a heading or body text. You just
    define a class in the Additional CSS screen as usual, and then type `<h1` `class="classname">headline</h1>`
    in the HTML element.

    the right (usually, not always). Click the Block tab in the sidebar.

    must first change the Classic block into a block (paradoxical, isn’t it?). To
    do that, you click Convert to Blocks displayed in the Classic block’s top toolbar
    (there are two toolbars, one above the other). You logically thought that the
    Classic block *was* a block, but never mind. The Classic—let’s call it a pseudoblock—has
    to be converted to a real block before you can access the sidebar and its Advanced
    module. All this isn’t really worth the trouble. It’s easier to just type in the
    `block=` attribute by hand yourself using the code view option. That way you can

    site’s look can be honed, giving it an appearance that is both unlike other sites
    and also in tune with your site’s purpose.

    other things, learning the basics of CSS and how CSS modifies and interacts with
    the HTML code that underpins the display of web pages.

- en: You need not learn the CSS language because there is a powerful plugin called
    YellowPencil that automatically generates CSS for you. You use sliders, color
    wheels, and other high-level WYSIWYG tools to fine-tune a page’s design, and then
    YellowPencil creates the CSS by itself. Also, AI systems such as Claude ([https://claude.ai](https://claude.ai))
    are increasingly skilled at programming, CSS included.

- en: Outpainting means you can extend one or more of the sides of an image. This
    is the opposite of cropping, which trims one or more of the edges. Cropping has
    been used for centuries. But outpainting only became possible when AI appeared.
    The extensions of the image must blend in with the rest of the image, but they
    must also be original and a variation. It can’t just be a copy. Human artists
    can do this, but prior to AI, no computer could.
