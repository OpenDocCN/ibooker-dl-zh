    them being loaded into the first neuron, but the values are loaded into just each
    of them. Also, consider each neuron’s weight and bias (*w* and *b*) to be randomly
    initialized. Then, when we sum up the values of the output of each neuron, we’re
    going to get a value. We’ll do this for *every* neuron in the output layer, so
    neuron 0 will contain the value of the probability that the pixels will add up
    to label 0, neuron 1 will contain the value of the probability that the pixels
    will add up to label 1, etc.

    on that 10%. And thus, over time, the computer will learn to “see” what makes
    a shoe a shoe or a dress a dress. You’ll see this process of improvement when
    you run the code and your neural network effectively learns to distinguish the

    that we want 128 of them. The *input* shape is defined as (28 × 28), which is

    that it’s in the middle of the diagram. This is because we also drew the data
    “coming in” to this layer. One other thing to note is that image data from datasets
    like Fashion MNIST is usually rectangular in shape, but a layer doesn’t recognize
    that, so it will need to be “flattened” into a 1-D array, as shown across the

    parameters randomly initialized. Often, the question I’ll get asked at this point
    is “Why 128?” This is entirely arbitrary—there’s no fixed rule for the number
    of neurons to use. As you design the layers, you want to pick the appropriate
    number of values to enable your model to actually learn. More neurons means it
    will run more slowly, as it has to learn more parameters. More neurons could also
    lead to a network that is great at recognizing the training data but not so good
    at recognizing data that it hasn’t previously seen. (This is known as *overfitting*,
    and we’ll discuss it later in this chapter). On the other hand, fewer neurons
    means that the model might not have sufficient parameters to learn.

    of learning and do some experimentation over time to pick the right values. This
    process is typically called *hyperparameter tuning*. In ML, a *hyperparameter*

    of the neurons that get trained/learned, which are referred to as *parameters*.

- en: When you’re defining a neural network with PyTorch and using the `Sequential`,
    you don’t just define the layers of the network and what types of neurons they
    may use. You can also define functions that execute on the data while it flows
    between the neural network layers. These are typically called *activation functions*,
    and an activation function is the next thing you see specified in the code as
    `nn.ReLU()`. An activation function is code that will execute on each neuron in
    the layer. PyTorch supports a number of activation functions out of the box, and
    a very common one in middle layers is `ReLU`, which stands for *rectified linear
    unit*. It’s a simple function that returns a value only if it’s greater than 0\.
    In this case, we don’t want negative values being passed to the next layer to
    potentially impact the summing function, so instead of writing a lot of `if-then`
    code, we can simply activate the layer with `ReLU`.

    If you look at the defined shape of (128, 10) and think of it through that “input
    size, output size” framework, you’ll see that it has 128 “inputs” (i.e., the number
    of neurons in the layer above) and 10 “outputs.” What are these 10? Recall that
    Fashion MNIST has 10 classes of clothing. Each of these neurons is effectively
    assigned one class, and it will end up with a probability that the input pixels
    match that class, so our job is to determine which one has the highest value.
    You might wonder how these assignments happen: where is the code that says one
    neuron is for a shoe and another is for a shirt? To answer that question, recall
    the *y* = 2*x* ‒ 1 example in [Chapter 1](ch01.html#ch01_introduction_to_pytorch_1748548870019566),
    where we had a set of input data and a set of known, correct answers that is sometimes
    called the *ground truth*. Fashion MNIST will work in the same way. When training
    the network, we provide the input images *and* their known answers as a set of
    what we want the output neurons to look like. Thus, the network will “learn” that
    when it sees a shoe, the output neurons that don’t represent that shoe should
    have a zero value and the ones that do should have a “1” value.'

    at understanding the difference between a subset of shoes and shirts, but it will
    do poorly when new data is presented to it. So, it’s good practice to always hold
    back a little of your data and *not* train the neural network with it. In this

    in between being shades of gray. To prepare the data for the neural network, we
    should map these shades to values between 0 and 1\. The preceding code will automatically
    do that for you in PyTorch, so applying this `transform` parameter as you’re loading
    the code will then map the pixel values from the [0, 255] integer range to a [0,

    learn more about optimization algorithms over time, and you’ll be able to choose
    from the menu of optimizers that fit your scenario best. One important thing here
    is to note that I’ve passed in `model.parameters()` as a parameter to this. This

    that it can adjust them to help minimize the loss calculated by the loss function.

    outputs 10 values, each of which includes the probability of the class it represents
    being the correct one. Calling `argmax` on this will give us which one had the
    biggest value (i.e., the one with the probability closest to 1). The *y* value
    is the correct answer. For example, if we get a prediction, the neuron with the
    highest value is the sixth one, and *y* = 6, so we know we have a correct answer.
    Also, because we’re dealing in batches, we want to count each time `pred.argmax(1)
    == y` for this batch, hence, the `sum()`.

    how to match the inputs it has been trained on with the outputs for those values.
    Our hope is that given enough data, the network will be able to generalize from
    the examples it has seen and thus “learn” what a shoe or a dress looks like. But
    there will always be examples of items that it hasn’t seen that are also different
    enough from what it has seen to confuse it.'

    better with the training data, but the model is not necessarily a better model.
    In fact, the divergence in the accuracy numbers shows that the model might have
    become overspecialized to the training data, in a process that’s often called
