    concepts to computer vision. In this process, a model learns how to recognize
    content in pictures so it can “see” what’s in them. You’ll work with a popular
    dataset of clothing items and build a model that can differentiate between them
    and thus “see” the difference between different types of clothing.

    with lots of different varieties of the same item. Take a look at the two shoes—they’re

    them being loaded into the first neuron, but the values are loaded into just each
    of them. Also, consider each neuron’s weight and bias (*w* and *b*) to be randomly
    initialized. Then, when we sum up the values of the output of each neuron, we’re
    going to get a value. We’ll do this for *every* neuron in the output layer, so
    neuron 0 will contain the value of the probability that the pixels will add up
    to label 0, neuron 1 will contain the value of the probability that the pixels
    will add up to label 1, etc.

    on that 10%. And thus, over time, the computer will learn to “see” what makes
    a shoe a shoe or a dress a dress. You’ll see this process of improvement when
    you run the code and your neural network effectively learns to distinguish the

    shape is effectively the number of neurons you want in this layer, and we’re specifying
    that we want 128 of them. The *input* shape is defined as (28 × 28), which is

    just means that there’s no direct interface to that layer. This takes a little
    bit of getting used to—the middle layer is the first layer that you *define*,
    and in a diagram like [Figure 2-5](#ch02_figure_5_1748548889066432), you can see
    that it’s in the middle of the diagram. This is because we also drew the data
    “coming in” to this layer. One other thing to note is that image data from datasets
    like Fashion MNIST is usually rectangular in shape, but a layer doesn’t recognize
    that, so it will need to be “flattened” into a 1-D array, as shown across the

    parameters randomly initialized. Often, the question I’ll get asked at this point
    is “Why 128?” This is entirely arbitrary—there’s no fixed rule for the number
    of neurons to use. As you design the layers, you want to pick the appropriate
    number of values to enable your model to actually learn. More neurons means it
    will run more slowly, as it has to learn more parameters. More neurons could also
    lead to a network that is great at recognizing the training data but not so good
    at recognizing data that it hasn’t previously seen. (This is known as *overfitting*,
    and we’ll discuss it later in this chapter). On the other hand, fewer neurons
    means that the model might not have sufficient parameters to learn.

    of learning and do some experimentation over time to pick the right values. This

    of the neurons that get trained/learned, which are referred to as *parameters*.

- en: When you’re defining a neural network with PyTorch and using the `Sequential`,
    you don’t just define the layers of the network and what types of neurons they
    may use. You can also define functions that execute on the data while it flows
    between the neural network layers. These are typically called *activation functions*,
    and an activation function is the next thing you see specified in the code as
    `nn.ReLU()`. An activation function is code that will execute on each neuron in
    the layer. PyTorch supports a number of activation functions out of the box, and
    a very common one in middle layers is `ReLU`, which stands for *rectified linear
    unit*. It’s a simple function that returns a value only if it’s greater than 0\.
    In this case, we don’t want negative values being passed to the next layer to
    potentially impact the summing function, so instead of writing a lot of `if-then`
    code, we can simply activate the layer with `ReLU`.

    If you look at the defined shape of (128, 10) and think of it through that “input
    size, output size” framework, you’ll see that it has 128 “inputs” (i.e., the number
    of neurons in the layer above) and 10 “outputs.” What are these 10? Recall that
    Fashion MNIST has 10 classes of clothing. Each of these neurons is effectively
    assigned one class, and it will end up with a probability that the input pixels
    match that class, so our job is to determine which one has the highest value.
    You might wonder how these assignments happen: where is the code that says one
    neuron is for a shoe and another is for a shirt? To answer that question, recall
    the *y* = 2*x* ‒ 1 example in [Chapter 1](ch01.html#ch01_introduction_to_pytorch_1748548870019566),
    where we had a set of input data and a set of known, correct answers that is sometimes
    called the *ground truth*. Fashion MNIST will work in the same way. When training
    the network, we provide the input images *and* their known answers as a set of
    what we want the output neurons to look like. Thus, the network will “learn” that
    when it sees a shoe, the output neurons that don’t represent that shoe should
    have a zero value and the ones that do should have a “1” value.'

- en: '[PRE3]`Let’s walk through this piece by piece. First, let’s consider where
    the data comes from. In the torchvision library, there’s a datasets collection,
    and we can load Fashion MNIST from that, addressed as follows:    [PRE4]    So,
    in our first block of code, you’ll see these:    [PRE5]    Now, you might wonder
    why we’re using *two* datasets. It’s simple: one is for training, and one is for
    testing. The idea here is also simple: if you train a neural network on a set
    of data, it can become an expert on *that* set of data, but it may not be effective
    at understanding or classifying *other* data that it previously has not seen.
    In the case of Fashion MNIST, it might become excellent at understanding the difference
    between a subset of shoes and shirts, but it will do poorly when new data is presented
    to it. So, it’s good practice to always hold back a little of your data and *not*
    train the neural network with it. In this case, Fashion MNIST has 70,000 items
    of data, but only 60,000 of them are used to train the network and the other 10,000
    are used to test it. If you look at the preceding code carefully, you’ll see that
    the difference between the two lines is the `train=` parameter. For the first
    one, the training set the parameter is set to True. For the other, it’s set to
    False.    You’ll also see the `transform` parameter in the datasets. It specifies
    a transformation to apply to the data, which was defined like this:    [PRE6]    Neural
    networks typically work with *normalized* values (i.e., those between 0 and 1).
    However, the pixels in our image are in the range of 0–255, and the values indicate
    their color depth, with 0 being black, 255 being white, and everything in between
    being shades of gray. To prepare the data for the neural network, we should map
    these shades to values between 0 and 1\. The preceding code will automatically
    do that for you in PyTorch, so applying this `transform` parameter as you’re loading
    the code will then map the pixel values from the [0, 255] integer range to a [0,
    1] floating-point range and load them into an array that’s suitable for the neural
    network (aka a Tensor).    Our job will be to fit the training images to the training
    labels in a manner that’s similar to how we fit *y* to *x* in [Chapter 1](ch01.html#ch01_introduction_to_pytorch_1748548870019566).    The
    math for [why normalized data is better for training neural networks](https://oreil.ly/6d_Po)
    is beyond the scope of this book, but bear in mind that when you’re training a
    neural network in PyTorch, normalization will improve performance. Often, your
    network will not learn and will have massive errors when dealing with nonnormalized
    data. You’ll recall that the *y* = 2*x* – 1 example from [Chapter 1](ch01.html#ch01_introduction_to_pytorch_1748548870019566)
    didn’t require the data to be normalized because it was very simple, but for fun,
    try training it with different values of *x* and *y* where *x* is much larger—and
    you’ll see it quickly fail!    Next, we define the neural network that makes up
    our model, as discussed earlier, but we’ll flesh it out with a bit more detail—including
    the flattening layers and how we want the “forward” pass to work in the model.    Here’s
    the code:    [PRE7]    Some key things to note here are that the `FashionMNISTModel`
    class subclasses `nn.Module`, which gives you the ability to override its `forward`
    method. We use this method when data is passing forward through the network. Remember
    back in [Chapter 1](ch01.html#ch01_introduction_to_pytorch_1748548870019566) when
    we saw the `loss.backward()` call that did backpropagation and changed the parameters
    of the network? You’ll frequently encounter that same pattern when training models
    with PyTorch. You’ll define functions to execute as the data moves *forward* through
    the network, and then you’ll define others to execute as the gradients that we
    calculate from the loss move *backward* through the network.    So, if we look
    at the `init` for the class, we define two methods: `flatten`, which is set to
    `nn.FLatten()` (a built-in function to flatten the 2D image to 1D), and `lin⁠ear​_relu_stack`,
    which is set to the sequence of layers and operations (often abbreviated to *ops*)
    that define the behavior of the network.    In `forward`, we then simply define
    how these work. First, we flatten our data, `x`, by calling `self.flatten`, and
    then the results will be passed into `linear_relu_stack` to get the results. The
    results are called *logits*, which are log probabilities (as defined by `LogSoftmax`)
    that indicate the confidence the model has that each class is the correct classification.    To
    learn from our data, we need a loss function to calculate how good or bad our
    current “guess” is, and we also need an optimizer to figure out the next set of
    parameters for an improved guess.    Here’s an example of how to define both:    [PRE8]    First,
    let’s look at the loss function. It’s defined as `nn.NLLLoss(),` which stands
    for “Negative Log Likelihood Loss.” Don’t worry—nobody expects you to understand
    what that means at this point! Ultimately, as you work through learning how to
    do ML, you’ll learn about different loss functions, and you’ll experiment with
    which ones work well in particular scenarios. In this case, given that the output
    logits are log probabilities, I chose this loss function because it works particularly
    well for this scenario. As mentioned, over time, you’ll learn a lot more about
    the library of loss functions, and you can choose the best ones for your scenario.
    But for now, just go with the flow and use this one!    For the optimizer, I’ve
    opted to use the `Adam` optimization algorithm. It’s similar to the stochastic
    gradient descent that we used for the *y* = 2*x* – 1 model in [Chapter 1](ch01.html#ch01_introduction_to_pytorch_1748548870019566),
    but it’s generally faster and more accurate. As with the loss function, you’ll
    learn more about optimization algorithms over time, and you’ll be able to choose
    from the menu of optimizers that fit your scenario best. One important thing here
    is to note that I’ve passed in `model.parameters()` as a parameter to this. This
    parameter passes all the trainable parameters in the model to the optimizer so
    that it can adjust them to help minimize the loss calculated by the loss function.    Now,
    let’s get down to the specifics and explore what the code we use for training
    the network looks like:    [PRE9]    While some of this will look familiar because
    it builds on the simple neural network from [Chapter 1](ch01.html#ch01_introduction_to_pytorch_1748548870019566),
    there are a few new concepts here, given that we’re using much more data. First,
    you’ll see that we get the `size` of the dataset. We simply use this to report
    on progress, as shown in the very last line.    Then, we call `model.train` to
    explicitly set the model into training mode. PyTorch has optimizations that occur
    during training that are beyond the scope of this chapter. (To take advantage
    of them, you’ll switch the model between training and inference modes.) Note that
    this is more a property of the model than a method, but the method syntax is there.
    Sorry if it’s a little confusing!    Next up is this interesting line:    [PRE10]    Let’s
    explore this in a little more detail. We made the Fashion MNIST dataset available
    to our code by using a data loader. There are 60,000 records available for training,
    each of which is 784 pixels. That’s a lot of data, and you don’t necessarily need
    all of it in memory at once. The idea of a `batch` is to take a chunk of that
    data—which, by default, is 64 items—and work with it. Enumerating the data loader
    gives us that, so we’ll train with 938 batches, 937 of 64, and the last one of
    32 because you can’t evenly divide 60,000 by 64!    Now, for each batch, we’ll
    go through the same loop that we saw for the previous example. We’ll get the predictions
    from the model, calculate the loss, backpropagate the gradients from the loss
    function, and optimize with new parameters.    We’ll also use the term *epoch*
    for a training cycle with *all* of the data (i.e., every batch). We can then output
    the status of the training every one hundred batches so as not to overload the
    output console!    So, to train the network for five epochs, we can use code like
    this:    [PRE11]    This will simply call the train function we specified five
    times—putting the network through the training loop by calculating the predictions,
    figuring out the loss, optimizing the parameters, and repeating five times.[PRE12]``  [PRE13][PRE14]``py[PRE15]
