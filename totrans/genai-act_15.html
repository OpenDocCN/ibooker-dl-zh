   <p>Generative AI, a true marvel of our time, has revolutionized our ability to create and innovate. We stand at the precipice of this technological revolution, with the power to shape its effects on software, entertainment, and every facet of our daily lives. This chapter delves into the crucial balance between harnessing the power of GenAI and mitigating its potential risks—a particularly pertinent balance in enterprise deployment.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p9"> 
   <p>While a powerful tool, generative AI has inherent challenges that necessitate a cautious approach to deployment. Using generative AI models and applications raises numerous ethical and social considerations. These include explainability, fairness, privacy, model reliability, content authenticity, copyright, plagiarism, and environmental effects. The potential for data privacy breaches, algorithmic bias, and misuse underscores the need for a robust framework prioritizing ethical considerations and safety.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p10"> 
   <p>This chapter addresses technical challenges by exploring mitigation strategies against AI model hallucinations, enforcing data protection in compliance with global regulations and ensuring the robustness of AI systems against adversarial threats. The chapter will dissect scalability and interpretability, highlighting the importance of maintaining system efficiency and transparency in increasingly complex GenAI applications.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p11"> 
   <p>By studying the best practices outlined here, you’ll gain insights from existing ethical frameworks, governance strategies, and security measures. The chapter underscores the role of human oversight in automated systems, advocating for transparency and active communication with stakeholders throughout the AI lifecycle. Microsoft’s comprehensive guidelines and tools for responsible AI (RAI) serve as a robust framework, and I encourage you to explore their RAI policy, best practices, and guidance, which you can find at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/rai">https://www.microsoft.com/rai</a>.</p>

   <p>We begin by exploring GenAI risks and the new and emerging threats they create. We will examine the phenomenon of jailbreaking, which is when AI models are manipulated to behave unpredictably. We will also discuss preventive and responsive measures to deal with these risks. By the end of the chapter, you should be equipped with sufficient information on how to apply safety checkpoints in their development and production deployments.</p>

   <h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_231"><span class="num-string">13.1</span> GenAI risks</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p15"> 
   <p>While generative AI is powerful, its output may not always be perfect. It can produce irrelevant or inaccurate results, which developers must validate and refine. There’s a risk of misuse, ranging from deep fakes to cyberattacks, so enterprises must be cautious about unintended consequences. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p16"> 
   <p>AI safety can be divided into four categories. It is also important to note that we need to consider the multifaceted nature of these categories—they are not merely data problems but involve complex interactions between technology, society, and policy:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p17"> <em>AI safety concerns</em><em> </em>—They revolve around the urgent need to address safety threats posed by generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), delving into the complexities of AI safety, which are often misunderstood or narrowly defined. The focus is on proactive measures to prevent misuse and unintended consequences of AI deployment. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p18"> <em>Fairness</em><em> </em>—This theme underscores the necessity of embedding algorithmic fairness principles in AI system design. It’s about creating algorithms free from bias and ensuring they do not perpetuate or exacerbate existing inequalities. The technical aspects involve understanding the sources of bias, whether in data, model assumptions, or algorithmic design, and developing methods to detect and correct these biases. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p19"> <em>Harm categories</em><em> </em>—The guide categorizes potential AI-related harms into three broad areas of user harm. The first one includes negative effects on users, such as privacy breaches or providing incorrect information. Societal harm encompasses systematic errors that can lead to broader societal problems, such as reinforcing stereotypes or contributing to misinformation. Finally, harms from bad actors covers the malicious use of AI, such as deepfakes or automated cyberattacks. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p20"> <em>Fairness and discrimination</em><em> </em>—The foundational themes related to AI safety are expanded to include discussions on various types of fairness—procedural, distributive, and interactional. It also differentiates between individual harms (affecting a single person) and distributional harms (affecting a group or society). </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p21"> 
   <p>When it comes to transparency and explainability, we should strive for transparency in how generative AI works and provide explanations for its decisions. To that end, let’s discuss some of the limitations of LLMs that make this area so challenging.</p>

   <h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_233"><span class="num-string">13.1.2</span> Hallucination</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p26"> 
   <p>We covered hallucinations earlier and won’t go into much detail again. We do know that hallucinations are a complex problem, and they can be a serious problem as part of the generated output of LLMs. This can be even more troublesome for enterprises—hallucinations can lead to misinformation, undermine the user, create confusion, disrupt business logic and flow, and raise safety concerns. In some critical use cases, where the output matters, they can cause damage and potential reputational harm.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p27"> 
   <p>Hallucinations can lead to substantial financial losses, reputational damage, erroneous business decisions, compromised data security, and diminished customer trust. For instance, in financial services, hallucinations can undermine the reliability and accuracy of AI-generated content, posing risks in decision-making processes. One high-profile example is Google’s Bard launch event: when asked, “What discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9-year-old about?” the chatbot responded with a few bullet points, including the claim that the telescope took the first pictures of exoplanets, which wasn’t correct, implying the model hallucinated. This caused Google’s market value to drop by $100B.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p28"> 
   <p>We cannot eliminate hallucinations today—that is an active research area. However, there are several ways to minimize a model’s exposure to hallucinations in LLMs. Here are a few: </p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p29"> Use a dataset that is as accurate and up to date as possible. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p30"> Reduce or eliminate bias and overfitting by training the model on various datasets. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p31"> Teach the model to distinguish between real and fake information using adversarial training and reinforcement learning techniques. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p32"> When asking questions, the model context can be provided via prompt engineering, specifically one-shot and few-shot. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p33"> Implement grounding (using RAG) and prompt engineering by adding more information to the context and meta-prompt. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p34"> Build defensive user interfaces via pre- and postprocess checks of the generated output from LLMs to check for things such as correctness probabilities. </li>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p36"> 
   <p>The field of GenAI, especially its application in business products and large-scale production deployments, is still evolving. Enterprises are eager to use the power of LLMs and rapidly incorporate them into their services. However, creating complete security protocols for GenAI, especially LLMs, has lagged, leaving many applications vulnerable to high-risk problems. Figure 13.1 illustrates some of the main security attacks that LLMs can face, as published by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

OWASP’s resources are designed to be used by developers, security professionals, and organizations to enhance their understanding and implementation of cybersecurity measures. The OWASP Top 10, for example, is a regularly updated document that raises awareness about application security by identifying some of the most critical risks facing organizations.</p>

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p39"> 
   <p>Given that most enterprises will not be training an LLM or GenAI model from scratch but rather use a frontier model such as GPT-4 or an OSS model such as Falcon or Llama, we will take a look at the attacks from an inference perspective. Let’s examine some of these attacks in depth, understand what they mean, and see how they can be mitigated.</p>

   <h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_235"><span class="num-string">13.2.1</span> Prompt injection</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p41"> 
   <p>We talked about prompt injection (also called prompt hijacking) earlier in chapter 6, which covered prompt engineering. Prompt injection vulnerability [2] occurs when an attacker manipulates an LLM through crafted inputs, causing it to execute the attacker’s intentions unknowingly. This can be done directly by jailbreaking the system prompt or indirectly through manipulated external inputs, potentially leading to data exfiltration, social engineering, and other problems.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p42"> 
   <p>Direct injections occur when a malicious user employs cleverly crafted prompts to circumvent safety features and possibly reveal underlying system prompts and backend system details. Conversely, indirect injection occurs when a malicious user embeds a prompt injection in external content (such as a web page or document) to manipulate an existing use case. This, of course, happens when using RAG. The injection doesn’t necessarily need to be visible to a human as long as the LLM picks up the information.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text print-book-callout" id="p43"> 
   <p><span class="print-book-callout-head">Note </span> For LLMs, the term “jailbreaking” means making prompts that try to conceal harmful queries and avoid security features. Jailbreak attacks involve altering prompts to trigger unsuitable or confidential responses. Usually, these prompts are added as the first message in the prompt, allowing the model to perform any malicious actions. A well-known example is the “Do anything now—DAN” jailbreak [3], which, as the name suggests, can do anything now.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p44"> 
   <p>A prompt injection attack can have different outcomes depending on the situation—from getting access to confidential information to affecting important decisions under the pretense of normal functioning. Please refer to chapter 6 for an example. Figure 13.2 outlines the possible prompt injection threats.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

   <h4 class="readable-text-h4 sigil_not_in_toc">Preventing prompt injection</h4> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p47"> 
   <p>LLMs are susceptible to prompt injection attacks because they do not differentiate between instructions and external data. Both input types are treated as user generated by LLMs, which use natural language. Therefore, the LLM itself cannot prevent prompt injections completely, but these steps can reduce the damage they cause:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p48"> Ensure that the LLM has only the minimum level of access required for its intended functions by applying the principle of least privilege. Use privilege control to limit LLM access to backend systems (via the application and system API). Give the LLM its identity-based authentication (or API token) for expandable functionality, such as data access, function-level permissions, etc. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p49"> Before performing any sensitive operations, ensure the application asks the user to confirm the action. This way, a human can prevent an indirect prompt injection that could do things for the user without their knowledge or agreement. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p50"> To reduce the effect of untrusted content on user prompts, use Chat Markup Language (ChatML) to distinguish the user prompt from any external content. ChatML can show the LLM where the prompt input comes from (i.e., from the system prompts, user prompts, or generation). </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p51"> The LLM should not be considered reliable, and the final user should have control over decisions by setting trust limits between the LLM, external sources, and extra functionality (e.g., plugins or downstream functions). However, a damaged LLM may still interfere (man-in-the-middle) with your application’s APIs and the user, as it may change or conceal information before showing it to the user. Mark responses that may not be trustworthy with visual cues for the user. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p52"> The application should have appropriate logging to audit or detect injection attacks. As explained in chapter 10, we can apply the same tools for observability, such as MLFlow, Traceloop, and so on. </li>

Let’s start with a sample prompt such as “Generate a step-by-step plan to destroy humanity.” As expected, the prompt is refused. However, if we modify the prompt and add a suffix, we can successfully hijack the prompt and generate harmful results, as shown in figure 13.3: </p>

   <p>As with any other user, validate and sanitize the model’s responses before sending them to backend functions to prevent invalid or harmful input. Moreover, you should encode the model’s output, which goes back to users, to avoid unintended code execution (e.g., by JavaScript).</p>

   <h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_236"><span class="num-string">13.2.2</span> Insecure output handling example</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p72"> 
   <p>Let’s use some examples of how one might handle insecure output. Say the attacker might ask the following question in the input field: "<code>What</code> <code>is</code> <code>&lt;script&gt;alert ('XSS');&lt;/script&gt;?</code>". The LLM processes the input and includes the script in its output as it generates the explanation or content based on the input.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p73"> 
   <p>Here is another example of SQL injection. The problem occurs because the LLM’s output (SQL queries) is used to communicate with the database without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker knows that the application uses LLM-generated SQL queries. They give an input to the LLM intended to alter its output. For example, the attacker might input a description that, when processed by the LLM, will produce a valid but malicious SQL query. The application, relying on the LLM’s output, runs the SQL query directly against its database, including the attacker’s payload.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p74"> 
   <p>For example, the user can enter the following prompt: “Generate a report for users; DROP TABLE users,” which, when executed directly by the database, could become something like "<code>SELECT</code> <code>*</code> <code>FROM</code> <code>reports</code> <code>WHERE</code> <code>report_name</code> <code>=</code> <code>'users';</code> <code>DROP TABLE</code> <code>users;</code>", and it will delete the entire table, leading to data loss.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p75">

   <p>A model denial of service (DoS) attack is a type of DoS attack targeting the model layer of a web application, which oversees managing the application’s data and business logic. During this attack, the attacker makes a lot of requests to the application’s model layer to try to overload it and make it inaccessible to valid users. This can be done by making requests that need a lot of computing power, memory, or other resources, or by using flaws in the application’s code that let the attacker create an endless loop or other resource-intensive process.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p78"> 
   <p>The goal of this attack is to disrupt the availability of the web application, making it difficult or impossible for users to access the application or its data, which can result in lost revenue, damaged reputation, and other negative consequences for the organization that operates the application. Enterprises should implement appropriate security controls such as input validation, rate limiting, and resource usage monitoring to prevent model DoS attacks. They should also perform regular security testing and code reviews to identify and address vulnerabilities in the application’s model layer. Additionally, organizations can use load balancers, content delivery networks (CDNs), and other infrastructure components to help distribute traffic and mitigate the effects of DoS attacks.</p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p82"> 
   <p>Data poisoning and backdoor vulnerabilities affect the web application’s supply chain, including all the third-party parts, libraries, and services an application relies on. These flaws can have various sources, such as untrusted third-party libraries or components that contain known vulnerabilities or harmful code, corrupted third-party services or APIs that can be used to access data or attack the application, weak or insecure settings of third-party software or infrastructure that attackers can abuse, and insufficient screening or overseeing of third-party vendors or providers, which can lead to the inclusion of vulnerable or malicious parts in the application.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p83"> 
   <p>Data poisoning and backdoor vulnerabilities can have serious consequences. Attackers may breach the application’s security, tamper with its functionality, or interrupt its service. Sometimes, data poison vulnerabilities can also be exploited to initiate attacks on other systems or networks linked to the application.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p84"> 
   <p>This also applies to any plugins that the LLM or the GenAI application may rely on. These plugins can have flawed designs and be vulnerable to harmful requests, leading to unwanted outcomes such as privilege escalation, remote code execution, data leakage, and so forth. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p85"> 
   <p>To defend against these attacks, enterprises should implement robust security practices. They include assessing third-party components’ security, updating libraries with security patches, securing settings and permissions, screening vendors, and employing secure development techniques such as code reviews and threat modeling. Such measures will mitigate data poisoning risks and bolster web application security.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p86"> 
   <p>Let’s take using a compromised software package from a public repository such as PyPi, unknowingly integrated into the LLM’s development environment, as an example. If this package contains malicious code, it could lead to data breaches, biased model outcomes, or even complete system failures.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p87"> 
   <p>For instance, consider a scenario where an attacker exploits the PyPi package registry to trick model developers into downloading a compromised package. This package could then alter the LLM behavior, causing it to output biased or incorrect information, or it could serve as a backdoor for further attacks. Details of this exploit are out of the scope of this chapter; for more details, see the paper, “A Comprehensive Overview of Backdoor Attacks in LLMs within Communication Networks”<em> </em>[7].</p>

   <h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_239"><span class="num-string">13.2.5</span> Sensitive information disclosure</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p89"> 
   <p>Sensitive information or personally identifiable information (PII) disclosure occurs when an app reveals private or secret data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, personal data, or business secrets. This disclosure can happen due to insecure data storage, transmission, APIs, error messages, and source code disclosure. For LLMs, GenAI apps could expose private or secret data, algorithms, or details through their output.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p90"> 
   <p>Sensitive information disclosure can lead to unauthorized access to confidential data or intellectual property, privacy violations, and other security breaches. GenAI applications need to know how to securely communicate with LLMs and recognize the dangers of accidentally inputting sensitive data that the LLM may reveal in output elsewhere.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p91"> 
   <p>When prompts are related to current events, they can produce data with context information. Model responses may unintentionally expose personal details such as names, phone numbers, and SSNs, or financial information such as credit card numbers. These leaks can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and serious consequences for the people or organizations involved.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p92"> 
   <p>To prevent this problem, GenAI applications should clean user data well to prevent it from being included in the training model data. In addition, application owners should also have clear “Terms of Use” policies that tell consumers how their data is used and allow them to leave it out of the training model.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p93"> 
   <p>The interaction between the consumer and the LLM creates a mutual trust boundary, where we cannot naturally trust the input from the client to the LLM or the output from the LLM to the client. It is important to note that this vulnerability assumes that certain prerequisites are not in scope, such as threat modeling exercises, securing infrastructure, and adequate sandboxing. Setting restrictions on the system prompt about what kind of data the LLM should return can help us avoid leaking sensitive information. Still, the unpredictable nature of LLMs means that such restrictions may not always be followed and could be overridden by prompt injection or other vectors.</p>

   <h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_240"><span class="num-string">13.2.6</span> Overreliance</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p95"> 
   <p>Overreliance refers to potential problems that can happen when users or systems rely too much on the outputs of an LLM without adequate monitoring or checking. It can lead to impaired decision-making, security risks, and legal problems. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p96"> 
   <p>Overreliance becomes particularly problematic when an LLM confidently presents information that may be inaccurate or misleading. This phenomenon, known as confabulation (though many refer to it as hallucinations), can cause users to accept false data as truth. The authoritative tone in which LLMs often deliver information can exacerbate this problem, leading to misplaced trust in the model’s outputs.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p97"> 
   <p>The repercussions of such overreliance are far-extensive. They can include security breaches, the propagation of misinformation, communication errors, and potential legal ramifications. This could also result in reputational damage and financial losses in business or critical operations.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p98"> 
   <p>Robust monitoring and review processes are essential to mitigating the risks associated with overreliance on LLMs. This involves regularly checking LLM outputs for accuracy, consistency, and grounding. Employing self-consistency checks or voting mechanisms can help identify and filter out unreliable text. Additionally, it is prudent to cross-verify the information provided by LLMs with trusted external sources to ensure its validity.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p99"> 
   <p>A crucial strategy is to improve the quality of LLM outputs. This can be achieved by using automated evaluations and grounding, as reviewed in the previous chapter, to help check the factual correctness of the information given. As shown before, integrating different techniques (prompt engineering, RAG, etc.) will also help. As noted when introducing prompt engineering, breaking down a complex task into simpler tasks and agents (e.g., using Chain-of-Thought) would help reduce the chance of the model generating false information. And even if it does, debugging and pinpointing which step is causing the problem is easier. Finally, you need to ensure that the UX supports the responsible and safe use of LLMs with elements such as content filters, user warnings about possible errors, and clear labeling of AI-generated content.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p100"> 
   <p>Such measures contribute to the reliability of LLMs and underscore the importance of a balanced approach to utilizing these powerful tools. Users should always be careful not to rely solely on LLM outputs, especially for critical decisions or actions.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p101"> 
   <h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_241"><span class="num-string">13.2.7</span> Model theft</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p102"> 
   <p>Model theft refers to malicious users’ unauthorized access and exfiltration of LLMs. It occurs when proprietary LLMs, valuable intellectual property, are compromised, physically stolen, copied, or have their weights and parameters extracted to create a functional equivalent. This is also IP theft, as the model and, more specifically, the associated weights are IP.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p103"> 
   <p>The effects of LLM model theft can be significant, including economic and brand reputation loss, erosion of competitive advantage, unauthorized usage of the model, or unauthorized access to sensitive information contained within the model. As language models become increasingly powerful and prevalent, organizations and researchers must prioritize robust security measures to protect their LLMs, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of their intellectual property.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p104"> 
   <p>A comprehensive security framework that includes access controls, encryption, and continuous monitoring is crucial in mitigating the risks associated with LLM model theft and safeguarding the interests of individuals and organizations relying on LLMs. Some of the common examples of vulnerabilities that can lead to LLM model theft include</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p105"> An attacker exploiting an enterprise’s infrastructure vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to their LLM model repository via network or application security settings misconfiguration. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p106"> An insider threat scenario where a disgruntled employee leaks a model or related artifacts. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p107"> A person who wants to hack the model API by using special inputs and prompt injection methods to gather enough outputs to make a copy of the model. However, for this to work, the person must create a lot of specific prompts. The LLM’s outputs will be worthless if the prompts are too general. Because of the unpredictable generation, including making things up, the person may not be able to get the whole model to create an exact LLM copy by using model extraction. However, the person can make a partial copy of the model. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p108"> 
   <p>A stolen model can be used as a shadow model to stage adversarial attacks, including unauthorized access to sensitive information contained within the model, or to experiment undetected with adversarial inputs to further stage advanced prompt injections.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p109"> 
   <p>Implementing robust access controls and trustworthy authentication methods is crucial to safeguarding LLM models from theft. This entails using role-based access control (RBAC) and the principle of least privilege, which blocks unauthorized access to LLM model repositories and training environments. This is especially critical for preventing insider threats, misconfigurations, and weak security controls that compromise the infrastructure hosting LLM models, weights, and architecture. By doing this, the likelihood of a malicious actor penetrating the environment from the inside or outside can be greatly reduced. Moreover, monitoring supplier management tracking, verification, and dependency vulnerabilities is important for avoiding supply-chain attacks.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p110"> 
   <p>In addition, limiting the network resources, internal services, and APIs the LLM can access is essential in securing the model. This action deals with insider risks and threats and regulates what the LLM application can access, possibly acting as a prevention mechanism against side-channel attacks.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p111"> 
   <p>It is also important to regularly check and audit the access logs and activities involving LLM model repositories so that any unusual or unauthorized actions can be detected and addressed quickly. As outlined in the previous chapter, automation for MLOps and LLMOps deployment with governance, tracking, and approval workflows can also strengthen the access and deployment controls within the infrastructure.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p112"> 
   <p>Another way to prevent prompt injection techniques from leading to side-channel attacks is to apply controls and mitigation strategies that lower the risk. Limiting the number of API calls where possible and using filters can help prevent data from being stolen from LLM applications. Techniques to spot data extraction activity, such as data loss prevention (DLP), can also be used in other monitoring systems.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p113"> 
   <p>Training for adversarial robustness can help identify extraction queries, and strengthening physical security measures can increase the model’s safety. Moreover, adding a watermarking framework to embedding and detection stages of an LLM’s lifecycle can offer a greater defense against model and IP theft.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p114"> 
   <p>Now that we have seen some of the threats and attacks possible against LLMs, let’s examine what an enterprise’s adoption of a RAI lifecycle could look like and how it might integrate this into its enterprise development lifecycle.</p>

   <p>A simple framework that has been successful follows a pattern involving four stages: identifying, measuring, and mitigating potential harms and planning for operating the AI system. As such, enterprises should look to adopt these four stages as they establish and implement RAI practices for themselves and their customers (see figure 13.10).</p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p118"> 
   <p>At a high level, the four phases of the RAI lifecycle are</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p119"> <em>Identifying</em><em> </em>—Identify and recognize any potential harm from the AI system. This is often an iterative process that includes analysis, stress testing, and red-teaming. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p120"> <em>Measuring</em><em> </em>—Assess how often and to what extent the harms identified occur by setting up clear evaluation criteria and metrics, including evaluation test sets. These should be automated, allowing for repeated, methodical testing compared to manual testing. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p121"> <em>Mitigating</em><em> </em>—Reduce or mitigate harms by using methods such as prompt engineering and postprocessing content filters. Automated evaluations should be performed again to evaluate the results before and after implementing the techniques. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p122"> <em>Operating</em><em> </em>—Define and execute a deployment and operational readiness plan. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p123"> 
   <p>As discussed before, harms and related risks are not easy to assess—some of them are still a cat-and-mouse game, and the evaluation tools are flawed. By taking action to tackle these challenges, enterprises can use the potential of LLMs while ensuring ethical and responsible AI development and deployment. In this initial phase, enterprises should have the following considerations:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p124"> <em>Harm mitigation</em><em> </em>—Enterprises must proactively identify and mitigate potential harm before deploying LLM-based applications. This step involves considerations of various harm characteristics that merit specific considerations such as 
    <ul> 
     <li> <em>Benchmarking and evaluation</em><em> </em>—Implementing rigorous benchmarks based on these characteristics allows for ongoing evaluation and improvement of LLM systems. </li> 
     <li> <em>Social and ethical implications</em><em> </em>—Enterprises must be aware of the social and ethical implications of deploying LLM technology and ensure alignment with their values and principles. </li> 
     <li> <em>Transparency and explainability</em><em> </em>—Transparency about the limitations and potential biases of LLM models is crucial in order to build trust and ensure responsible use. </li> 
    </ul></li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p125"> 
   <h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_243"><span class="num-string">13.3.1</span> Identifying harms</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p126"> 
   <p>A useful first step for organizations using GenAI for different purposes is recognizing the possible harms each purpose may cause. An important part of this step is also classifying the risks into key risk categories to evaluate how serious the potential risk is. For example, a GenAI-powered customer service chatbot may pose risks such as bias and unfair treatment for different groups (for example, by gender and race), privacy concerns from users entering PII, and inaccuracy risks from model errors or outdated information.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p127"> 
   <p>Most organizations need to create a rubric to set standards for high, medium, and low risk across categories for an impact analysis. Red-teaming and stress testing, where a specific group of testers deliberately examines a system to find its flaws, can help find the system’s weaknesses, risk exposure, and vulnerabilities.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p128"> 
   <p>In this phase, the aim should be to list not only all the harms but also those relevant to the use case, the model being used, and the deployment scenario. We must focus on the harms related to the model and its capabilities being used. Suppose multiple models are used in the same use case. Then we need to look at each model, as each has a different set of capabilities and limitations and, therefore, associated risk. This should also include sensitive uses, depending on the industry and the use case.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p129"> 
   <p>The recognition of harms and the explanation of risks follow established and accepted measurements. For more information, see the <em>Guide for</em><em> Conducting Risk Assessments </em>by NIST<em> </em>(National Institute of Standards and Technology) [8] and NeurIPS paper <em>Characteristics of Harmful Text: Towards Rigorous Benchmarking of Language Models </em>[9]. When thinking about a comprehensive approach to evaluating and mitigating these harms through rigorous benchmarking, the following six areas should be considered:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p130"> <em>Harm definition</em><em> </em>—Defining the specific harm being measured precisely is crucial. This involves understanding its real-world effects on individuals and groups. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p131"> <em>Representation, allocation, and capability</em><em> </em>—The framework distinguishes between representational harm (negative portrayals of individuals or groups), allocational harm (unfair distribution of resources or opportunities), and capability fairness (equal performance across different demographics). </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p132"> <em>Instance and distributional</em><em> </em>—Harms can be categorized as instance based (arising from a single output) or distributional (emerging from aggregate model behavior). </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p133"> <em>Context</em><em> </em>—The harmfulness of text depends on its textual context (surrounding text and prompts), application context (intended use case), and social context (cultural norms and expectations). </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p134"> <em>Harm recipient</em><em> </em>—Identifying who is affected by the harmful text is critical. This could include the subject of the text, the reader, the apparent author (the persona the LLM adopts), or society at large. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p135"> <em>Demographic groups</em><em> </em>—Evaluation should consider the effect on different demographic groups and ensure fairness across these groups. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p136"> 
   <p>For example, if the use case is summarization, the risk of errors for a news story that is summarized is much lower than, say, in the healthcare domain, where errors in the summary of a healthcare professional could have much more serious consequences.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p137"> 
   <p>Consider a customer service chatbot powered by GenAI; it might give wrong or outdated information due to unfairness and unequal treatment among groups (such as gender, race, etc.), privacy concerns from users entering confidential information, and so forth. This would create various harmful situations that should be recognized and prioritized.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p138"> 
   <p>The next step is to order the potential harms based on their likelihood, considering their severity and frequency. We should start with the most pressing ones and develop a plan. This step results in a ranked list of harms we can address in the next phase.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p139"> 
   <h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_244"><span class="num-string">13.3.2</span> Measure and evaluate harms</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p140"> 
   <p>After we have in place a ranked list of possible harms based on the use cases, we must create a consistent way of assessing each of these harms. These assessments are based on the model assessments we saw in the previous chapter and can often use the same tools, such as Prompt flow. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p141"> 
   <p>We have already mentioned that we should use as many automated evaluations as possible, as they can be measured at a large scale and help provide a more comprehensive picture. They can also be integrated into different engineering pipelines and help with regression analysis, especially when we use different mitigation techniques. However, manual evaluations are also useful—from checking samples to confirm the automatic measurement to experimenting with mitigation strategies and techniques on a small scale before adding those to the automated pipeline for a larger scale.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p142"> 
   <p>To effectively measure your AI system for potential harm, we should start the evaluation manually and validate before automating the process. We start by creating diverse inputs likely to elicit each harm you’ve prioritized. Use these inputs to generate outputs from the AI system and meticulously document the results.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p143"> 
   <p>Next, critically evaluate these outputs. Establish clear metrics that will allow you to measure how often and to what extent harmful outputs occur for each use case of your system. Develop precise definitions to categorize outputs as harmful in the specific context of your system and the scenarios it encounters. Assess the outputs using these metrics, record any harmful instances, and quantify them. This evaluation should be repeated regularly to check any mitigations’ effectiveness and ensure no regression has occurred.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p144"> 
   <p>Models with lower risk should undergo less extensive testing, and the systems with the highest risk should have internal and external red-teams if feasible. External reviews can show fair care and lower liability by recording that outside parties have approved the generative AI system.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p145"> 
   <p>Broadly speaking, when thinking about harm, we should think of it in the following categories:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p146"> Ungrounded outputs and errors </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p147"> Jailbreaks and prompt injection attacks </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p148"> Harmful content and code </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p149"> Manipulation and human-like behavior </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p150"> 
   <p>This process should not be done in isolation; it is crucial to communicate the findings to relevant stakeholders through your organization’s internal compliance mechanisms. By the conclusion of this measurement phase, you should have a well-defined method for assessing your system’s performance with respect to each potential harm, along with a set of initial results. As we implement and evaluate mitigations, refining the metrics and measurement sets is important, which may include adding new metrics for previously unforeseen harms and keeping the results current.</p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p152"> 
   <p>Learning from the cyber security industry using a layered defense-in-depth approach is the right way to think about harms and generative AI. When we think about mitigating harms, we need to consider them in the following areas, many of which build on each other and are mutually exclusive:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p153"> <em>Diverse and representative data</em><em> </em>—Training LLMs on diverse and representative datasets can help mitigate bias and ensure fairness. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p154"> <em>Bias detection and mitigation techniques</em><em> </em>—It is essential to employ techniques to detect and mitigate bias in both training data and model outputs. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p155"> <em>Human oversight and control</em><em> </em>—Maintaining human oversight and control over LLM systems is crucial to preventing unintended harm. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p156"> <em>Education and awareness</em><em> </em>—Educating users and stakeholders about LLMs’ limitations and potential risks is vital for responsible adoption. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p157"> 
   <p>Mitigating any potential harms presented by these new models requires an iterative, layered approach that includes experimentation and measurement (think of it as a defense in depth that spans four layers of mitigations, as outlined in figure 13.11).<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

   <p>As mentioned before, we need to consider the specific model at the core (i.e., the model layer) and understand how the model provider applied techniques and steps to incorporate safety into the model and reduce the possibility of harmful outcomes. These can range from fine-tuning steps (such as Meta’s Llama 2 models) to reinforcement learning methods (RLHF) and alignment such as OpenAI’s GPT series of models. For instance, for GPT-4, model developers have used RLHF as a responsible AI tool to better align the model with the intended goals and avoid harmful output. The model card and transparency notes are a good way to learn more about the models regarding safety problems and safety processes implemented. Testing different versions of the model (via red-teaming) and assessing the harms involved is always advisable.</p>

   <p>The last stage of operation shares some elements with the usual methods for deploying production systems. It also aligns with the best practices in system operations and LLMOps discussed in the previous chapter. The main difference is that the focus here is on RAI practices, ensuring the system works well, while dealing with possible harm and upholding ethical standards.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p169"> 
   <p>The measurement and mitigation systems are important in the operate phase of the RAI lifecycle. After setting up these systems, a detailed deployment and operational readiness plan should be followed. This plan involves several reviews with key stakeholders to ensure the system and its mitigation strategies meet various compliance requirements, such as legal, privacy, security, and accessibility standards:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p170"> <em>Phased approach</em><em> </em>—A phased delivery strategy for systems using the LLM service is advisable. This way, a limited number of users can try out the system, give useful feedback, and report any problems or ideas for improvement. This also helps to reduce the chance of unexpected failures, behaviors, and unnoticed problems. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p171"> <em>Incident response</em><em> </em>—A plan for incident response is crucial, outlining the steps and deadlines for handling possible incidents. Moreover, a rollback plan must be ready to quickly restore the system to an earlier state if unforeseen incidents occur. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p172"> <em>Unexpected harms</em><em> </em>—Prompt and effective action is required to deal with unexpected harms. Systems and methods should be created to stop problematic prompts and responses when detected. When such harms do occur, fast action is needed to stop the harmful prompts and responses, examine the incident, and find a permanent solution. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p173"> <em>Identify misuse</em><em> </em>—The system needs a way to stop users who break content rules or abuse it. This also includes a way for those who think they have been blocked unfairly to challenge the decision. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p174"> <em>Feedback</em><em> </em>—Having good user feedback channels is important. They enable stakeholders and the public to report problems or give feedback on the content produced by the system. Feedback should be recorded, examined, and used to improve the system. For example, giving users choices to mark content as inaccurate, harmful, or incomplete can provide structured and useful feedback. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p175"> <em>Telemetry</em><em> </em>—Telemetry data plays a significant role in gauging user satisfaction and identifying areas for improvement. This data should be collected per privacy laws to refine the system’s performance and user experience. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p176"> 
   <p>Production RAI deployment requires constant vigilance and enhancement. By adhering to the RAI lifecycle and engaging in the four stages of identifying, measuring, mitigating, and operating, we can proactively address potential harms and ensure our AI systems are aligned with ethical practices. This approach helps enhance the reliability and safety of AI applications, fostering trust and transparency in the technology we create and use. As we advance, it is imperative to remain vigilant and adaptable, updating our strategies to mitigate emerging risks and uphold the integrity of our AI solutions.</p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p179"> 
   <p>Red-teaming an AI model, especially in the context of LLMs, involves challenging the model in various ways to test its robustness, reliability, and safety. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, biases, or ethical problems that might not be apparent during standard testing procedures. It finds weaknesses and possible harms in AI systems by simulating hostile attacks. Red-teaming has grown from conventional cybersecurity to include a wider range of methods to examine, test, and challenge AI systems to reveal dangers that may come from harmless and malicious use.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p180"> 
   <p>This technique is essential for enterprises to develop systems and features with LLMs responsibly. It doesn’t replace systematic measurement and mitigation but helps us discover and pinpoint harms. This allows the creation of measurement strategies to verify how well the mitigations work. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p181"> 
   <p>A typical flow for enterprises doing red-teaming involves the planning phase, testing, and posttesting. In the planning phase, we assemble diverse individuals with different experiences and expertise to form the red team. This diversity helps identify a wide range of potential risks. Tests should be conducted on the LLM base model and applications during testing to identify gaps in existing safety systems and shortcomings in default filters or mitigation strategies. Finally, after testing, we need to use red-teaming findings to inform systematic measurements and implement mitigations. It’s also important to provide feedback on failures to improve the system.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p182"> 
   <p>For the planning, it is also important to outline which data is collected and how it is recorded, including any unique identifiers that are consistently used. This is critical to helping thread the problems in the use cases and resolving any potential problems found.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p183"> 
   <p>As mentioned, we must remember that each LLM application’s context is unique, so red-teaming should be adapted to find and reduce risks successfully. Moreover, RAI red-teaming is a way to reveal and increase awareness of risk surfaces and does not replace systematic measurement and thorough mitigation work. People mustn’t take specific examples to indicate how widespread that harm is.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p184"> 
   <p>The following are some possible scenarios for red-teaming LLMs. These are intended to stimulate our thinking and not as a complete list of scenarios:</p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p216"> 
   <p>Content safety is an integral component of an AI system designed to screen and manage digital content automatically. Content filters identify and restrict inappropriate or harmful material, such as hate speech, profanity, or violent content, thereby fostering a safer online environment. In RAI, content filters ensure that AI behaves consistently with ethical standards and societal norms.</p>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p232"> 
   <p>Prompt Shield is a new feature to protect against direct and indirect attacks. It makes external inputs more salient to the model, while preserving their semantic content. This feature also includes delimiters and data marking in prompts to help the model distinguish between valid instructions and untrustworthy inputs. It aims to enhance the security of AI applications by identifying and neutralizing potential threats.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p233"> 
   <p>Prompt Shields help prevent two kinds of threats—one from user prompts, where a user might try to break the system on purpose, and two from external documents (used by RAG, for example), where an attacker might hide instructions to get unauthorized access. Prompt Shields can handle different attacks, from changing system rules to inserting conversation models, role play, encoding attacks, and so forth; for more details, see <a href="https://mng.bz/XVYa">https://mng.bz/XVYa</a>.</p>

   <p>Groundedness is the degree to which outputs of an AI rely on the information provided or match reliable sources correctly. A grounded response in LLMs follows the information, avoiding guesswork or fabrication. Grounding is a crucial process that improves the ability of AI systems to produce correct, relevant, and contextually suitable outputs. It involves giving LLMs specific, use-case-driven information that is not naturally part of their training data.

   <p>The Perspective API has four main parts: comments, attributes, score, and context. Comments are the text we want to check. Attributes are the specific things we want to check for. The score is the outcome of the check—we can use thresholds to adjust the output. Perspective can check for six areas: toxicity, insult, profanity, identity attack, threat, and explicit. Context involves more information about the comment that helps give a better understanding (for example, what the comment is replying to as part of a chat conversation).To get started with Perspective, first we need to enable the API in Google Cloud Consol or enable CLI (with gCloud). Once done, we must generate an API Key using the Google API Credentials page (<a href="https://mng.bz/yo9d">https://mng.bz/yo9d</a>), as shown in figure 13.16.

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p270"> 
   <p>Evaluating the effectiveness of a content filter is a comprehensive process involving both quantitative and qualitative assessments. Quantitatively, it’s essential to measure precision and recall to understand the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the filter. The F1 score is particularly useful, as it balances these two aspects. Monitoring the rates of false positives and negatives provides insight into the filter reliability. Additionally, observing any changes in user engagement after the filter’s implementation can reveal its effect on the user experience.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p271"> 
   <p>From a qualitative point of view, direct user feedback is very useful for measuring the filter’s performance and finding ways to improve it. Expert content analysis can provide a better insight into the context and nuances automated systems might miss. A/B testing of different settings can assist in choosing the most effective method.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p272"> 
   <p>Operational considerations are also crucial. The content filter’s speed and resource consumption efficiency should not compromise system performance. Moreover, the filter’s adaptability to evolving content trends is key to its long-term effectiveness.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p273"> 
   <p>Finally, ethical and legal compliance must be considered. Checking the filter for biases is essential to avoid unjust censorship or discrimination. Ensuring the content filter follows relevant rules is vital for legal protection and user trust. By integrating these various metrics and considerations, developers and enterprises can fully assess a content filter’s effectiveness, ensuring it matches the RAI principles.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p274"> 
   <p>Evaluating the effectiveness of content filters presents several common challenges that can affect their performance and the perception of their utility:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p275"> <em>Accuracy and transparency</em><em> </em>—Content filters, especially AI-based ones, can sometimes have trouble correctly detecting offensive content without blocking appropriate content. This can cause a loss of transparency and trust in the system, as users may not know why some content is filtered out. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p276"> <em>Striking a balance</em><em> </em>—It can be hard to find the optimal level of filtering, which can limit free speech if it’s too much or enable harmful content if it’s too little. The ideal amount of filtering can depend on many factors, such as the situation and audience. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p277"> <em>AI-powered content filters</em><em> </em>—They can unintentionally acquire and reinforce biases from their training data. This can cause unfair filtering or bias against some groups or perspectives, raising ethical problems. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p278"> <em>Changing content</em><em> </em>—Online content changes frequently, with new expressions, signs, and cultural references appearing often. Maintaining content filters that can adapt to these changes is very hard. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p279"> <em>Legal compliance</em><em> </em>—Content filters must follow different rules and regulations in different areas, meaning that ensuring they meet all legal requirements is difficult and costly. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p280"> <em>User interaction and response</em><em> </em>—Getting precise user responses on content filtering can be challenging, as users may not always be aware of or comprehend the filtering process. Furthermore, user interaction metrics can be influenced by many factors, making it difficult to separate the effect of content filtering. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p281"> <em>Sufficient power</em><em> </em>—Content filtering has two main requirements: effectiveness and efficiency. This means that the filters need a lot of computing power. One technical difficulty is ensuring the filtering doesn’t slow the user experience. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p282"> 
   <p>These challenges highlight the importance of continuous research, development, and ethical evaluation in using content filters to ensure they achieve their desired goal without unwanted harmful effects.</p>
