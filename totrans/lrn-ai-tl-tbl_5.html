<h1><span class="label">Chapter 5. </span>Use Cases with Tableau Pulse</h1>

<p>In the previous chapters, you’ve seen all the building blocks it takes to construct metrics in Tableau Pulse. Now it is time to see what metrics in action look like for different industries. In this chapter, I share use cases for sales, finance, healthcare, and administering Tableau Pulse itself. My goal is that you’ll walk away from this chapter inspired by how you can implement Tableau Pulse into your analytics environment and how your end users can benefit from Pulse. In addition to giving you some inspiration, I’ll walk you through how to maximize and customize the insights section of Pulse metrics.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Use Case: Sales" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch05_use_case_sales_1732595608896954">
<h1>Use Case: Sales</h1>

<p>Sales <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="use cases" data-tertiary="sales" data-type="indexterm" id="kab059"/>data<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sales use case" data-type="indexterm" id="kab060"/> is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases, Tableau Pulse" data-type="indexterm" id="kab061"/>one of the most popular types of data sets you’re likely to work with. Rare is the company that doesn’t have some type of product that they are offering up to customers. So in this first use case, I want to show you how to re-create an existing Tableau dashboard focused on a pipeline of sales opportunities for a software company using Pulse. This exercise can be helpful if you’re tasked with transitioning existing content or if you need to make a decision whether to start with Pulse or to construct an entire dashboard. It will also help illustrate the type of insights that are automatically generated versus what your end users may have to determine on their own.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_1_1732595608887528">Figure 5-1</a> shows a dashboard where an end user can view several <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="KPIs (key performance indicators)" data-type="indexterm" id="kab072"/>key performance indicators (KPIs), and using the dropdown in the upper-right corner, can toggle between three time periods: MONTH TO DATE, QUARTER TO DATE, and YEAR TO DATE. Additionally, the user can click either of the two bottom charts to interactively filter by the opportunity type, the stage the opportunity is in, and the territory managing the opportunity.</p>

</div></figure>

<p>The layout of <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="software sales pipeline dashboard" data-type="indexterm" id="id565"/>the dashboard in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_1_1732595608887528">Figure 5-1</a> is very popular in the BI world. It includes high-level KPIs and the ability to change time periods for end of month/quarter/year reporting. Additionally, it has some detail on the bottom half, quickly displaying the distribution of the opportunities by important categories. The inclusion of comparison to prior time periods provides the context end users crave to determine whether they’re on target to meet their goals.</p>

<p>Now, let’s begin unpacking and re-creating this dashboard in Pulse. First, I’ll address one of the KPIs: how it is made in Tableau Desktop and how it can be made in Pulse. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_2_1732595608887561">Figure 5-2</a> shows the worksheet for the KPI, with the key areas driving the visualization highlighted.</p>

<p>Three key sections are driving this visualization:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Marks card</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Highlighted on the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Marks card" data-type="indexterm" id="id566"/>Marks card, three calculations have been constructed to generate the pipeline value for the time period chosen. These dynamic calculations change based on user selection.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt class="less_space pagebreak-before">TIME PERIOD (bottom of figure)</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Below the Marks card, this has a drop-down selection set to MONTH TO DATE. This is the controller that allows users to select time periods.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Filters shelf (top of figure)</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Above the Marks card, this shows the three filters in place. There are two <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Action filters" data-type="indexterm" id="id567"/>Action filters, which filter the worksheet based on Sales Territory and Opportunity Stage/Opportunity Type. These correspond to the two charts at the bottom of <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_1_1732595608887528">Figure 5-1</a>. There is also a simple <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="exclude filter" data-type="indexterm" id="id568"/>exclude filter (Won Flag: False) to remove any lost opportunities, as those don’t contribute to the pipeline.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 5-2. </span>Worksheet for a KPI</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>The parameter and calculations are the secret sauce that make this KPI work, but for someone newer to the Tableau world, they aren’t exactly easy or intuitive to make. Even for a seasoned professional, they are very calculation-intensive, requiring three calculations for each KPI being visualized (and several more that those calculations are dependent on).</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Here’s what’s actually going on within the calculations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Six Boolean calculations isolate different time periods, both the <em>current</em> time period and the <em>prior</em> time period. They rely on today’s date to determine whether an opportunity is within either of the time periods and will be used to filter data in subsequent calculations.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>There are two case statement calculations, one for each of the time periods, to determine which Boolean should be used for the filtering calculations.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>There are four calculations, one for each of the time period values, a percentage difference, and a difference (delta) between the current and prior period values.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_3_1732595608887585">Figure 5-3</a> shows all the calculations constructed for the KPI.</p>

</div></figure>

<p>Now that you’ve seen what’s required to create that seemingly simple KPI in Tableau Desktop, I’m going to re-create it as a Pulse metric. By now you’re an expert at creating metrics in Pulse, so it should be no surprise that this is an easy task. The steps are straightforward; I define the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The Measure used is Amount with an Aggregation of Sum.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The “Definition filters” dropdown is set to exclude false values for the Won Flag.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The “Time dimension” is Created Date.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Only “Prior period” is selected for Time Comparison; the Secondary comparison is set to None.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In Options, to allow for the same filtering experience as the interactive filtering, three fields are added as “Adjustable metric filters”: Sales Territory, Opportunity Type, and Opportunity Stage.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>“Number format” is set to Currency &gt; USD.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For the Insights type in Dimensions, “Value going up is” is set to Favorable, and Record-Level Outliers are turned off.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_4_1732595608887605">Figure 5-4</a> shows all the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="metric definitions, in Pulse" data-secondary="in sales case study" data-type="indexterm" id="id569"/>metric definition configurations in place, which truthfully took longer to screenshot than to select in the dropdowns.</p>

<p>Right away you <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="KPIs (key performance indicators)" data-startref="kab072" data-type="indexterm" id="id570"/>should be seeing the benefit that Pulse brings to visualizations involving comparison time periods. Instead of constructing calculations for each unique time period to be compared, it’s done automatically, and there are many more valuable time comparisons the dashboard didn’t feature. Similarly, the necessity to construct the percentage difference and value difference is no longer required, and instead these are automatically constructed.</p>

<p>Now to get down to the actual metric and spend some time assessing the automatically generated and summarized insights. This will help you understand the type of information those consuming Pulse metrics will be exposed to. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_5_1732595608887625">Figure 5-5</a> shows the metric created based on the configurations previously specified.</p>

<p>On the metric card, there’s a summary listing the top contributors by Opportunity Type, which was one of the selected adjustable metric filters. It is a valuable sound bite, and the inclusion of the percentages along with the actual values adds context to understand the distribution. Within the breakdown, you can toggle between the three categories to quickly compare the distribution of opportunities.</p>

</div></figure>

<p>Additionally, 12 pregenerated questions are in the Discover Top Insights section, each with its own companion bar chart and summarized statement. Here are the 12 <span class="keep-together">questions</span>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Which Sales Territory increased the most?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Which Sales Territory decreased the most?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Which Sales Territory had low Pipeline Generated?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Which Sales Territory had high Pipeline Generated?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Which Opportunity Type increased the most?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Which Opportunity Type decreased the most?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Which Opportunity Type had high Pipeline Generated?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Which Opportunity Stage had high Pipeline Generated?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Which Opportunity Stage had very high Pipeline Generated?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Which Opportunity Stage had low Pipeline Generated?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Which Opportunity Stage increased the most?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Which Opportunity Stage decreased the most?</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Of the questions generated, those aimed at the high and low pipeline generated are immediately visible both in the breakdown section of the metric and the dashboard the metric was based on. However, the remaining questions and their answers are harder to surface within the dashboard and do present interesting information. As an example, <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_6_1732595608887643">Figure 5-6</a> shows the chart and insight for the first question, aimed at demonstrating which Sales Territory increased its pipeline the most over the time period, a task that would take multiple clicks within the dashboard to uncover the same information. Serving it up automatically with a summary sentence and companion chart fully demonstrates the time savings that users may gain through Pulse.</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch05_figure_6_1732595608887643"><img alt="A screenshot of a survey  Description automatically generated" src="assets/lait_0506.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 5-6. </span>A top insight generated by Pulse</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Along the same lines, you’ll notice that none of the insights generated feature a combination or mixture of the fields (Sales Territory, Opportunity Type, Opportunity Stage) available for filtering or selection within the breakdown. So, potential insights like “Which Opportunity Stage are most New Business opportunities in?” that relates the intersection of Opportunity Stage and Opportunity Type aren’t immediately visible in Pulse, unlike the heat map on the dashboard. To get to this level of insight, an additional child metric from the existing metric definition, with the Opportunity Type set to New Business, will be necessary, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_7_1732595608887662">Figure 5-7</a>.</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch05_figure_7_1732595608887662"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer screen  Description automatically generated" src="assets/lait_0507.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 5-7. </span>A child metric with Opportunity Type filtered (see a larger version of this figure <a href="https://oreil.ly/lait0507"> online</a>)</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Knowing the types and depth of insights generated can help guide you as to whether Pulse is a good fit for your audience. It also provides direction on how many child metrics may need to be constructed to answer more pointed questions.</p>

<p>Finally, <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_8_1732595608887682">Figure 5-8</a> shows the Pulse start page for someone who has followed the five metrics featured in the dashboard, fully demonstrating what the Pulse experience would be like.

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Use Case: Finance" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch05_use_case_finance_1732595608897039">
<h1>Use Case: Finance</h1>

<p>With <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases, Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="finance" data-type="indexterm" id="kab062"/>Tableau <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="use cases" data-tertiary="finance" data-type="indexterm" id="kab063"/>Pulse, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="finance use case, Tableau Pulse" data-type="indexterm" id="kab064"/>the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="credit card transactions use study" data-type="indexterm" id="kab073"/>speed at which insights can be constructed offers a significant advantage over building complex calculations within a dashboard. The rapidity with which Pulse can enable data exploration can be a game changer, especially when the types of automated insights are customized. In this use case, I’m going to show you how a simple data set of credit card transactions can quickly add value and also enable anomaly detection in real time.</p>

<p>To add some context to this use case, imagine this project is for a small regional credit union that offers a high level of customer service. The credit union appeals to affluent customers who are also busy professionals. As part of the digital transformation the organization is undergoing, the product manager for mobile payments wants to understand customer habits and keep an eye out for any risky behaviors.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_9_1732595608887700">Figure 5-9</a> shows a snippet of the transaction data set. Currently the product manager has access to a reporting system where she can export transaction information, but she doesn’t have any real-time analytics or method to track the information she’s interested in. Let’s explore how Tableau Pulse can support her need for information.</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch05_figure_9_1732595608887700"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="assets/lait_0509.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 5-9. </span>A subset of credit card transactions</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>First, it’s worth mentioning that this data set and the task at hand are an optimal candidate for Tableau Pulse. The data itself is clean and well structured, and the requests to understand customer behavior and assess risks in real time lend themselves to the up-to-date insights that Pulse generates.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_10_1732595608887719">Figure 5-10</a> shows the various Pulse metrics constructed to help out the product manager. I’m going to unpack them at a high level and then focus on one specific metric and how it’s been customized to tackle her request to identify any risky <span class="keep-together">behaviors</span>.</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch05_figure_10_1732595608887719"><img alt="A screenshot of a graph  Description automatically generated" src="assets/lait_0510.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 5-10. </span>Pulse metrics based on credit card transactions (see a larger version of this figure <a href="https://oreil.ly/lait0510"> online</a>)</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>The metrics the product manager now has access to consist of a combination of analytical scopes. The top row contains operational metrics, providing insight into overall trends and behaviors at the credit union. The bottom row includes more specific metrics related to her needs for understanding risk and mobile payment behavior. This mix of metrics provides a great launching-off point, giving her the ability to understand the organization’s overall customer behaviors alongside her focus area. There’s immediate value gained with the ability to compare the Average Transaction Value for customers against those that are specific to Apple Pay and Google Pay. <span class="keep-together">Similarly,</span> she can use the Mobile Payment Ratio to understand whether her team’s efforts are increasing usage of mobile payment methods.</p>

<p>Beyond the quick insights she’s gained, you can see something interesting happening in the Average Transaction Value metric that’s filtered to include only Apple Pay transactions. Shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_11_1732595608887739">Figure 5-11</a>, there appear to be three unusual transactions of this payment type. Let’s unpack the details of this metric to see not only what it has found, but how the metric has been tuned to find the unusual <span class="keep-together">transactions</span>.</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch05_figure_11_1732595608887739"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="assets/lait_0511.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 5-11. </span>The full-size version of Average Transaction Value for Apple Pay (see a larger version of this figure <a href="https://oreil.ly/lait0511"> online</a>)</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>The top section of the metric is similar to what you’ve already seen, showing the time-bound trend and comparison you’ve come to know with Pulse. But the bottom section, where <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Discover Top Insights" data-type="indexterm" id="id574"/>Discover Top Insights is located, reveals something new: outlier transactions that are well outside of the statistically normal values for Apple Pay transactions within the credit union for the month.</p>

<p>Traditionally, a significant amount of code and algorithm creation is necessary to achieve this type of anomaly or outlier detection within a data set, but Pulse makes it easy. Besides eliminating the need to define what an anomaly is, you can also customize the settings of the metric to ensure this is the only type of insight the product manager will be served up.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_12_1732595608887758">Figure 5-12</a> shows how the insights have been customized, relying heavily on the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Record-Level Outliers feature" data-type="indexterm" id="id575"/> Record-Level Outliers feature. This includes defining a “Record identifier” and “Record identifier name,” and filling in Singular and Plural nouns to describe the records. Additionally, because they’re not relevant for the task at hand, all insights in the Contributions and Breakdowns section have been turned off.</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch05_figure_12_1732595608887758"><img alt="Screens screenshot of a computer screen  Description automatically generated" src="assets/lait_0512.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 5-12. </span>Insights configuration for Average Transaction Value</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>This level of tuning allows the outlier detection feature to shine and prominently displays the insights within the generated metric summaries. As you saw in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_10_1732595608887719">Figure 5-10</a>, the actual transactional data is displayed in a small data table, allowing immediate access to all the key information necessary to understand the anomalies. And although it is very unlikely that this anomaly detection will replace fraud detection applications used at the credit union, at least the product manager has real-time information available that can quickly shine a spotlight on anything atypical.</p>

<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>
<p>Pulse allows you to specify the unique record identifier and an identifier name. Both pieces of information will show up in the outlier data table within the Discover Top Insights section. You can take advantage of this by constructing a concatenated field in your published data source, like Transaction Detail, containing all relevant <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="credit card transactions use study" data-startref="kab073" data-type="indexterm" id="id576"/>information <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="finance use case, Tableau Pulse" data-startref="kab064" data-type="indexterm" id="id577"/>for <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="use cases" data-startref="kab063" data-tertiary="finance" data-type="indexterm" id="id578"/>the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases, Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="finance" data-startref="kab062" data-type="indexterm" id="id579"/>outliers.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Use Case: Healthcare" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch05_use_case_healthcare_1732595608897100">
<h1>Use Case: Healthcare</h1>

<p>Up to <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases, Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="healthcare" data-type="indexterm" id="kab065"/>now, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="use cases" data-tertiary="healthcare" data-type="indexterm" id="kab067"/>you’ve <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="healthcare use case" data-type="indexterm" id="kab069"/>seen how Tableau Pulse generates insights and can guide users on metrics they already follow. However, in this use case, you’ll see how creating new metrics after an initial insight from Pulse can provide even more valuable tracking and alerting. You’ll also see another example of how configuring specific insights for your audience helps support their needs.</p>

<p>This use case is for a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pharmacy case study" data-type="indexterm" id="kab074"/>pharmacy procurement manager at a large long-term care facility network. Since the organization is managing ongoing care for patients, monitoring fluctuating drug costs and supply is critical, especially with recent supply chain disruptions driving drug price instability. In the past, these costs have been reviewed on an annual basis, in alignment with supplier contract renewals, but the pharmacy procurement manager is looking for a more proactive way to assess risk, with the hope that the organization can have more negotiating power and alternative supplier options during contract renewal season.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_13_1732595608887777">Figure 5-13</a> shows a snippet of the data set, which includes the purchase history of various medications. Additional key fields are included, like the therapeutic category and usage information for the drug, the supplier name, and whether the supplier is a preferred vendor. These key fields will be included as adjustable filters in the metrics.</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch05_figure_13_1732595608887777"><img alt="A table with many different types of products  Description automatically generated with medium confidence" src="assets/lait_0513.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 5-13. </span>A subset of drug-purchasing history</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>To help identify price fluctuation risks or changes from available suppliers, the manager already follows three metrics, shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_14_1732595608887796">Figure 5-14</a>: Total Cost, Units Ordered, and Unit Cost. These will serve as the launching point for further investigation.</p>

</div></figure>

<p>Focusing on the Units Ordered metric, its insights have been limited to those that can help identify the largest areas of risk and spot a situation where a supplier may have too much influence over the price of drugs ordered. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_15_1732595608887814">Figure 5-15</a> shows the customizations. The Total Cost and Unit Cost metrics have been configured similarly, with one additional insight turned on: Current Trend.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 5-15. </span>The insight configurations for Units Ordered</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>With the insights specifically configured, it becomes clear where the manager should focus her immediate efforts: on cardiovascular drugs, a therapeutic category mentioned in each of the three metric summaries. To see if this is really an issue, she can use the adjustable filters to set each metric to include only cardiovascular medications. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_16_1732595608887833">Figure 5-16</a> shows what surfaces after she limits the Units Ordered metric, unearthing that the company is ordering more cardiovascular drugs from nonpreferred suppliers. Furthermore, 54.1% of these medications are procured from just three suppliers, representing a potential supplier concentration risk in their supply chain.</p>

<p>Armed with this new information about the suppliers, she can now build even more pointed metrics to see how Unit Cost has been affected by this finding. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_17_1732595608887852">Figure 5-17</a> shows the metrics she’s created, allowing her to track the unit cost of cardiovascular drugs for both preferred and nonpreferred suppliers separately.</p>

<p>Finally, she can dig into the details for each metric and see whether this increase in cost is uniform across all suppliers, representing an unavoidable shift in the market, or it’s a supplier-related issue that can be mitigated. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_figure_18_1732595608887871">Figure 5-18</a> shows the breakdown for each metric.</p>

<p>With just a few clicks, she’s drilled down and found actionable insights. The rising cost in cardiovascular drugs appears to be limited to a handful of suppliers, both preferred and nonpreferred. Knowing this, she can not only track the pricing fluctuations for these specific suppliers, but also feed this information back to the company’s medication buyers to immediately change their purchasing strategies. She has also followed all these metrics, ensuring they’re closely tracked <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pharmacy case study" data-startref="kab074" data-type="indexterm" id="id580"/>until <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="healthcare use case" data-startref="kab069" data-type="indexterm" id="id581"/>the issue <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="use cases" data-startref="kab067" data-tertiary="healthcare" data-type="indexterm" id="id582"/>is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases, Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="healthcare" data-startref="kab065" data-type="indexterm" id="id583"/>resolved.</p>

<p>I recommend turning off the Record-Level Outliers, Top Detractors, and Bottom Contributors insights, as they don’t add much value to understanding how Pulse is growing within your Tableau environment.</p>

	<p>For richer analytics on Pulse utilization, you can combine other data sources available in Admin Insights by using Prep Builder. For
		example, you can join the Site Content data source with the TS
		Users data source to include the user’s site role and license type.
		Similarly, you can include the Groups a user is a member of by

<p>Similar to the metrics created from Site Content, I recommend turning off the Record-Level Outliers, Top Detractors, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="use cases" data-startref="kab068" data-tertiary="Pulse utilization" data-type="indexterm" id="id585"/>and Bottom <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases, Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="Pulse utilization" data-startref="kab066" data-type="indexterm" id="id586"/>Contributors insights.</p>

<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>
<p>Since the time dimension used from Subscriptions is a creation date, you’ll be seeing point-in-time activity and not actual values. As an example, the Total Follows metric described in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_table_2_1732595608890802">Table 5-2</a> provides the total follows within the metric time period, but not the total follows active in the environment.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>You’ve now seen four distinct use cases for Tableau Pulse. In the sales example, you saw how an existing dashboard can be reimagined as Pulse metrics. As the example was explored, you saw how Pulse metrics provide a very direct insights experience compared to the self-service and exploration afforded in the dashboard. In both the finance and healthcare examples, you saw how fine-tuning the types of insights <span class="keep-together">generated</span> can be used for anomaly detection and concentrated risk detection, <span class="keep-together">respectively</span>. Additionally, within the healthcare example, you journeyed along with the pharmaceutical procurement manager through the creation of new metrics, ultimately leading to actionable intelligence for buyers. Finally, you saw a variety of metrics that can be created from Admin Insights that can immediately help you understand both user adoption and activity as your organization uses Pulse.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06_integrating_and_extending_tableau_pulse_1732595609344755">Chapter 6</a> shifts gears and explores Pulse from the angle of a developer. You’ll learn how to integrate Pulse with Slack, embed Pulse metrics within Salesforce or a custom web application, and understand key details about the APIs available to support your development work.</p>
