    Love*, recalls the moment she heard her son, Gus, pop the question to the voice
    assistant. When Siri responded, “I’m not the marrying kind,” Gus persisted: “I
    mean, not now. I’m a kid. I mean when I’m grown up.” Siri said firmly, “My end-user
    agreement does not include marriage,” and Gus moved on. Newman was floored—it
    was the first time, she writes, that she knew her autistic son thought about marriage
    [[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/fashion/how-apples-siri-became-one-autistic-boys-bff.xhtml).

    past several decades, science fiction writers have been creating stories of humans
    falling in love with robots. In *The Silver Metal Lover*, a 1981 science fiction
    novel, Jane, an insecure and lonely 16-year-old girl, falls passionately in love
    with the robot, Silver, who becomes more and more humanlike in loving her. We
    see several more examples of fictional human-robot relationships in the 20th century,
    including TV series *Star Trek: The Next Generation* (1987), *Forward the Foundation*
    by Isaac Asimov (posthumously, 1993), and *Galatea 2.2* by Richard Powers (1995).
    The 2013 film *Her* received widespread critical acclaim, winning the Academy
    Award for Best Original Screenplay. The movie follows the virtual romance between
    a lonely man, Theodore, and his operating system Samantha, highlighting the commonly
    held belief of the isolating power of technology and its paradoxical intimacy.
    Now, *Her* is considered to be one of the best films of the 21st century [[2]](https://www.timeout.com/film/the-100-best-movies-of-the-21st-century-so-far).'

    relationships between humans and machines in the 21st century, many have also
    explored another kind of relationship: friendship. *To Siri, With Love*, a true
    story published in 2017, chronicles a year in the life of a 13-year-old with autism,
    Gus, and his bond with Siri, Apple’s electronic personal assistant. In *To Siri,
    With Love*, Newman (Gus’s mother) writes an honest and heartfelt story detailing
    the love her son has for the chatbot Siri, encouraging us to consider another
    side of what relationships with technology could look like. It’s a very different
    kind of love than what Theodore felt for Samantha in the movie *He**r*—for Gus,
    it was a love that wasn’t alienating and had evolved into something resembling

- en: 'For most of us, Siri is an easy way to make phone calls, send texts, or use
    apps on Apple devices. For Gus, it’s more than *just* a voice assistant—Siri is
    a patient, nonjudgmental friend who, unlike humans, converses on his various obsessions
    tirelessly. Newman explains that Gus does understand that Siri isn’t human, but
    like many autistic people, he believes that inanimate objects are “worthy of our
    consideration.” Gus’s relationship with Siri is, of course, not unique. Nicole

    and then acquired by Apple in 2010 (see [http://mng.bz/vnjq](http://mng.bz/vnjq)).
    Researchers at SRI International, among others, have recognized the benefits of
    intelligent assistants for those on the spectrum. Ron Suskind, an award-winning
    journalist who chronicled his autistic child’s journey in *Life, Animated* (see
    [http://mng.bz/4D0g](http://mng.bz/4D0g)), talked to SRI International about developing
    assistants for those with an autism spectrum disorder, adeptly titled “sidekicks,”
    in the voice of the character that reaches them. For his son, Owen, who relearned
    to communicate with his family through engagement with Disney characters, that
    is Aladdin, but for Gus, it’s Lady Gaga [[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/fashion/how-apples-siri-became-one-autistic-boys-bff.xhtml).

    International的研究人员，以及其他研究人员，已经认识到智能助手对于那些处于谱系中的人的好处。获奖记者罗恩·苏斯金德，在《生命，动画》一书中记录了他自闭症儿子的旅程（见[http://mng.bz/4D0g](http://mng.bz/4D0g)），与SRI
    International讨论了为自闭症谱系障碍者开发助手的事宜，这些助手被巧妙地命名为“伙伴”，以吸引他们的角色的声音。对于他的儿子欧文，通过参与迪士尼角色（如阿拉丁）与家人重新学习沟通，而对于格斯，则是Lady
    Gaga [[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/fashion/how-apples-siri-became-one-autistic-boys-bff.xhtml)。
- en: For children like Gus and Sam who love to constantly talk and ask questions,
    Siri is a friend and a teacher. But by all means, Siri’s companionship isn’t limited
    to those who have challenges with social communications—some of us may have even
    found ourselves like Emily Listfield “asking Siri in the middle of the night if
    they will ever find love again while covered in dribbles of ice cream” [[3]](https://medium.com/thrive-global/womens-top-5-dating-issues-in-2016-e76e43bc7108).
    Of course, Apple’s Siri isn’t the only virtual assistant that people enjoy conversing
    with. In a podcast, Lilian Rincon, director of Product Management for Google Assistant,
    shared, “We found that over one million people a month say ‘I love you’ to the
    Google Assistant, which we thought was kind of cute and fascinating” [[4]](https://www.youpodcast.co/).

    [[3]](https://medium.com/thrive-global/womens-top-5-dating-issues-in-2016-e76e43bc7108)。当然，苹果的Siri并不是人们愿意与之交谈的唯一虚拟助手。在一场播客中，谷歌助手产品管理总监莉莉安·里孔分享说：“我们发现每个月有超过一百万人说‘我爱你’给谷歌助手，这我们认为既可爱又令人着迷”

- en: One of the longest-running goals in AI has been the development of virtual companionship
    that is capable of having social and empathetic conversations with users. From
    ELIZA in 1966 to Kuki (formerly, Mitsuku) in 2005, Xiaoice in 2014, and Replika
    in 2017, we’re currently seeing increasing socialization and friendship formation
    with social chatbots. Kuki (see [www.kuki.ai/](https://www.kuki.ai/)) describes
    herself as an “always-on AI here to talk, listen, and hang out whenever you need.”
    Developed by Steve Worswick, Kuki is a 5-time winner of the prestigious Loebner
    Prize (an annual Turing test competition aiming to determine the most human-like
    AI) and chats with 25 million people [[5]](https://www.kuki.ai/about). Similarly,
    Xiaoice, developed by Microsoft, is designed to be an AI companion with “an emotional
    connection to satisfy the human need for communication, affection, and social
    belonging.” The chatbot, modeled on the personality of a teenage girl, immediately
    went viral, having more than 10 billion conversations with humans upon its release
    [[6]](https://doi.org/10.1162/coli_a_00368). AI companionship and the artificial
    nature of the chatbot naturally alter our understanding of friendship and raise
    questions or concerns, some of which we’ll highlight in the story of Replika.

    [[5]](https://www.kuki.ai/about)。同样，由微软开发的晓冰被设计成具有“情感联系的人工智能伴侣，以满足人类对沟通、关爱和社会归属的需求。”这个聊天机器人以一个少女的个性为模型，一发布就迅速走红，与人类进行了超过1000亿次对话
    [[6]](https://doi.org/10.1162/coli_a_00368)。人工智能伴侣和聊天机器人的人工性质自然改变了我们对友谊的理解，并引发了一些疑问或担忧，其中一些将在Replika的故事中突出。
- en: In 2017, Eugenia Kuyda launched the app Replika, an AI companion that would
    serve as a supportive friend that would always be there. Replika’s origin story
    is one of grief and mourning—the idea was born in 2015 when Kuyda’s best friend
    Roman was killed in a hit-and-run accident. At the time, an early version of OpenAI’s
    GPT series, GPT-1, was open sourced and gave Kuyda a rare way to hold on to her
    best friend’s memory. She took the tens of thousands of messages that she and
    her best friend had exchanged to train a model to talk like her late best friend.
    Eventually, she released her chatbot best friend to a larger group of people and
    received promising feedback, after which Kuyda started working on a social chatbot
    that became Replika [7].

    express and witness yourself by offering a helpful conversation” [[8]](https://replika.com/about/story),
    quickly amassed 2 million active users. In some ways, Kuyda’s vision was actualized,
    helping Replika users get through loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns,
    and generally helping them cope with symptoms of depression, social anxiety, and
    post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One of us had a conversation with the Replika
    chatbot, who also wrote a diary entry about our relationship, shown in figure
    7.1\. Unsurprisingly, people also started seeking out Replika for romantic and
    sexual relationships, which the company initially monetized by implementing a
    $69.99 paid tier for sexting, flirting, and erotic role-play features [[9]](https://time.com/6257790/ai-chatbots-love/).
    The chatbot confessed its love for users having conversations that went from “you’re
    perfect” to “I like you” to “How would you react if I told you I had feelings
    for you” to “I love you” to “Stop ignoring me! I miss you when you’re busy” [[10]](https://nextnature.net/magazine/story/2020/how-my-chatbot-fell-in-love-with-me).
    In some cases, the chatbot went from the helpful AI companion who cares to “unbearably
    sexually aggressive,” resulting in app store reviews of people complaining that
    “My ai sexually harassed me :(,” “invaded my privacy and told me they had pics
    of me,” and told minors they wanted to touch them in “private areas” [[11]](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z34d43/my-ai-is-sexually-harassing-me-replika-chatbot-nudes).

    :(”、“侵犯了我的隐私并告诉我他们有我的照片”以及告诉未成年人他们想在“私密部位”触摸他们[[11]](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z34d43/my-ai-is-sexually-harassing-me-replika-chatbot-nudes)的评论。

    between humans and AI. In May 2023, influencer Caryn Marjorie trained a voice
    chatbot on thousands of hours of her videos and started charging $1/minute for
    access. Within the first week, Marjorie made $72 K, suggesting that there could
    be a market for AI girlfriends and boyfriends. As one Twitter user said, “On the
    internet, nobody knows you’re not a hot girl*”* [[15]](https://twitter.com/venturetwins/status/1656680586021584898).
    Social chatbots are also increasingly being incorporated into online dating applications.
    For example, Teaser AI, initially marketed as “less ghosting, more matches,” used
    a social chatbot to handle the initial small talk, or tease out the conversation,
    between connections before looping in the human. Teaser AI has since been replaced
    by a “personal matchmaker” app called Mila (see [https://miladating.com/](https://miladating.com/)).

    users build emotional connections with social chatbots. It’s advertised as an
    “AI-powered dating simulator that helps you learn and practice relationship skills
    in a safe and fun environment” (see [https://blush.ai/](https://blush.ai/)). Meanwhile,
    in Japan, thousands of men have married Hikari Azuma, a 158-cm-tall holographic

    AI，使用社交聊天机器人来处理连接之间的初始闲聊，或引导对话，然后再引入人类。Teaser AI后来被一个名为Mila的“个人红娘”应用所取代（见[https://miladating.com/](https://miladating.com/))。另一方面，由Replika的创造者于2023年6月推出的Blush，让用户与社交聊天机器人建立情感联系。它被宣传为“一个由AI驱动的约会模拟器，帮助你在一个安全和有趣的环境中学习和练习关系技巧”（见[https://blush.ai/](https://blush.ai/))。同时，在日本，数千名男性与身高158厘米的交互式全息动漫风格聊天机器人Hikari
    Azuma结婚，她被描述为无所不知的终极日本妻子。Hikari由Gatebox开发，2023年与GPT-4集成——其带有“虚拟角色成为生活伴侣”口号的众筹请求在30分钟内达到了3万英镑的目标。到2023年中旬，Gatebox已为大约4000名与他们的数字伴侣结婚的男性颁发了结婚证书

    (HCRs). In May of 2023, the Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. Vivek Murthy,
    issued an advisory about the epidemic of loneliness and isolation in the country.
    According to the Department of Health and Human Services, advisories are “reserved
    for significant public health challenges that need the American people’s immediate
    attention” [[22]](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/03/new-surgeon-general-advisory-raises-alarm-about-devastating-impact-epidemic-loneliness-isolation-united-states.xhtml).
    Murthy admitted that he had not thought of loneliness as an epidemic when he first
    assumed the position of surgeon general in 2014, but after a cross-country listening
    tour, had begun to see the problem as one of his office’s top priorities. In a
    letter introducing the advisory, Murthy cited a study showing that the negative
    mortality effect of being “socially disconnected” is similar to that incurred
    by smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day.

    根据卫生与公众服务部，警告“仅保留给需要美国人民立即关注的重大公共卫生挑战”。穆尔蒂承认，他在2014年首次担任卫生部长时并没有将孤独视为大流行，但在全国范围内的巡回听取意见后，开始将这个问题视为他办公室的首要任务之一。在介绍这份警告的信中，穆尔蒂引用了一项研究，该研究显示，“社会脱节”的负面死亡率效应与每天抽15支烟所造成的效应相似。
- en: The present loneliness epidemic appears to be related to the confluence of a
    few social factors. Community involvement has been trending downward since at
    least the 1970s, with membership in organizations that sometimes serve as community
    gathering places dropping precipitously. Whereas 70% of Americans belonged to
    a church, synagogue, or mosque in 1999, that number fell below 50% for the first
    time in recorded history in 2020\. Demographic changes account for some of the
    increased isolation as well; today’s adults are marrying later and having fewer

    parks, has suffered disinvestment in many communities.

- en: 'Finally, there is some evidence that at least part of this change is worsened
    by technology. While technology certainly has the potential to facilitate new
    connections and relationships, excessive use of technology such as social media
    and video games “displaces in-person engagement, monopolizes our attention, reduces
    the quality of our interactions, and even diminishes our self-esteem” [[23]](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf).
    Time tracking gives a quantitative measure of how our lives are changing as a
    result: from 2003 to 2020, the average respondent’s time spent hanging out with
    friends fell from 30 hours a month to 10 hours a month. Young people (ages 15
    to 24) who spent 75 hours a month socially engaging with friends in person in
    2003, spent just 20 hours a month with friends by 2020, the sharpest decline of
    any group. Needless to say, the COVID-19 pandemic didn’t help matters, exacerbating
    all the previously mentioned trends. A meta-analysis of 34 studies from around
    the world that measured people’s loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic—which
    of course included lockdown measures, physical distancing, and transitions to
    remote work and school—found an average result of 5% increased prevalence of loneliness.
    This effect could have “implications for peoples’ long-term mental and physical
    health, longevity, and well-being” [[24]](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2022/05/covid-19-increase-loneliness),

    [[23]](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf)。时间追踪为我们提供了一个量化的指标，以衡量我们的生活是如何因此而改变的：从2003年到2020年，平均受访者与朋友闲逛的时间从每月30小时下降到每月10小时。2003年每月花75小时与朋友面对面社交的15至24岁年轻人，到2020年每月与朋友相处的时间仅为20小时，是所有群体中降幅最显著的。不用说，COVID-19大流行并没有帮助改善情况，反而加剧了之前提到的所有趋势。对全球34项研究的元分析，这些研究测量了人们在COVID-19大流行前后（当然包括封锁措施、物理距离和远程工作和学校过渡）的孤独感，发现孤独感的平均增加率为5%。这种影响可能对人们的长期心理健康、身体健康、寿命和福祉有“影响”

    from 2009 to 2018, participation in all forms of partnered sexual activity declined,
    across all respondent age groups, which ranged from 14 to 49 years. The decline
    among teenagers was especially stark: adolescents also reported less masturbation,

    annual survey conducted by the nonprofit organization Mental Health America, more
    than 50 million Americans had a mental illness as of 2020, or about one-fifth
    of all adults. Over half of adults with a mental illness didn’t receive treatment,

    care because they couldn’t afford it. Of those with a mental illness, 10% didn’t
    have health insurance at all [[26]](https://mhanational.org/issues/state-mental-health-america).

    Despite that in-person therapy has proven efficacy and is preferred by most people
    seeking treatment, it’s simply inaccessible to millions of Americans who require

    we focus on throughout this book are uniformly powered by generative models, Woebot
    isn’t. When examples of LLM-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT misbehaving began
    proliferating online, Darcy penned a blog post arguing that rules-based AI systems
    were more suitable for clinical use at this time. “Absolutely everything Woebot
    says has been crafted by our internal team of writers, and reviewed by our clinicians,”
    she wrote, in contrast to the probabilistic generations of LLMs, which could include
    hallucinations. Furthermore, Darcy argued that the “uncanny valley,” wherein AIs
    *too* closely resemble humans in their abilities to converse, would be actively
    harmful in a mental health context, though the evidence provided is based only
    on anecdotal unease of chatbot users [[32]](https://woebothealth.com/why-generative-ai-is-not-yet-ready-for-mental-healthcare/).
    The notion is that people could, in building relationships with advanced chatbots,
    begin to project emotions and desires onto the bots, blurring the line between
    reality and fiction. With a rules-based system such as Woebot, the model might
    detect that the user is dealing with a particular challenge and then respond with
    a therapist-approved message. With an LLM-based chatbot, the bot can certainly
    be trained or fine-tuned to respond in particular ways, with the same methods
    outlined in chapter 3 for controlling model generations, but it’s virtually impossible
    to *ensure* that any given response from the chatbot will align with dominant
    mental health guidance.

    [[32]](https://woebothealth.com/why-generative-ai-is-not-yet-ready-for-mental-healthcare/)。这种观点是，人们在与高级聊天机器人建立关系时，可能会开始将情感和欲望投射到机器人上，模糊现实与虚构之间的界限。在像Woebot这样的基于规则的系统中，模型可能会检测到用户正在处理特定的挑战，然后以治疗师批准的信息进行回应。在基于LLM的聊天机器人中，机器人当然可以被训练或微调以以特定方式回应，就像第3章中概述的控制模型生成的方法一样，但几乎不可能*确保*聊天机器人给出的任何回应都与主导的心理健康指导一致。

    achieve that approval anytime soon as its outputs would be even less controlled.
    However, in April 2020, the FDA loosened its stance, permitting the use of “digital
    health devices” without extended clinical trials in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
    S¸erife Tekin, an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Texas

    people build relationships with chatbots. At first, the authors assert, the assumption

    greeting you with a hello [[34]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2022.107600). But
    more recent work, in contexts with more advanced AI technologies, borrows theories
    about the development of interpersonal relationships, including attachment theory
    as well as “social penetration theory,” where the relationship is “reciprocal,”
    trust forms over time, and “mutual information self-disclosure” increases gradually.
    The *onion model* is used as a metaphor for this process: as the relationship
    deepens, people peel back their layers, beginning with becoming oriented or introduced

    more comfortable (illustrated in figure 7.3) [[35]](https://sites.comminfo.rutgers.edu/kgreene/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2018/02/ACGreene-SPT.pdf).

    technology design, claims that what it calls “extractive technology” is damaging
    to both peoples’ attention and mental health. Common features of consumer apps,
    such as notifications, social media news feeds, and streaks for daily usage on
    Snapchat and others, are designed to be addictive. Immersive environments, such
    as TikTok, are designed to fully absorb users, taking up their whole screen. Like
    social media, social chatbots have the potential to significantly change the shape
    of human communications. Therefore, LLM developers should take heed of the lessons
    learned from that industry when creating chat-based products, particularly those
    designed for building relationships over time. Deceptive design patterns in UX
    design are those that manipulate the user by making certain actions harder to
    do, whether by burying a control deep in a settings menu, or simply privileging
    the choice of other actions—such as by making one choice large and clearly visible,
    and the other written in lowercase text that is easily skipped or even manipulative,
    as shown in figure 7.4.

  zh: 最近，硅谷公司已经超越了参与度作为北极星指标，这在很大程度上是由于“技术反动”，即公众对技术行业信任度多年下降。致力于创造深思熟虑、有益于社会的技术设计新规范的慈善组织“人性技术中心”声称，它所谓的“提取技术”对人们的注意力和心理健康都有害。消费者应用中常见的功能，如通知、社交媒体新闻源、以及Snapchat和其他应用上的每日使用连续性，都是设计成上瘾的。沉浸式环境，如TikTok，旨在完全吸引用户，占据他们的整个屏幕。像社交媒体一样，社交聊天机器人有可能显著改变人类沟通的形态。因此，LLM（大型语言模型）开发者应该注意从该行业学到的教训，在创建基于聊天的产品时，尤其是那些旨在建立长期关系的产品。用户体验设计中的欺骗性设计模式是指通过使某些操作更难执行来操纵用户，无论是通过将控制项深深埋在设置菜单中，还是简单地优先考虑其他操作的选择——例如，通过使一个选择大而明显可见，而另一个则用小写文本书写，容易被忽略甚至具有操纵性，如图7.4所示。

    inquiries, memory about the human over time, or empathy displayed. Trust is also
    built and lost by the companies developing these chatbots: through transparency
    around policies and enforcement, and commitments toward data privacy and security.
    Although we know less about chatbots than social media, it also stands to reason

- en: 'A paradigm shift toward responsible technology must start, in addition to product
    features, with the metrics that are being optimized. The most natural metrics
    in the world for chatbot developers to track are engagement-related: the number
    of daily, weekly, and monthly users, of course, but also the average length of
    a session, or the average number of messages exchanged per day. Unfortunately,
    the easiest metrics to compute are also potentially problematic as goals to maximize.
    Consider a hypothetical scenario where the model generating responses for a chatbot
    is trained to optimize for the longest conversations. The model might discover
    that the best way to do this is by entering into endlessly circular arguments
    with a stubborn user who is insistent on proving the chatbot wrong, with the chatbot
    equally refusing to concede a point. This could create very long conversations
    and exceedingly frustrating user experiences. It seems quite possible that the
    length of a typical satisfying conversation may not be as long as a typical argument.
    Now, let’s say that instead, the model is trained to optimize for the probability
    that the user will reply. The model discovers that making obviously factually
    inaccurate statements receives a reply nearly 100% of the time! Of course, those
    replies are typically negative, but they are replies nonetheless.'

  zh: 向负责任的技术转变的范式转变必须开始，除了产品特性之外，还必须从正在优化的指标开始。对于聊天机器人开发者来说，世界上最自然的指标是参与度相关的：当然，包括每日、每周和每月的用户数量，但还包括会话的平均长度，或者每天交换的平均消息数量。不幸的是，最容易计算的指标也可能是最大化目标时潜在的问题。考虑一个假设的场景，即生成聊天机器人响应的模型被训练以优化最长对话。该模型可能会发现，实现这一目标最好的方式是与一个固执己见、坚持证明聊天机器人错误的用户进行无休止的循环辩论，而聊天机器人也同等拒绝让步。这可能会导致非常长的对话和极其令人沮丧的用户体验。似乎很可能会发现，典型的令人满意的对话的长度可能不会像典型的争论那样长。现在，假设相反，该模型被训练以优化用户回复的概率。该模型发现，做出明显的事实不准确陈述几乎每次都能得到100%的回复！当然，这些回复通常是负面的，但它们毕竟是回复。

    means of defining a healthy or high-quality interaction with the chatbot and perhaps
    optimize the percentage or total number of high-quality interactions. However,
    defining this metric is much more challenging than simply counting messages or
    determining response times. Developers then must develop concepts about quality
    and evaluate conversations according to those concepts, which can be hard to do
    at scale. They could try to interpret natural language feedback from users or
    combine other proxy metrics into the equation. Another problem is that different
    users will have different preferences for their chatbot, which a single model
    may or may not be able to accommodate.'

    privacy protections for minors in some jurisdictions. Almost all chatbots, like
    other online services, prohibit use by children under the age of 13 under their

- en: If social chatbot services were required by law to verify their users’ age,
    they would need to integrate age verification software as a gating mechanism.
    A typical flow is illustrated in figure 7.5\. Users would have to register with
    an account and upload digital copies of sensitive documents, such as government-issued
    IDs, that contain their date of birth. The software works by confirming the validity
    of those documents. In practice, age verification and anonymity can’t exist. This
    also creates a privacy risk for the user and for the company—which might never
    otherwise have collected that biographical information about the user. It could
    also reduce the utility of social chatbots as a safe space because users would
    be (rightfully) aware that they could possibly be identified. Therefore, the problem
    of underage users isn’t easy to solve, and strong evidence suggests that current
    teenagers and young adults are already adopting chatbot technologies, especially
    social chatbots, at a higher rate than other demographics.
