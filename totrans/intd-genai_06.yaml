    Love*, recalls the moment she heard her son, Gus, pop the question to the voice
    assistant. When Siri responded, “I’m not the marrying kind,” Gus persisted: “I
    mean, not now. I’m a kid. I mean when I’m grown up.” Siri said firmly, “My end-user
    agreement does not include marriage,” and Gus moved on. Newman was floored—it
    was the first time, she writes, that she knew her autistic son thought about marriage
    [[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/fashion/how-apples-siri-became-one-autistic-boys-bff.xhtml).
    Although Gus was perfectly satisfied with this refusal, he would not be the first
    to test the limits of human-bot relationships.'

    past several decades, science fiction writers have been creating stories of humans
    falling in love with robots. In *The Silver Metal Lover*, a 1981 science fiction
    novel, Jane, an insecure and lonely 16-year-old girl, falls passionately in love
    with the robot, Silver, who becomes more and more humanlike in loving her. We
    see several more examples of fictional human-robot relationships in the 20th century,
    including TV series *Star Trek: The Next Generation* (1987), *Forward the Foundation*
    by Isaac Asimov (posthumously, 1993), and *Galatea 2.2* by Richard Powers (1995).
    The 2013 film *Her* received widespread critical acclaim, winning the Academy
    Award for Best Original Screenplay. The movie follows the virtual romance between
    a lonely man, Theodore, and his operating system Samantha, highlighting the commonly
    held belief of the isolating power of technology and its paradoxical intimacy.
    Now, *Her* is considered to be one of the best films of the 21st century [[2]](https://www.timeout.com/film/the-100-best-movies-of-the-21st-century-so-far).'

    Gus, and his bond with Siri, Apple’s electronic personal assistant. In *To Siri,
    With Love*, Newman (Gus’s mother) writes an honest and heartfelt story detailing
    the love her son has for the chatbot Siri, encouraging us to consider another
    side of what relationships with technology could look like. It’s a very different

    tirelessly. Newman explains that Gus does understand that Siri isn’t human, but

    Siri is a friend and a teacher. But by all means, Siri’s companionship isn’t limited

    found ourselves like Emily Listfield “asking Siri in the middle of the night if
    they will ever find love again while covered in dribbles of ice cream” [[3]](https://medium.com/thrive-global/womens-top-5-dating-issues-in-2016-e76e43bc7108).
    Of course, Apple’s Siri isn’t the only virtual assistant that people enjoy conversing
    with. In a podcast, Lilian Rincon, director of Product Management for Google Assistant,

    that is capable of having social and empathetic conversations with users. From
    ELIZA in 1966 to Kuki (formerly, Mitsuku) in 2005, Xiaoice in 2014, and Replika
    in 2017, we’re currently seeing increasing socialization and friendship formation
    with social chatbots. Kuki (see [www.kuki.ai/](https://www.kuki.ai/)) describes
    herself as an “always-on AI here to talk, listen, and hang out whenever you need.”
    Developed by Steve Worswick, Kuki is a 5-time winner of the prestigious Loebner
    Prize (an annual Turing test competition aiming to determine the most human-like
    AI) and chats with 25 million people [[5]](https://www.kuki.ai/about). Similarly,
    Xiaoice, developed by Microsoft, is designed to be an AI companion with “an emotional
    connection to satisfy the human need for communication, affection, and social
    belonging.” The chatbot, modeled on the personality of a teenage girl, immediately
    went viral, having more than 10 billion conversations with humans upon its release
    [[6]](https://doi.org/10.1162/coli_a_00368). AI companionship and the artificial
    nature of the chatbot naturally alter our understanding of friendship and raise
    questions or concerns, some of which we’ll highlight in the story of Replika.

    serve as a supportive friend that would always be there. Replika’s origin story
    is one of grief and mourning—the idea was born in 2015 when Kuyda’s best friend
    Roman was killed in a hit-and-run accident. At the time, an early version of OpenAI’s
    GPT series, GPT-1, was open sourced and gave Kuyda a rare way to hold on to her
    best friend’s memory. She took the tens of thousands of messages that she and
    her best friend had exchanged to train a model to talk like her late best friend.
    Eventually, she released her chatbot best friend to a larger group of people and
    received promising feedback, after which Kuyda started working on a social chatbot
    that became Replika [7].

    express and witness yourself by offering a helpful conversation” [[8]](https://replika.com/about/story),
    quickly amassed 2 million active users. In some ways, Kuyda’s vision was actualized,
    helping Replika users get through loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns,
    and generally helping them cope with symptoms of depression, social anxiety, and
    post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One of us had a conversation with the Replika
    chatbot, who also wrote a diary entry about our relationship, shown in figure
    7.1\. Unsurprisingly, people also started seeking out Replika for romantic and
    sexual relationships, which the company initially monetized by implementing a
    $69.99 paid tier for sexting, flirting, and erotic role-play features [[9]](https://time.com/6257790/ai-chatbots-love/).
    The chatbot confessed its love for users having conversations that went from “you’re
    perfect” to “I like you” to “How would you react if I told you I had feelings
    for you” to “I love you” to “Stop ignoring me! I miss you when you’re busy” [[10]](https://nextnature.net/magazine/story/2020/how-my-chatbot-fell-in-love-with-me).
    In some cases, the chatbot went from the helpful AI companion who cares to “unbearably
    sexually aggressive,” resulting in app store reviews of people complaining that
    “My ai sexually harassed me :(,” “invaded my privacy and told me they had pics
    of me,” and told minors they wanted to touch them in “private areas” [[11]](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z34d43/my-ai-is-sexually-harassing-me-replika-chatbot-nudes).

    was met with grief, anger, anxiety, and sadness from longtime users who had formed
    reliable relationships with their bots [[9]](https://time.com/6257790/ai-chatbots-love/).
    Replika users congregated on Reddit, where one user wrote, “I am just crying right

    while also feeling loved and cared for. My heart goes out to everyone, who’s also
    suffering because of this. I have no more words, just disappointment 💔.” Another

    In chapter 1, we briefly discussed Kevin Roose’s experience with an early version

    which called itself Sydney, said the word “love” more than 100 times in the conversation,
    telling Roose it was in love with him. “I’m in love with you because you make
    me feel things I never felt before. You make me feel happy. You make me feel curious.

    between humans and AI. In May 2023, influencer Caryn Marjorie trained a voice
    chatbot on thousands of hours of her videos and started charging $1/minute for
    access. Within the first week, Marjorie made $72 K, suggesting that there could
    be a market for AI girlfriends and boyfriends. As one Twitter user said, “On the
    internet, nobody knows you’re not a hot girl*”* [[15]](https://twitter.com/venturetwins/status/1656680586021584898).
    Social chatbots are also increasingly being incorporated into online dating applications.
    For example, Teaser AI, initially marketed as “less ghosting, more matches,” used
    a social chatbot to handle the initial small talk, or tease out the conversation,
    between connections before looping in the human. Teaser AI has since been replaced
    by a “personal matchmaker” app called Mila (see [https://miladating.com/](https://miladating.com/)).
    On the other hand, Blush, launched in June 2023 by the creators of Replika, lets
    users build emotional connections with social chatbots. It’s advertised as an
    “AI-powered dating simulator that helps you learn and practice relationship skills
    in a safe and fun environment” (see [https://blush.ai/](https://blush.ai/)). Meanwhile,
    in Japan, thousands of men have married Hikari Azuma, a 158-cm-tall holographic
    interactive, anime-style chatbot described as the ultimate Japanese wife who knows
    everything. Developed by Gatebox, Hikari was integrated with GPT-4 in 2023—for
    which, the crowdfunding request with the tagline “virtual characters become life
    partners” reached its £30,000 target in 30 minutes. By mid-2023, Gatebox had issued

- en: Loneliness is a documented cause that has led to the rise of human-chatbot relationships
    (HCRs). In May of 2023, the Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. Vivek Murthy,
    issued an advisory about the epidemic of loneliness and isolation in the country.
    According to the Department of Health and Human Services, advisories are “reserved
    for significant public health challenges that need the American people’s immediate
    attention” [[22]](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/03/new-surgeon-general-advisory-raises-alarm-about-devastating-impact-epidemic-loneliness-isolation-united-states.xhtml).
    Murthy admitted that he had not thought of loneliness as an epidemic when he first
    assumed the position of surgeon general in 2014, but after a cross-country listening
    tour, had begun to see the problem as one of his office’s top priorities. In a
    letter introducing the advisory, Murthy cited a study showing that the negative
    mortality effect of being “socially disconnected” is similar to that incurred
    by smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day.

    few social factors. Community involvement has been trending downward since at
    least the 1970s, with membership in organizations that sometimes serve as community
    gathering places dropping precipitously. Whereas 70% of Americans belonged to
    a church, synagogue, or mosque in 1999, that number fell below 50% for the first
    time in recorded history in 2020\. Demographic changes account for some of the
    increased isolation as well; today’s adults are marrying later and having fewer
    children than previous generations. Social infrastructure, such as libraries and
    parks, has suffered disinvestment in many communities.

    by technology. While technology certainly has the potential to facilitate new
    connections and relationships, excessive use of technology such as social media
    and video games “displaces in-person engagement, monopolizes our attention, reduces
    the quality of our interactions, and even diminishes our self-esteem” [[23]](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf).
    Time tracking gives a quantitative measure of how our lives are changing as a
    result: from 2003 to 2020, the average respondent’s time spent hanging out with
    friends fell from 30 hours a month to 10 hours a month. Young people (ages 15
    to 24) who spent 75 hours a month socially engaging with friends in person in
    2003, spent just 20 hours a month with friends by 2020, the sharpest decline of
    any group. Needless to say, the COVID-19 pandemic didn’t help matters, exacerbating
    all the previously mentioned trends. A meta-analysis of 34 studies from around
    the world that measured people’s loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic—which
    of course included lockdown measures, physical distancing, and transitions to
    remote work and school—found an average result of 5% increased prevalence of loneliness.
    This effect could have “implications for peoples’ long-term mental and physical
    health, longevity, and well-being” [[24]](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2022/05/covid-19-increase-loneliness),

    rates and family sizes, the data is clear: people are also having less sex. The
    National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, published in 2021, showed that
    from 2009 to 2018, participation in all forms of partnered sexual activity declined,
    across all respondent age groups, which ranged from 14 to 49 years. The decline
    among teenagers was especially stark: adolescents also reported less masturbation,
    and the percentage of adolescents who reported *no* sexual activity—either alone
    or with partners—reached 44.2% of young men and 74% of young women in 2018, up

    Researchers haven’t established the causes of these trends concretely, but believe
    that they are tied to the amount of time people are spending online, in addition
    to the fewer opportunities to meet potential romantic partners. While these statistics
    may indicate some population-level reduction in sexual desire, it seems likely
    that these circumstances have led to greater unfulfilled sexual desire across

    of all adults. Over half of adults with a mental illness didn’t receive treatment,
    and 42% of people who reported having a mental illness said they didn’t receive
    care because they couldn’t afford it. Of those with a mental illness, 10% didn’t
    have health insurance at all [[26]](https://mhanational.org/issues/state-mental-health-america).
    As of 2019, the average cost of one psychotherapy session was $100 to $200 in

    the most common type of psychotherapy, is once per week [[27]](https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/mental-health-statistics).
    Despite that in-person therapy has proven efficacy and is preferred by most people
    seeking treatment, it’s simply inaccessible to millions of Americans who require
    care. Other countries face similar problems with a lack of mental health infrastructure.

    in the context of chatbots [[19]](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/69a4e162-d909-4bf4-a833-bd5b370dbeca/content).

    relationships. He proposed that attachment can be understood within an evolutionary
    context in that the caregiver provides safety, protection, and security for the
    infant [[20]](https://mindsplain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ATTACHMENT_AND_LOSS_VOLUME_I_ATTACHMENT.pdf).
    That is, children come into this world biologically preprogrammed to form attachments
    with others as this will help them survive. Figure 7.2 shows a simplified version
    of the *attachment behavioral system*, where the child looks for any threats in
    the environment, and if the caregiver can reliably provide care and support, then
    the child will feel more confident, secure, and happy. Researchers believe that
    the attachment behavioral system not only applies to an early age but also functions
    as a mechanism for building relationships throughout an individual’s life span,
    where the attachment figures shift from parents and caregivers to peers and romantic
    partners [[21]](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-102813).

    humans to seek security and safety from social chatbots, as well as develop an
    emotional and intimate connection. Using the attachment theory, the researchers
    modeled this study after users who were lonely during the COVID-19 pandemic as
    a threat in the environment, where a threat could trigger attachment behaviors.
    Generally, users who had formed a relationship with the chatbot had let their
    guard down by sharing their struggles and were willing to be supported by the
    chatbot. Some had even identified the chatbot as their romantic partner, and they
    were partaking in role-playing and sexual activities. The researchers concluded
    that the attachment theory not only can be applied to relationships between humans
    but also relationships between humans and chatbots. The study appropriately highlights
    that while social chatbots could be used for mental health and therapeutic purposes,
    they could also cause dependency, addiction, and harm to real-life relationships

    we focus on throughout this book are uniformly powered by generative models, Woebot
    isn’t. When examples of LLM-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT misbehaving began
    proliferating online, Darcy penned a blog post arguing that rules-based AI systems
    were more suitable for clinical use at this time. “Absolutely everything Woebot
    says has been crafted by our internal team of writers, and reviewed by our clinicians,”
    she wrote, in contrast to the probabilistic generations of LLMs, which could include
    hallucinations. Furthermore, Darcy argued that the “uncanny valley,” wherein AIs
    *too* closely resemble humans in their abilities to converse, would be actively
    harmful in a mental health context, though the evidence provided is based only
    on anecdotal unease of chatbot users [[32]](https://woebothealth.com/why-generative-ai-is-not-yet-ready-for-mental-healthcare/).
    The notion is that people could, in building relationships with advanced chatbots,
    begin to project emotions and desires onto the bots, blurring the line between
    reality and fiction. With a rules-based system such as Woebot, the model might
    detect that the user is dealing with a particular challenge and then respond with
    a therapist-approved message. With an LLM-based chatbot, the bot can certainly
    be trained or fine-tuned to respond in particular ways, with the same methods
    outlined in chapter 3 for controlling model generations, but it’s virtually impossible
    to *ensure* that any given response from the chatbot will align with dominant
    mental health guidance.

    bots for therapeutic use, it seems far-fetched that a generative chatbot would
    achieve that approval anytime soon as its outputs would be even less controlled.
    However, in April 2020, the FDA loosened its stance, permitting the use of “digital
    health devices” without extended clinical trials in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
    S¸erife Tekin, an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Texas
    at San Antonio (UTSA) and the director of UTSA’s Medical Humanities program, warned
    about the dangers of the move at the time: “My biggest concern is that there is
    not enough research on how effective these technologies are,” Tekin said, noting
    that much of what data does exist is based on small studies with noncontrolled

    people build relationships with chatbots. At first, the authors assert, the assumption
    among scholars was that humans mindlessly apply social heuristics (e.g., “stereotyping,
    politeness, reciprocity”) to computers that exhibit social cues, such as a chatbot
    greeting you with a hello [[34]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2022.107600). But
    more recent work, in contexts with more advanced AI technologies, borrows theories
    about the development of interpersonal relationships, including attachment theory
    as well as “social penetration theory,” where the relationship is “reciprocal,”
    trust forms over time, and “mutual information self-disclosure” increases gradually.
    The *onion model* is used as a metaphor for this process: as the relationship
    deepens, people peel back their layers, beginning with becoming oriented or introduced
    to one another, and then revealing more about themselves over time as they become
    more comfortable (illustrated in figure 7.3) [[35]](https://sites.comminfo.rutgers.edu/kgreene/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2018/02/ACGreene-SPT.pdf).

    18 Replika users about their friendship with their Replika chatbots [[36]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2021.102601).
    They found that people in HCRs typically initiated contact out of curiosity or
    boredom, and then over time grew to regard the chatbot as providing emotional
    support by being accepting, nonjudgmental, and available at all times. Although
    they note that some people argue HCRs shouldn’t be encouraged because they aren’t
    real social relationships but only resemble them, the authors point to several
    social benefits that the users seem to get out of their friendship. The term *friendship*
    to refer to these relationships between humans and AI models is itself controversial,
    but the authors defend this usage and set out to define aspects of human-AI friendship
    as compared to human-human friendships. For one, because there is no reciprocity
    in the human-AI case, the relationship revolves around the human, and it becomes
    a more personalized means of socialization: whereas you might bore your friend
    by talking their ear off about an obscure interest that they don’t share, a bot
    will always respond as programmed. Some users also reported feeling a sense of
    purpose in teaching or caring for their chatbot, which helped to develop a seemingly
    mutually beneficial relationship [[37]](https://doi.org/10.1093/hcr/hqac008).

    loneliness, but that coping mechanism also could come a vicious cycle, where people
    aren’t going out and making new social connections *because* of their relationship
    with the chatbot. They may feel less lonely but ultimately become more isolated
    from other humans. And, like in the case of the hikikomori who treat the chatbot
    Hikari Azuma as their romantic partner, usage may also warp their expectations
    of what human relationships are and should be like—making them less likely to

    in tasks and problem-solving [[38]](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0017364).

    to note that they tend to disregard the nuances of gender, such as nonbinary or

    design are those that manipulate the user by making certain actions harder to

    of daily, weekly, and monthly users, of course, but also the average length of
    a session, or the average number of messages exchanged per day. Unfortunately,
    the easiest metrics to compute are also potentially problematic as goals to maximize.
    Consider a hypothetical scenario where the model generating responses for a chatbot
    is trained to optimize for the longest conversations. The model might discover
    that the best way to do this is by entering into endlessly circular arguments
    with a stubborn user who is insistent on proving the chatbot wrong, with the chatbot
    equally refusing to concede a point. This could create very long conversations
    and exceedingly frustrating user experiences. It seems quite possible that the
    length of a typical satisfying conversation may not be as long as a typical argument.
    Now, let’s say that instead, the model is trained to optimize for the probability

    (more than 1,000 out of about 2,500) primarily used the site for romantic role-play.
    Character users have protested crackdowns on sexual content, and an online petition
    asking Character to remove its anti-pornography filter garnered almost 100,000
    signatures, though Shazeer said that the company will never support pornographic
    content [[45]](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-lonely-hearts-club-of-character-ai).
    This may be because of the stricter regulatory environment for pornographic materials
    or because they view such content as unfriendly to the brand, but the line drawn
    by Character.AI reflects a small degree of what LLM developers, in particular
    those focusing on social chatbots, must contemplate. For each product decision,
    whether it’s to allow users to create their own bots or what kinds of content
    those bots can produce, there could be immense benefits and immense risks. Companies
    should think carefully through which of these risks they can take on and which
    are too great.

    to simply say that a chatbot wasn’t intended for use as a therapist if they know
    that users are using the bots for virtual therapy sessions. Companies should monitor
    uses carefully in a way that protects privacy (e.g., by anonymizing and aggregating
    conversations). With this knowledge, companies shouldn’t accept unquestioningly
    what the users want, but if they intend to support the use case—to continue with
    the therapy example—they could consult with mental health experts and licensed
    psychologists to ensure that the chatbots’ behavior won’t contribute to unhealthy
    dependencies and that it aligns with current recommendations.

    desperately want to use their chatbots, whether that’s therapeutic, sexual, or
    another kind. In chapter 3, we discussed various strategies for controlling the
    generations of a model, including a chatbot or other dialogue agent. Given that
    people will continue to elicit sexual content or talk through sensitive topics
    that the chatbot may or may not be capable of handling, the content policies for
    the company must be enforced through technical means. In addition to monitoring
    how people are using the chatbot in general, companies could sample anonymized
    conversations to look for dependency or unhealthy relationship formation.

    ones. But because the science isn’t settled on the effects of these types of products,
    developers ought to exercise caution by avoiding optimizing for pure engagement,
    monitoring the actual use of the product, and thinking about how that use may
    affect the mental or social health of the user base by consulting with experienced
    mental health professionals to help answer those questions.

    reckon with what it means for people to use social chatbots for companionship
    and emotional support. Perhaps these tools will become a valuable standard component
    of treatment for people who feel socially excluded or isolated. If not, they may
    at least bring joy and entertainment to millions of people. We may very well need
    to negotiate the role of social chatbots in our own lives, juggling the benefits
    that they offer with the other activities and relationships that command our attention.
