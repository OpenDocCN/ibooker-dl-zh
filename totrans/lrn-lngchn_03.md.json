You’ve now built a basic RAG system to power an AI app for personal use.    However, a production-ready AI app used by multiple users requires a more advanced RAG system. In order to build a robust RAG system, we need to answer the following questions effectively:    *   How do we handle the variability in the quality of a user’s input?           *   How do we route queries to retrieve relevant data from a variety of data sources?           *   How do we transform natural language to the query language of the target data source?           *   How do we optimize our indexing process, i.e., embedding, text splitting?              Next we’ll discuss the latest research-backed strategies to answer these questions and build a production-ready RAG system.

By combining ranks from different queries, we pull the most relevant documents to the top of the final list. RRF is well-suited for combining results from queries that might have different scales or distributions of scores.    Let’s demonstrate RAG-Fusion in code. First, we craft a prompt similar to the multi-query retrieval strategy to generate a list of queries based on the user query:    *Python*    ```", "```py `Output (4 queries):\"\"\"``)`  `def` `parse_queries_output``(``message``):`     `return` `message``.``content``.``split``(``'``\\n``'``)`  `llm` `=` `ChatOpenAI``(``temperature``=``0``)`  `query_gen` `=` `prompt_rag_fusion` `|` `llm` `|` `parse_queries_output` ```", "```py   ```", "```py` ```", "```py *JavaScript*    ```", "```py    Once we’ve generated our queries, we fetch relevant documents for each query and pass them into a function to *rerank* (that is, *reorder* according to relevancy) the final list of relevant documents.    The function `reciprocal_rank_fusion` takes a list of the search results of each query, so a list of lists of documents, where each inner list of documents is sorted by their relevance to that query. The RRF algorithm then calculates a new score for each document based on its ranks (or positions) in the different lists and sorts them to create a final reranked list.    After calculating the fused scores, the function sorts the documents in descending order of these scores to get the final reranked list, which is then returned:    *Python*    ```", "```py    *JavaScript*    ```", "```py    Notice that the function also takes a `k` parameter, which determines how much influence documents in each query’s result sets have over the final list of documents.

Some examples of typical changes made are:    *   Removing irrelevant/unrelated text from the query.           *   Grounding the query with past conversation history. For instance, to make sense of a query such as *and what about in LA,* we need to combine it with a hypothetical past question about the weather in SF, to arrive at a useful query such as *weather in LA*.           *   Casting a wider net for relevant documents by also fetching documents for related queries.           *   Decomposing a complex question into multiple, simpler questions and then including results for all of them in the final prompt to generate an answer.              The right rewriting strategy to use will depend on your use case.    Now that we’ve covered the main query transformation strategies, let’s discuss the second major question to answer in order to build a robust RAG system: How do we route queries to retrieve relevant data from multiple data sources?```", "```py`` ```", "```py ```", "```py` ```", "```py`` ```", "```py```", "````` ```py`# Query Routing    Although using a single vector store is useful, the required data may live in a variety of data sources, including relational databases or other vector stores.    For example, you may have two vector stores: one for LangChain Python documentation and another for LangChain JS documentation. Given a user’s question, we would like to *route* the query to the appropriate inferred data source to retrieve relevant docs. *Query routing* is a strategy used to forward a user’s query to the relevant data source.    ## Logical Routing    In *logical routing*, we give the LLM knowledge of the various data sources at our disposal and then let the LLM reason which data source to apply based on the user’s query, as shown in [Figure 3-8](#ch03_figure_8_1736545666780744).  ![A diagram of a brain  Description automatically generated](assets/lelc_0308.png)  ###### Figure 3-8\\. Query routing to relevant data sources    In order to achieve this, we make use of function-calling models like GPT-3.5 Turbo to help classify each query into one of the available routes. A *function call* involves defining a schema that the model can use to generate arguments of a function based on the query. This enables us to generate structured outputs that can be used to run other functions. The following Python code defines the schema for our router based on three docs for different languages:    *Python*    ``` from typing import Literal  from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI  # Data model class RouteQuery(BaseModel):     \"\"\"Route a user query to the most relevant datasource.\"\"\"      datasource: Literal[\"python_docs\", \"js_docs\"] = Field(         ...,         description=\"\"\"Given a user question, choose which datasource would be   most relevant for answering their question\"\"\",     )  # LLM with function call  llm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature=0) structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(RouteQuery)  # Prompt  system = \"\"\"You are an expert at routing a user question to the appropriate data   source.  Based on the programming language the question is referring to, route it to the   relevant data source.\"\"\"  prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(     [         (\"system\", system),         (\"human\", \"{question}\"),     ] )  # Define router  router `=` prompt `|` structured_llm ```py    *JavaScript*    ``` import { ChatOpenAI } from \"@langchain/openai\"; import { z } from \"zod\";  const routeQuery = z.object({   datasource: z.enum([\"python_docs\", \"js_docs\"]).describe(`Given a user   question, choose which datasource would be most relevant for answering   their question`), }).describe(\"Route a user query to the most relevant datasource.\")  const llm = new ChatOpenAI({model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature: 0}) const structuredLlm = llm.withStructuredOutput(routeQuery, {name: \"RouteQuery\"})  const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([   ['system', `You are an expert at routing a user question to the appropriate   data source.  Based on the programming language the question is referring to, route it to   the relevant data source.`],   ['human', '{question}'] ])  const router = prompt.pipe(structuredLlm) ```py    Now we invoke the LLM to extract the data source based on the predefined schema:    *Python*    ``` question = \"\"\"Why doesn't the following code work:  from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate  prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\"human\", \"speak in {language}\"]) prompt.invoke(\"french\") \"\"\"  result = router.invoke({\"question\": question})  result.datasource # \"python_docs\" ```py    *JavaScript*    ``` const question = `Why doesn't the following code work:  from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate  prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\"human\", \"speak in {language}\"]) prompt.invoke(\"french\") `  await router.invoke({ question }) ```py    *The output:*    ``` {     datasource: \"python_docs\" } ```py    Notice how the LLM produced JSON output, conforming to the schema we defined earlier. This will be useful in many other tasks.    Once we’ve extracted the relevant data source, we can pass the value into another function to execute additional logic as required:    *Python*    ``` def choose_route(result):     if \"python_docs\" in result.datasource.lower():         ### Logic here          return \"chain for python_docs\"     else:         ### Logic here          return \"chain for js_docs\"  full_chain = router | RunnableLambda(choose_route) ```py    *JavaScript*    ``` function chooseRoute(result) {   if (result.datasource.toLowerCase().includes('python_docs')) {     return 'chain for python_docs';   } else {     return 'chain for js_docs';   } }   const fullChain = router.pipe(chooseRoute)  ```py    Notice how we don’t do an exact string comparison but instead first turn the generated output to lowercase, and then do a substring match. This makes our chain more resilient to the LLM going off script and producing output that doesn’t quite conform to the schema we asked for.    ###### Tip    Resilience to the random nature of LLM outputs is an important theme to keep in mind when building your LLM applications.    Logical routing is most suitable when you have a defined list of data sources from which relevant data can be retrieved and utilized by the LLM to generate an accurate output. These can range from vector stores to databases and even APIs.    ## Semantic Routing    Unlike logical routing, *semantic routing* involves embedding various prompts that represent various data sources alongside the user’s query and then performing vector similarity search to retrieve the most similar prompt. [Figure 3-9](#ch03_figure_9_1736545666780765) illustrates.  ![A diagram of a diagram of a notepad and a brain  Description automatically generated](assets/lelc_0309.png)  ###### Figure 3-9\\.

But most data available for use in production apps is structured and typically stored in relational databases. In addition, unstructured data embedded in a vector store also contains structured metadata that possesses important information.    *Query construction* is the process of transforming a natural language query into the query language of the database or data source you are interacting with. See [Figure 3-10](#ch03_figure_10_1736545666780785).  ![A diagram of data types  Description automatically generated](assets/lelc_0310.png)  ###### Figure 3-10\\. Illustration of query languages for various data sources    For example, consider the query: *What* *are movies about aliens in the year 1980?* This question contains an unstructured topic that can be retrieved via embeddings (*aliens*), but it also contains potential structured components (*year == 1980*).    The following sections dive deeper into the various forms of query construction.    ## Text-to-Metadata Filter    Most vector stores provide the ability to limit your vector search based on metadata. During the embedding process, we can attach metadata key-value pairs to vectors in an index and then later specify filter expressions when you query the index.    LangChain provides a `SelfQueryRetriever` that abstracts this logic and makes it easier to translate natural language queries into structured queries for various data sources. The self-querying utilizes an LLM to extract and execute the relevant metadata filters based on a user’s query and predefined metadata schema:    *Python*    ``` from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import AttributeInfo from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI  fields = [     AttributeInfo(         name=\"genre\",         description=\"The genre of the movie\",         type=\"string or list[string]\",     ),     AttributeInfo(         name=\"year\",         description=\"The year the movie was released\",         type=\"integer\",     ),     AttributeInfo(         name=\"director\",         description=\"The name of the movie director\",         type=\"string\",     ),     AttributeInfo(         name=\"rating\", description=\"A 1-10 rating for the movie\", type=\"float\"     ), ] description = \"Brief summary of a movie\"  llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)  retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(     llm, db, description, fields, )  print(retriever.invoke(     \"What's a highly rated (above 8.5) science fiction film?\")) ```py    *JavaScript*    ``` import { ChatOpenAI } from \"@langchain/openai\"; import { SelfQueryRetriever } from \"langchain/retrievers/self_query\"; import { FunctionalTranslator } from \"@langchain/core/structured_query\";  /**  * First, we define the attributes we want to be able to query on.  * in this case, we want to be able to query on the genre, year, director,   * rating, and length of the movie.  * We also provide a description of each attribute and the type of the attribute.  * This is used to generate the query prompts.  */ const fields = [   {     name: \"genre\",     description: \"The genre of the movie\",     type: \"string or array of strings\",   },   {     name: \"year\",     description: \"The year the movie was released\",     type: \"number\",   },   {     name: \"director\",     description: \"The director of the movie\",     type: \"string\",   },   {     name: \"rating\",     description: \"The rating of the movie (1-10)\",     type: \"number\",   },   {     name: \"length\",     description: \"The length of the movie in minutes\",     type: \"number\",   }, ]; const description = \"Brief summary of a movie\";  const llm = new ChatOpenAI(); const attributeInfos = fields.map((field) => new AttributeInfo(field.name,     field.description, field.type));    const selfQueryRetriever = SelfQueryRetriever.fromLLM({   llm,   db,   description,   attributeInfo: attributeInfos,   /**  * We need to use a translator that translates the queries into a  * filter format that the vector store can understand. LangChain provides one   * here.  */   structuredQueryTranslator: new FunctionalTranslator(), });  await selfQueryRetriever.invoke(   \"What's a highly rated (above 8.5) science fiction film?\" ); ```py    This results in a retriever that will take a user query, and split it into:    *   A filter to apply on the metadata of each document first           *   A query to use for semantic search on the documents              To do this, we have to describe which fields the metadata of our documents contain; that description will be included in the prompt. The retriever will then do the following:    1.  Send the query generation prompt to the LLM.           2.  Parse metadata filter and rewritten search query from the LLM output.           3.  Convert the metadata filter generated by the LLM to the format appropriate for our vector store.           4.  Issue a similarity search against the vector store, filtered to only match documents whose metadata passes the generated filter.              ## Text-to-SQL    SQL and relational databases are important sources of structured data, but they don’t interact directly with natural language. Although we can simply use the LLM to translate a user’s query to SQL queries, there is little margin for error.    Here are some useful strategies for effective text to SQL translations:    Database description      To ground SQL queries, an LLM must be provided with an accurate description of the database. One common text-to-SQL prompt employs an idea reported in this paper and others: provide the LLM with a `CREATE TABLE` description for each table, including column names and types.^([5](ch03.html#id622)) We can also provide a few (for instance, three) example rows from the table.      Few-shot examples      Feeding the prompt with few-shot examples of question-query matches can improve the query generation accuracy. This can be achieved by simply appending standard static examples in the prompt to guide the agent on how it should build queries based on questions.      See [Figure 3-11](#ch03_figure_11_1736545666780807) for a visual of the process.  ![A close-up of a machine  Description automatically generated](assets/lelc_0311.png)  ###### Figure 3-11\\. A user’s query transformed to a SQL query    Here’s a full code example:    *Python*    ``` from langchain_community.tools import QuerySQLDatabaseTool from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase from langchain.chains import create_sql_query_chain from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI  # replace this with the connection details of your db db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///Chinook.db\") llm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4\", temperature=0)  # convert question to sql query write_query = create_sql_query_chain(llm, db)  # Execute SQL query execute_query = QuerySQLDatabaseTool(db=db)  # combined chain = write_query | execute_query  # invoke the chain chain.invoke('How many employees are there?'); ```py    *JavaScript*    ``` import { ChatOpenAI } from \"@langchain/openai\"; import { createSqlQueryChain } from \"langchain/chains/sql_db\"; import { SqlDatabase } from \"langchain/sql_db\"; import { DataSource } from \"typeorm\"; import { QuerySqlTool } from \"langchain/tools/sql\";  const datasource = new DataSource({   type: \"sqlite\",   database: \"./Chinook.db\", // here should be the details of your database }); const db = await SqlDatabase.fromDataSourceParams({   appDataSource: datasource, }); const llm = new ChatOpenAI({ model: \"gpt-4\", temperature: 0 });  // convert question to sql query const writeQuery = await createSqlQueryChain({ llm, db, dialect: \"sqlite\" });  // execute query const executeQuery = new QuerySqlTool(db);  // combined const chain = writeQuery.pipe(executeQuery);  // invoke the chain await chain.invoke('How many employees are there?'); ```py    We first convert the user’s query to a SQL query appropriate to the dialect of our database. Then we execute that query on our database. Note that executing arbitrary SQL queries on your database generated by an LLM from user input is dangerous in a production application. To use these ideas in production, you need to consider a number of security measures to reduce the risk of unintended queries being run in your database. Here are some examples:    *   Run the queries on your database with a user with read-only permissions.           *   The database user running the queries should have access only to the tables you wish to make available for querying.           *   Add a time-out to the queries run by this application; this would ensure that even if an expensive query is generated, it is canceled before taking up too many of your database resources.              This is not an exhaustive list of security considerations. Security of LLM applications is an area currently in development, with more security measures being added to the recommendations as new vulnerabilities are discovered.    # Summary    This chapter discussed various state-of-the-art strategies to efficiently retrieve the most relevant documents based on a user’s query and synthesize them with your prompt to aid the LLM to generate an accurate, up-to-date output.    As discussed, a robust, production-ready RAG system requires a wide range of effective strategies that can execute query transformation, query construction, routing, and indexing optimization.    Query transformation enables your AI app to transform an ambiguous or malformed user query into a representative query that’s optimal for retrieval. Query construction enables your AI app to convert the user’s query into the syntax of the query language of the database or data source where structured data lives. Routing enables your AI app to dynamically route the user’s query to retrieve relevant information from the relevant data source.    In [Chapter 4](ch04.html#ch04_using_langgraph_to_add_memory_to_your_chatbot_1736545668266431), we’ll build on this knowledge to add memory to your AI chatbot so that it can remember and learn from each interaction. This will enable users to “chat” with the application in multiturn conversations like ChatGPT.    ^([1](ch03.html#id547-marker)) Patrick Lewis et al., [“Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks”](https://oreil.ly/Qzd2K), arXiv, April 12, 2021\\.    ^([2](ch03.html#id572-marker)) Xinbei Ma et al., [“Query Rewriting for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models”](https://oreil.ly/zyw5E), arXiv, October 23, 2023\\.
