    want to communicate through a story. Extracting an insight from data is the most
    difficult task every data analyst must deal with. In the previous chapters, you
    learned that to turn data into information, you must extract insights from data.
    You also learned that an insight is something relevant you have found in your
    data. In this book, we will not focus on how to extract insights from data. Tons
    of books exist on the topic, so you can refer to them for a detailed description
    (see, e.g., Guja et al., 2024; De Mauro et al., 2021). In this chapter, we will
    follow a more intuition-based approach to extract an insight, describing the motivations
    guiding you while exploring data. I hope this approach will help you to broaden
    your point of view during your data analysis journey. Thus, the objective in this
    chapter is to understand that at the base of the DIKW pyramid, there is the extraction
    of an insight, its transformation into a character of a story, and its representation
    through a chart. First, we will focus on how to extract insights from data using
    an intuitive approach. Next, we’ll describe how to choose the characters of a
    data story and how to choose the right chart. The story characters and the right
    chart help to communicate your insight to an audience. Finally, you’ll learn how
    to implement some of the most popular data visualization charts in Altair. We’ll
    exploit the power of Copilot to speed up the chart construction process and provide
    the code to implement decluttered charts, ready to be added to a data story.

    Lidenbrock (1864) meticulously extracts information from a medieval Icelandic
    manuscript by employing his keen intellect and passion for exploration. With a
    deep understanding of languages, history, and geology, he deciphers cryptic clues,
    cross-references ancient texts, and applies scientific knowledge to unravel the
    secrets concealed within the pages. The manuscript provides details about the
    journey’s route and the geological landmarks they would have encountered along
    the way. In other words, Professor Otto Lidenbrock turns the data contained in
    the old manuscript into information.

    you can extract an insight simply by looking at the pieces of data you already
    have in a different way. To explain how the connection strategy works, consider
    the following scenario. Angelica is a data analyst working for an e-commerce website.
    One day, Angelica receives a report on customer reviews and ratings for each product
    on the website. Each product is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, and customers can
    leave text reviews. Table 6.1 shows the sales dataset Angelica must analyze.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A *coincidence* is an occurrence of events that happen at the same time due
    to randomness but which seem to have some connection—the unexpected convergence
    of two or more apparently significant situations, even though they may be disconnected.
    Coincidences can range from everyday events, like meeting someone you know in
    an unexpected place, to extraordinary events that seem incredibly unlikely. However,
    while coincidences are intriguing, they do not necessarily indicate anything beyond
    chance. They could be rare or unusually timed events capturing our attention due
    to their curious alignment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In his book, *Seeing What Others Don’t*, Gary Klein says, “Observing a coincidence
    means that we’ve spotted some events that seem related to each other even though
    they don’t seem to have any obvious causal link.” You should take a skeptical
    approach and consider something a coincidence (and, thus, ignore it) when it is
    an isolated incident with few data points to evidence a relationship between two
    variables. On the other hand, when events or trends repeat on multiple occasions,
    they should be considered less likely to be coincidental and, thus, worth investigating
    further.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To identify whether a repeated event is a coincidence or not, you could approach
    data with a deliberately skeptical mindset, ignoring isolated events, while looking
    for longer-term patterns that would suggest a relationship. The presence of correlated
    factors could indicate a potential causal relationship. For instance, by analyzing
    data over time, you might discover that certain variables precede the repeated
    event, hinting at a cause-and-effect dynamic. Through causality, you could distinguish
    between mere coincidences and meaningful connections, explaining the mechanisms
    governing the observed phenomenon.

    orders peak every Friday. This could be a coincidence, but the repetitiveness
    of the event should be considered. For example, Angelica might find that every
    Friday, there is an exciting radio show that causes people to rush to buy new
    headphones. Or she might find out that there’s a law in her town on Fridays that
    doesn’t allow speakers to be turned on. In any case, this repetitiveness of events
    requires further analysis.

    while studying staphylococci bacteria. One day, while he was meticulously examining
    his petri dishes filled with these microorganisms, he noticed something peculiar.
    A petri dish left open by mistake had become contaminated with mold. Intrigued
    by this unexpected occurrence, Fleming examined the petri dish closely. To his
    astonishment, he observed that the bacteria surrounding the mold were gradually
    deteriorating. Something unleashed by the mold was defeating them. Driven by curiosity,
    Fleming embarked on a series of experiments to explore this phenomenon. He carefully
    isolated the mold and extracted the substance it produced, which he named penicillin.
    Curiosity prompted Fleming to investigate the problem further, leading him to
    the discovery of penicillin, the world’s first antibiotic, saving countless lives
    and transforming medicine forever.

    innovation, pushing us to question, seek answers, and expand the boundaries of
    knowledge. Curiosity is one strategy we can apply to extract insights. Curiosity
    about data can be triggered by a wide range of phenomena, including outliers,
    missing data, data gaps across time or space, sudden shifts or trends, unexpected
    patterns, and much more. When we note something curious in our data, we dig deeper,
    ask questions, and explore the underlying factors contributing to the observed
    patterns. This curiosity drives us to analyze the data from different angles,
    uncover hidden insights, and ultimately gain a deeper understanding of the phenomena.

    have contributed to this spike, such as marketing efforts, special promotions,
    or external events. As we proceed in the research, curiosity may spur us to add
    other factors, such as customer demographics during this period. This investigation

    conflict, creating an inconsistency. According to Gary Klein, to extract insight
    from contradictions, you must approach the data with a skeptical mindset. Unlike
    a coincidence-based approach, where we look for repeating events, in the case
    of a contradiction-based strategy, we look for seemingly conflicting events. An
    insight extracted from contradictions can disrupt conventional thinking, challenge
    established notions, and provide alternative perspectives that foster creative
    problem solving. By embracing the inherent tension within contradictions, you
    can gain valuable insights, leading to breakthroughs, innovation, and growth.

    event is quite contradictory because the general assumption is that a price increase
    should correspond to a decrease in sales. However, to understand this phenomenon,
    you could wear the skepticism lens and analyze this contradictory phenomenon more
    deeply. One possible motivation you could discover is the perceived value. When
    prices increase, customers may perceive your product as more exclusive, high quality,
    or desirable. This perception of increased value can make customers willing to
    pay more, leading to increased sales. An alternative explanation could be the
    sense of urgency among consumers who may fear missing out on the product, believing
    the higher price signifies scarcity or limited availability. Another reason may
    be inflation. In the context of inflation, when prices rise, people may buy more
    for fear that the prices may rise even more, making the product unattainable.

    this category of charts only to represent numerical values. Lately, I have seen
    an unfounded opposition to these types of charts on social media and the web.
    The main argument is that these graphs are too generic and do not convey the results
    correctly. I was a victim of this sentiment, and for a while, I avoided this type
    of chart as well. Then, one fine day, on LinkedIn, I read a post ([https://mng.bz/NRpD](https://mng.bz/NRpD))
    by Brent Dykes reevaluating cooking charts, especially pie charts. In his post,
    Dykes pointed out that pie charts aren’t great at representing the precise dimensions
    of the slices, but they do represent the parts of the whole. Dykes explicitly
    says, “I know everyone likes rules. ‘Never use this chart type ...,’ ‘Always use
    this chart type for...,’ etc. However, it’s not always so straightforward in data
    storytelling. It isn’t just about how to display a certain type of data but how
    to best communicate a specific point to your audience.”

    of data points in a polar plot. The `Color` channel refers to encoding data using
    different colors.

    the United States. You have the aquaculture dataset ([https://data.world/agriculture/aquaculture-data](https://data.world/agriculture/aquaculture-data)),
    provided by the US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service (available
    under the CC-0 license). This dataset describes the exported kilograms and the
    dollars earned over time for each fish category, as shown in table 6.6.

    so far in salmon aquaculture are sufficient or should be improved. For simplicity,
    you base your study on this dataset. However, in a real situation, you should
    also consider other aspects, such as the costs to maintain these measures and
    other similar analyses.

    types of aquaculture. You can find the code associated with this case study in
    the GitHub repository for the book under CaseStudies/aquaculture/. Ask Copilot
    to generate the chart for you. Use the list of instructions described in the following
    listing to build the base chart.

    and apply some filters to select only the world exportations, in terms of dollars.
    Next, calculate the date from the `YEAR_ID` and the `TIMEPEROID_ID` column. Finally,
    plot the trend line in Altair.

    discover that since 1998, there has been an increase in sales, following a period
    of decrease in sales from 1992 to 1998\. Moved by curiosity on the decreasing
    period, you do some research and discover that the decreasing period was partially
    due to some health problems in the salmon aquaculture.

    described some techniques to extract insights. Next, we have seen how to select
    the characters of a story. Finally, we have learned how to use Copilot to implement
    some of the most popular charts in Altair. You can find other charts in the GitHub
    repository for the book under section 06/other-charts. In the next chapter, you
    will learn how to turn information into knowledge.
