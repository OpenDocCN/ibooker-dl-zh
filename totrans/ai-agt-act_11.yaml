- en: Although several commercial large language model (LLM) services are available,
    this book recommends using OpenAI services directly or through Azure OpenAI Studio.
    To access either service, you must create an account and register a payment method
    not covered in this appendix. The GPT-4 family of LLMs is considered best in class
    and better suited for agent development. Using open source and alternative services
    is always an option but generally only advisable after you’ve worked with GPT-4
    for some time.

    account and log in. If this is your first time creating an account, you’ll likely
    be given free credit in some amount. If you already have an account, you must
    register a payment method and type. It’s generally better to purchase a number
    of credits at a time. This will allow you to manage the costs better and avoid
    overruns.

    file or through other means of registering an OpenAI key. For most of the packages
    used in this book, configuring OpenAI will generally only require the key. Other
    services, such as Azure OpenAI, will require the configuration of a model deployment
    and a base URL as covered in the next section.
