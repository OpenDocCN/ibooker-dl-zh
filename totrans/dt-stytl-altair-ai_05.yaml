    extracted from data; the contextual background behind data; and the next steps
    connected to data, inviting the audience to do something. The data, information,
    knowledge, wisdom (DIKW) pyramid helps you consider all these aspects. In this
    part, you’ll deepen your understanding of all the steps of the DIKW pyramid.'

    first part of the chapter centers on a case study of homelessness and how to transform
    its data from a raw chart into a data story using the DIKW pyramid. The chapter
    also introduces some general concepts related to data storytelling, such as the
    structure of a narrative and the data storytelling arc. In the second part of
    the chapter, you will implement another case study, based on fake news.

    case study: the problem of safety in salmon aquaculture in the United States.
    At the end of each chapter, you’ll improve this case study with the concepts described
    in the chapter.'

    data into information. You’ll learn some basic techniques to extract and represent
    insights. The chapter also illustrates how to build the most common chart families:
    bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and geographical maps.'

    knowledge. You’ll learn how to add context to your data story. In chapter 7, you’ll
    focus on the textual context, and in chapter 8, on the visual context. You’ll
    also learn advanced concepts, such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and
    large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. Since these concepts are evolving continuously,
    it’s possible some may be outdated by the time you read this part. However, the
    overall theory is still valid, although the code syntax may differ.
