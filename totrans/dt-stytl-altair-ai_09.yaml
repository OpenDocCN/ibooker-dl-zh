    that strike us. Of course, written texts can arouse emotions, and the power of
    visual elements to generate emotions is likely even greater. So why not exploit
    emotions to involve the audience more in our data stories? In this chapter, we
    will review the basic concepts behind visual context in a data story with a focus
    on emotions. We will describe how to set color, size, and interactivity in a data
    story. Next, we will deepen the usage of DALL-E for building images. Afterward,
    we will focus on how to place the context in your chart. Finally, we will focus
    on a practical case study implementing the described concepts.

    still be talking about them after some time. They should be memorable. One way
    to achieve this, while directly involving our audience, is by eliciting *emotions*.
    Emotions are central to perceiving, interpreting, and remembering visual information.
    Emotions bridge the gap between raw data and human comprehension. Visual stimuli
    trigger emotional responses, influencing our perception and engagement with what
    we see. The *Collins Dictionary* ([https://mng.bz/9dZl](https://mng.bz/9dZl))
    defines an emotion as “a feeling such as happiness, love, fear, anger, or hatred,
    which can be caused by the situation that you are in or the people you are with.”'

    visual context, including colors, shapes, and layout, can evoke specific emotional
    responses in the audience. For instance, warm colors like red and orange might
    evoke feelings of excitement or urgency, while cooler tones like blue and green
    can convey calmness or trust. Intentionally using these emotional cues in visual
    elements can significantly impact how information is perceived and retained by
    the audience.

    data autonomously.
  prefs: []

- en: Adding interactive elements to a chart, such as buttons, menus, and zoom options,
    transforms a static chart into a dynamic one. With a dynamic chart, you build
    dynamic data stories, where the audience builds their own story. With a dynamic
    chart, you lose control over the audience and the possibility of having a focused
    and precise message. The audience is free to explore data and extract their insights,
    potentially leading to other calls to action. For this reason, it’s important
    to design in advance which parts of the charts you want to make browsable by the
    audience based on the message to communicate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Use interactive charts when you want the audience to explore data dynamically
    or when dealing with large datasets. For example, for financial data or in an
    educational context, an interactive chart allows the audience to zoom in on specific
    timeframes or hover over data points for details. Conversely, you may prefer static
    charts for simple presentations or reports where the data doesn’t require exploration.
    For instance, a static chart could be ideal for a printed annual report that presents
    trends or comparisons and doesn’t require user interaction. Additionally, in situations
    where the message needs to be straightforward and consistent, static charts may
    be more effective.

    the audience have a clear representation of the story’s subject. You will bring
    the audience up to the intended emotional level through images, especially photos,

    The objective is to encourage the audience to continue to adopt the current strategy
    for the sake of the salmon population. Instead of focusing on the negative effects,
    here, we can focus on the positive scenario, mentioning the negative aspects only
    as a possibility. We will use relaxing photos and colors.

    Positive, the charts highlights the trend line since 1998\. You can find the solution

    knowledge by adding visual context to your data visualization chart. You saw how
    to add emotions to your charts in terms of colors, size, and interactivity. You
    also learned how to generate mood-based and consistent images in DALL-E. Next,
    you learned where to put the context in your chart. Finally, you implemented a
    practical case study. In the next chapter, you will see how to turn knowledge
    into wisdom by adding a call to action and possible next steps to your chart.
