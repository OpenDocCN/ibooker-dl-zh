<h1>Foreword</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When I graduated from UCLA in the early 1990s, I thought I would be a professor. But when IBM hired me, I quickly fell in love with the technology industry. There was no turning back. I would go on to work at other companies like VMware, Pivotal, EMC, and SGI.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Then I founded several startups. My latest is Aisera, which builds generative AI solutions for enterprises. Our platform helps with customer service, employee experience, enterprise search, IT service desk, and AIOps.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Throughout my career, I’ve seen many innovations, such as the emergence of the internet, cloud computing, mobile devices, and deep learning. Yet there was one area of technology that saw little progress: software development.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As a founder, this was certainly a big frustration. There would often be certain things we wanted to do but could not because of the bottlenecks with our engineering teams. But with AI-assisted programming, the game has changed in a big way. It has made Aisera more agile and nimble. It’s been a force multiplier that has helped propel our growth.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Now, when I consider hiring a developer, I want to know how they leverage AI. How are they using this powerful technology to handle tedious processes and code faster? </p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Bottom line: I believe that understanding AI-assisted programming tools is a critical skillset. According to Microsoft CEO <a href="https://oreil.ly/CuREp">Satya Nadella</a>, they are “becoming standard issue for any developer…”</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>But understanding AI-assisted programming requires a different approach. It’s not like typical development. You need to understand how to use generative AI systems. This is where Tom’s book comes in. He has written a playbook for any developer who wants to become proficient with AI-assisted programming. He’s covered the key topics and has provided many useful examples. He also has done this in a fun manner, making the topic approachable.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>No doubt, it’s an exciting time to be a developer. There are many opportunities for career growth. And one of the best moves you can make is learning AI-assisted <span class="keep-together">programming</span>.</p>&#13;
