    to generate high-resolution color images. In particular, you’ll learn to use convolutional
    neural networks to capture spatial features in images. You’ll also learn to use
    transposed convolutional layers to upsample and generate high-resolution feature
    maps in images. In chapter 5, you’ll learn two ways to select characteristics
    in the generated images. In chapter 6, you’ll learn to build and train a CycleGAN
    to translate images between two domains such as images with black hair and images
    with blond hair or horse images and zebra images. In chapter 7, you’ll learn to
    create images using another generative model: autoencoders and their variant,
    variational autoencoders.'
