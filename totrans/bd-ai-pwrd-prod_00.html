<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a core area of research and development for computer scientists and engineers for decades. While the potential of AI remained constrained by hardware and software for years, recent breakthroughs have allowed product managers to harness AI’s power, scaling it into practical and impactful solutions.</p>

<p>In 2023, the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and similar large language models transformed the landscape of digital products, empowering product managers to infuse AI into user experiences in ways that were unimaginable just a year before. In the span of a year, the market has seen a Cambrian explosion of generative AI models, from image generation tools like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E to advanced search solutions like Deepseek—and even multimodal AI systems like Google’s Gemini. As of 2024, most tech companies are focused on integrating some aspect of AI into their products, with many prioritizing the transition from task-specific AI solutions to general-purpose AI and building new user experiences with multimodal AI and personalized AI agents.</p>

<p><em>Building AI-Powered Products: The Essential Guide to AI and GenAI Product Management</em> is a road map for navigating the complexities of creating AI-driven products. Drawing on my experiences at Google and Meta, and complemented by insights from the AI Product Academy, this guide aims to equip product managers, entrepreneurs, and business leaders with the tools and frameworks to confidently integrate AI into their work.</p>

<section class="pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="Why AI Product Management?" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="pr01_why_ai_product_management_1736793248749295">
<h1 class="less_space">Why AI Product Management?</h1>

<p>AI product management is uniquely challenging. Unlike traditional product development, AI systems are probabilistic, depend on high-quality data, and demand continuous learning and optimization. Concepts such as large language models, retrieval-augmented generation, and model fine-tuning are critical to understand, yet they often feel inaccessible to nontechnical PMs. This is why I founded the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI Product Academy" data-type="indexterm" id="id274"/>AI Product Academy, which provides AI Product Management certifications, and it is the reason I wrote this book: to bridge the gap between niche AI technologies and solve user pain points in impactful ways. The book offers actionable guidance, practical tools, and case studies to help you navigate the intricate AI Product Development Lifecycle, tackle strategic and ethical considerations, and build products that are both innovative and user centric.</p>

<h1>Who Should Read This Book?</h1>

<p>This book is for product leaders of all levels who want to learn how to manage, build, and land AI and generative AI-powered products as well as AI product organizations. I have designed the content to be relevant to different audiences, from technical professionals eager to explore AI’s possibilities, to business leaders looking to staff their own organizations with AI product leaders and gain a competitive edge. Approximately 8,000 professionals have taken my AI PM Bootcamp to date, and most of them fall into these three categories:</p>

<h1 class="less_space">What This Book Covers</h1>

<p>AI is not the product; the experience is the product. To bring value to users, AI needs to be integrated into an experience, enhancing it or contributing to solving an unmet need. This book is for building AI and generative AI experiences, from ideation to rollout. It is absolutely critical for anyone looking to collaborate with technical teams to bring AI products to life.</p>

<p>This book is structured to guide you through every stage of building AI-powered products, from initial ideation to market deployment:</p>
