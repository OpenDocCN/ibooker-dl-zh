<h1><span class="label">Part III. </span>LLM Application Paradigms</h1>


<p>In this part of the book, we shift our focus to the application layer. Until now, we have explored LLMs as standalone concepts, but we will now examine how they integrate into larger software systems. To this end, we will delve into popular application paradigms such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agents.</p>
