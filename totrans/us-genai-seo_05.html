      <h1><span class="label">Chapter 3. </span>Getting Started with Generative AI</h1>
      <p>You’ve seen the potential of generative AI to drive SEO growth for your organization. You’ve also seen plenty of problems that can arise from being too aggressive with using it. So what do you need to get started? That’s what we’ll address in this chapter.</p>
      <p>Unless you want to build your own generative AI system (we cover this topic in <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06_advanced_use_cases_for_generative_ai_in_seo_1748359259642070">Chapter 6</a>), you will likely use a variety of tools to create content. This chapter focuses on both the necessary and the optional tools for optimizing content creation. Every tool has its advantages and disadvantages, so this chapter explains what can be done with these tools and the pitfalls to avoid.</p>
      <p>For organizations that have content creation strategies, incorporating generative AI tools into those strategies requires changes to corporate procedures. Your writers, editors, and anyone else in the content-generation pipeline must learn to adjust. We’ll cover some of the concerns that you and your organization might have when generative AI is integrated into your content creation process.</p>
      <p>If you work with external contractors to help with writing, you should find out if the content they provide you was generated by AI. You’re paying them for their expertise, and you want to make sure you’re getting it. If AI-detection tools know that your content is machine generated, then Google can detect it as well. We cover these tools, show you how to use them, and discuss the pros and cons of using AI detection. </p>
      <p>As you’ll see throughout the chapter, there are limitations to what generative AI tools can do. Humans are required to review AI-generated content and fix any mistakes before finalizing the work. The final section of this chapter will provide examples of how you can do this.</p>

In the case of AI, several of your staff members may be concerned about changes to their job security or the impact on future employment. It’s important for organizations to start by educating staff on the ways that generative AI can speed up their job functions and make them more productive. Employees may also be concerned about learning a new and unfamiliar technology. Education is the key here, and there are many ways to provide that:</p>

            <dd>
              <p>Be open about what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. Communicate this with excitement about how it can help the company grow and the opportunities it will create.</p>

            </dd>
            <dt>Hold AI-specific training sessions</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Announce and hold meetings to train staff on how to use AI. These can be company-wide or one department at a time. Trainings can help people become comfortable with the strengths and weaknesses of AI as well as help them understand how to apply AI in their jobs.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Use “lunch and learns” to promote AI</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>These serve a similar purpose as the AI-specific training sessions but are meant to be supplemental. You can make them optional and use them to learn which of your employees are most interested in the topic.</p>

            <dt>Provide access to tools</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>The more your employees become familiar with using generative AI tools, the better. Grant them access with appropriate training so that they have that opportunity.

          <h2>Setting Expectations for Impact</h2>
          <p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_limitations_of_generative_ai_1748358211790682">“Limitations of Generative AI”</a>, we discussed<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="generative AI" data-secondary="setting ROI expectations for" id="gen-ai-roi-expect"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ROI (return on investment)" data-secondary="setting expectations for" id="roi-expect"/> many aspects of the shortcomings of generative AI tools. These issues mean that we can’t use the output of the tools without including expert human review. If you don’t incorporate this human review, you’re taking on a high risk with every output you apply from the tools within your business.</p>
          <p>Therefore, you can’t hand generative AI the keys to the bus and expect everything to come out well. You need to involve expert humans in reviewing all outputs. The key is to make sure that humans own the results of the work, regardless of how you use the tools. </p>
          <p>This limits the scope of the impact. For example, if you’re using generative AI to help you create content, here are some example expectations you might have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Cut content creation costs by 30%</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Increase throughput by 30%</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Improve quality by 20%</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The truth is that these results are pretty spectacular. If content creation is a large part of what your organization does, it would be a game changer for you. Note that your results may differ from these, but they do represent reasonable targets.</p>
          <p>To illustrate further, here are some <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SEO (search engine optimization)" data-secondary="use cases" id="seo-use-case-ch3"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="use cases for SEO" id="use-case-ch3"/>great activities that you could use generative AI to help you with:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Check the code of a web page for SEO problems</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>This is valuable if you understand its limitations. It may not catch all errors (“missed issues”), and it may report some things as errors that aren’t problems (“false positives”). <em>False positives</em> are<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="false positives" id="id537"/> alerts for errors that aren’t actually errors. You want true positives, which means your generative AI prompts correctly identify errors on the page. If you’ve written a good prompt, the missed issues and false positives will still happen from time to time, but the actual errors found (“true positives”) will be invaluable to you, and the missed issues and false positives are easily identified with human review. We discuss this use case more in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05_using_ai_to_assist_with_technical_seo_1748358218128343">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

            <dt>Write schema code</dt>

              <p>This provides the developer with a draft of code to review and finalize. It’s better than starting with a blank sheet of paper! We also discuss this use case more in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05_using_ai_to_assist_with_technical_seo_1748358218128343">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

              <p>You can also use generative AI to assist with writing content because it can provide the writer with something to start with other than a blank sheet of paper.

            <h3>Must-Dos</h3>
            <p>Here are the critical elements of effective prompting:</p>
            <dl>
              <dt>Identify your target audience</dt>

                <p>Your <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="target audience, identifying in prompts" id="id542"/>prompt should provide this information so that the generative AI tools can tune their responses accordingly. Just a few examples of target audiences are second-grade students, buyers of equipment for industrial kitchens, developers looking for sample source code, parents of newborn children, and nuclear physicists. You can be extremely specific or more general, depending on the nature of what you’re trying to do.</p>
              </dd>
              <dt>Establish your persona</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>This is <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="persona, establishing" id="id543"/>similar to your brand voice. Do you want to sound authoritative, academic, lighthearted, friendly? The tools are generally good at adapting to these types of instructions. An example might be: “You are a manufacturer of lawn tractors for industrial use, and the content you write should be authoritative in tone but easy to read.”</p>
              </dd>
              <dt>Provide context</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Provide <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="context, providing in prompts" id="id544"/>your generative AI tool with additional info about your target audience. For example, if you’re targeting parents of newborn children, are they looking for advice? Or something to buy to fill a need? Let the AI know what your target audience wants to see.</p>
              </dd>
              <dt>Dos and don’ts</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Clearly detail in your prompt what you want the generative AI to do and what you don’t want it to do. For example: “Give me a biography of Winston Churchill, but don’t give me information about his childhood.” <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_1_1748358213996450">Figure 3-1</a> shows this prompt and a portion of the response received from Gemini.</p>

That means that once you get a response to your initial prompt, you can provide input on how you would like to tweak it. For example, perhaps you asked for a bio of Danny Sullivan and got a bio for Danny Sullivan the search expert, which wasn’t what you wanted. If so, you can try something like “Please update your response to focus on Danny Sullivan the race car driver.” You can see this illustrated in the figures in the following section, <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_an_example_of_iterative_prompting_1748358214008583">“An Example of Iterative Prompting”</a>.  The tool will then give you an updated response. You can also make simpler iterations, such as “Please don’t use so many superlatives in your response.”</p>

                <p>Each of the major generative AI tools has its special features. These features may address specific needs that you have for your project. For example, as of this writing, ChatGPT is beta testing features for automation that enable you to have it execute tasks on a specific schedule. For example, you can use this feature to summarize the latest AI news on a daily basis for you. Which features each tool has will change, so it makes sense to keep checking feature updates of each tool to find the one that best fits the needs of your particular projects.</p>

            <h3>Gotchas</h3>
            <p>The aforementioned elements of an effective prompt will provide a good start, but you also should avoid common errors. Some of these are:</p>

An example here might be “Tell me about life on Earth.” Instead, try something more specific, such as “Please tell me about the evolution of the early hominids” or “How did the first single-celled organisms come into existence on Earth?”</p>
              </dd>
              <dt>Over-specification</dt>

If you’re unclear, you’ll likely run into problems. For example, you ask, “What’s the best time to fly to Singapore?” This leaves us with many questions, such as:</p>

                  <p>Is the question about the time of day, day of the week, or time of year?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>A better way to ask might be “What is the best time to fly to Singapore from New York for a holiday during winter in New York?”</p>

            <p>Learning how to create great prompts takes practice, so allow some time for your team to practice and get good at doing it before you assign them to a critical project. Chances are that the knowledge of how to do this will be prevalent by the end of 2026, but for now, plan on a learning curve to develop this expertise. If someone works hard at this and experiments a lot, they can probably become pretty good within two to three months and have a high level of expertise within a year.</p>

          <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="An Example of Iterative Prompting"><div class="sect3" id="ch03_an_example_of_iterative_prompting_1748358214008583">
            <h3>An Example of Iterative Prompting</h3>
            <p>As we<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="iterative prompting" id="iterative-prompt"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="prompts" data-secondary="iterative" id="prompt-iterative"/> discussed previously, your first attempt with a prompt may not give you the results you’re looking for. That’s OK, though, as most generative AI tools are designed to be interactive. This means you can review the output you receive and then ask the tool to modify it. Let’s start with an example, shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_2_1748358213996489">Figure 3-2</a>, where we ask Claude 3 Opus, “Who is Danny Sullivan?”</p>
            <figure><div id="ch03_figure_2_1748358213996489" class="figure">
              <img src="assets/ugai_0302.png" width="1052" height="950"/>
              <h6><span class="label">Figure 3-2. </span>Initial response to the question “Who is Danny Sullivan?” by Claude 3 Opus</h6>
            </div></figure>
            <p>This looks like a pretty solid response, but unfortunately, we wanted the information to be about the famous race car driver, so let’s try telling Claude that and ask it to try again, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_3_1748358213996518">Figure 3-3</a>.</p>
            <figure><div id="ch03_figure_3_1748358213996518" class="figure">
              <img src="assets/ugai_0303.png" width="1048" height="954"/>
              <h6><span class="label">Figure 3-3. </span>Response to the question “Who is Danny Sullivan the race car driver?” by Claude 3 Opus</h6>
            </div></figure>
            <p>This is great, but our intended audience is 10-year-old children, so we’d like to adjust this more. Let’s try that with another request to Claude 3 Opus to tweak the output, shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_4_1748358213996542">Figure 3-4</a>.</p>
            <figure><div id="ch03_figure_4_1748358213996542" class="figure">
              <img src="assets/ugai_0304.png" width="1139" height="877"/>
              <h6><span class="label">Figure 3-4. </span>Response to “Who is Danny Sullivan?” modified for 10-year-olds</h6>
            </div></figure>
            <p>This looks pretty good, but it’s a bit long, so let’s ask Claude to shorten the response. You can see the results in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_5_1748358213996565">Figure 3-5</a>.</p>
            <figure><div id="ch03_figure_5_1748358213996565" class="figure">
              <img src="assets/ugai_0305.png" width="1310" height="763"/>
              <h6><span class="label">Figure 3-5. </span>Response to “Who is Danny Sullivan?” shortened to three paragraphs</h6>
            </div></figure>
            <p>As you can see, Claude 3 Opus complied with our request, but the response wasn’t quite what we expected since the third paragraph is quite long. It did what we asked but didn’t meet our intent, so let’s try one more tweak, shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_6_1748358213996587">Figure 3-6</a>.</p>
            <figure><div id="ch03_figure_6_1748358213996587" class="figure">
              <img src="assets/ugai_0306.png" width="1413" height="707"/>
              <h6><span class="label">Figure 3-6. </span>Response to “Who is Danny Sullivan?” shortened even more</h6>
            </div></figure>
            <p>You can keep tweaking the output until you get something very close to what you want. This process is helpful for people who are just learning how to prompt as it can show you how to write better initial prompts. As your prompting improves, notice that the output conveys your message much more accurately, including the right tone and style for your brand. Compare the generative AI responses before and after to identify improvements and to build a strategy behind generating the output that you want.</p>
            <p>In the case of our example, we could have specified that we wanted the race car driver and to target an audience of 10-year-old children up front. However, even experts at prompting should expect to do some of<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="iterative prompting" data-startref="iterative-prompt" id="id551"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="prompts" data-secondary="iterative" data-startref="prompt-iterative" id="id552"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="prompts" data-secondary="writing" data-startref="prompt-writing" id="id553"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="writing prompts" data-startref="write-prompt" id="id554"/> this iterative prompting.</p>

You can use generative AI to assist in creating content, but <a href="https://oreil.ly/F1VP0">the content must show expertise, experience, <span class="keep-together">authoritativeness,</span> and trustworthiness</a>. Google is actively working to detect AI-generated content to prevent it from ranking and polluting the quality of its search results. This means that the content you generate with AI may significantly damage your site’s ranking <span class="keep-together">potential.</span></p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Your writers may be misusing it</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>If you are paying external writers to create original content, you need to ensure that they are not providing you with poorly edited—or even unedited—AI-generated content. If they are, that could also harm your site’s SEO potential. As previously discussed, publishing poor-quality, AI-generated content could lead to a loss of authoritative signals sent to Google’s algorithms. Misuse of AI is also unethical because the dishonest writers are passing off AI-generated work as their own with the intention of receiving full compensation for it. </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Therefore, it’s critical to have processes to run all content you create for your site through AI detection before you publish it. </p>
        <p>Building your team’s skills in AI detection will require some investment on your part. There is no simple, guaranteed way to do this. You’ll need to make use of third-party tools to help you identify content that <em>may</em> be written by AI, and then your editors will need to review the content to check it for quality.</p>

          <p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_essential_background_on_generative_ai_1748358211788823">Chapter 2</a>, we discussed the limitations of the generative AI tools. Based on those, there are many major criteria that AI-detection tools look for. Some of these include:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Overt errors in the content</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>You can see examples in Figures <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch02.html#ch02_figure_11_1748358211760719">2-11</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch02.html#ch02_figure_12_1748358211760738">2-12</a>. The errors in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_figure_11_1748358211760719">Figure 2-11</a> might be harder for an AI detection tool to catch because this is also incorrect in many human-written articles on the web. However, <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_figure_12_1748358211760738">Figure 2-12</a> shows a more obvious error where you can’t find any human-written content on the web with that same mistake.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Odd word choices</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Generative AI tools are known for making unusual word choices when they create content. Sometimes the text comes through with an unusual number of adjectives and/or adverbs in it, or words get reused many different times in a block of text. A quick human review of the text will leave the reviewer feeling that the writing style is a bit odd.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Lack of variations in sentence length</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>AI-written content tends to have more consistent sentence length than human-written content. This is referred to as “burstiness.”</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Unnecessary duplication of content</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>AI-written content tends to repeat key points in a way that is not needed. You can see an example of this in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_figure_6_1748358211760614">Figure 2-6</a>.</p>
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>The tools aren’t perfect at detecting problems, but they will catch a decent percentage of content that has been written by AI. Be aware, however, that Google likely has a much more sophisticated process for detecting AI than the commercial tools<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI-generated content" data-secondary="detecting" data-startref="ai-content-detect" id="id555"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content generation" data-secondary="detecting AI-generated content" data-startref="content-create-detect-ai" id="id556"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="detecting AI-generated content" data-startref="detect-ai-content" id="id557"/> provide.</p>

        <h1>What Makes Content Valuable</h1>
        <p>It’s <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content generation" data-secondary="valuable content, criteria for" id="content-gen-value"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="valuable content, criteria for" id="value-content-criteria"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Google" data-secondary="valuable content, criteria for" id="google-value-content-criteria"/>important to take a moment to consider what makes content useful to users because this is the content that Google’s algorithms are designed to detect and rank. Understanding this can help you decide how best to use generative AI to assist in creating that type of content.</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
          <p>Google’s algorithms are by no means perfect, so there are times when they fail to rank the best content and may even rank poor-quality content. Nonetheless, Google works continuously to improve these algorithms, so it’s best to target making your content the best content.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Consider the search example shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_7_1748358213996610">Figure 3-7</a>. The query is “how to make French toast,” including the quotation marks around the text. Quotes around the text forces Google to return only pages with that exact string.</p>

          <h6><span class="label">Figure 3-7. </span>Forcing Google to return pages with an exact string</h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>Note that on the right side of the image, Google says that it has “about 85,000 results” for this query. That’s a lot of pages discussing how to make French toast! With that in mind, if you choose to create another page on this topic, what do you think the chances are that you’ll be bringing some new value about it to the web? The chances are slim.</p>
        <p>The reason for sharing this example is that it relates to what you get with AI-generated content. Since this content is a regeneration of things that the AI tool has seen on the internet, it can’t bring anything new to anyone. It’s all old information. Given this context, Google has little incentive to rank it in their search results.</p>
        <p>So what content does Google think is valuable? Google has provided some insight<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Search Quality Rater Guidelines (SQRGs)" id="id558"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SQRGs (Search Quality Rater Guidelines)" id="id559"/> by publishing their <a href="https://oreil.ly/XVt1T">Search Quality Rater Guidelines (SQRGs)</a>. These are guidelines that Google provides to people who manually evaluate the quality of Google’s search results (“Quality Raters”). These Quality Raters review Google’s search results, examine pages that earn <span class="keep-together">high-ranking</span> positions, and then score those pages. Based on these scores, Google can see how well its algorithms are doing at providing quality content in the results.</p>
        <p>We can use these guidelines to help us understand what content is high quality. Within these guidelines, Google exposes us to other concepts related to content quality. One of these is <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="EEAT (experience, expertise, authoritativeness, trustworthiness)" data-secondary="valuable content, determining" id="eeat-ch3"/>EEAT. These are metrics for evaluating the likelihood that the publishing site and author are good resources for the information they are providing. Based on Google’s guidelines, here is what each of the letters in EEAT means:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Experience</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Does<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="experience" data-seealso="EEAT" id="id560"/> the writer have firsthand or life experience with the topic? Of course, generative AI tools have no firsthand experience; all they do is spin off text based on what they have already seen published on the internet.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Expertise</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Does <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="expertise" data-seealso="EEAT" id="id561"/>the writer have the knowledge or skill to create quality content on the topic?</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Authoritativeness</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Do others <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="authoritativeness" data-seealso="EEAT" id="id562"/>in the market see the writer as an authority on the topic?</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Trust</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The SQRGs <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="trustworthiness" data-seealso="EEAT" id="id563"/>note that this is the most important of the EEAT signals because untrustworthy pages shouldn’t rank even if they score well on experience, expertise, and authoritativeness. </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Now let’s discuss <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI-generated content" data-secondary="EEAT for" id="id564"/>how EEAT would be viewed for AI-generated content:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Experience</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The AI has no real-world experience, so score this one as a zero.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Expertise</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The AI has no expertise either. The “knowledge” you see within generative AI responses is simply scraped from the web and regurgitated in a rewritten manner. The score for this metric would also be zero.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Authoritativeness</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>While many people are currently excited about how “smart” the tools are, this will likely fade as people get tired of all the errors, omissions, and other problems. Except in certain specific situations, Google will score this very low, too. In addition, if you’re using AI to be your “authority” on something, your actual authoritativeness in the market will erode.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Trust</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>It’s difficult to assess how much “trust” Google would put in an AI algorithm unless there is a specific reason to do so.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
          <p>As a reminder, in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_seo_in_the_age_of_generative_ai_1748358209375503">Chapter 1</a> we noted that EEAT isn’t a direct ranking factor, except for sites focused on health or financial topics, but the role of the Quality Raters is to indicate how they think content should be ranked, and they are expected to consider EEAT and many other factors related to content quality for all sites. The Google algorithm then uses other ranking signals to attempt to rank the best content first.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Not all <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI-generated content" data-secondary="as trusted results" data-secondary-sortas="trusted results" id="ai-gen-trust"/>AI-generated content is considered bad. There are examples of areas where Google has trusted AI-created content for quite some time. A couple of examples are weather-related and earnings report queries. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_8_1748358213996631">Figure 3-8</a> shows an example query for “Wells Fargo earnings report.”</p>
        <figure><div id="ch03_figure_8_1748358213996631" class="figure">
          <img src="assets/ugai_0308.png" width="1283" height="716"/>
          <h6><span class="label">Figure 3-8. </span>Wells Fargo earnings report query result in Google</h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>The information in the highlighted result is AI generated. Yet Google trusts this information because it’s a simple presentation of the data, and Investing.com has very high scores from an authoritativeness perspective.</p>
        <p>Another example is a sports play-by-play. If you have a favorite team that is playing while you’re out to dinner, you might pick up your phone and enter a quick query, such as “49ers play-by-play.” You’ll get a response back that is also AI generated.</p>
        <p>From Google’s perspective, these types of situations are OK because:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The content created was highly constrained by the data input into the algorithm.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The publishers of the content that Google chooses to rank in the search results have a demonstrated history of authoritativeness and trust.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ultimately, the <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI-generated content" data-secondary="as trusted results" data-secondary-sortas="trusted results" data-startref="ai-gen-trust" id="id565"/>idea of having AI create content isn’t a fundamental problem for Google. Poor-quality content is a problem for Google, and this is regardless of whether AI was involved in creating it or not. However, as we’ve discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_essential_background_on_generative_ai_1748358211788823">Chapter 2</a> and this chapter, when AI is used to create content, it’s prone to making mistakes, and since it only regurgitates what is already on the internet, it doesn’t provide new insights. These are issues for Google.</p>
        <p>With these things in mind, let’s now summarize the key things that Google is looking for in content:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Content that is unique and answers questions that other content on the web doesn’t</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Content that focuses on adding value to users </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
          <p>What “adding value” means depends heavily on user queries. Some users may be looking to buy something right now; in other cases, the user only wants information.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The E, E, and A parts of EEAT relate to these two concepts. As for trust, you can think of this as being strongly correlated with brand. A strong brand is something that many larger companies have, but individuals who are experts in their field can also have a strong brand. Users tend to associate a strong brand with credibility and trustworthiness. For that reason, it’s important to build a strong brand in your market—for your company, for your key SMEs, <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="EEAT (experience, expertise, authoritativeness, trustworthiness)" data-secondary="valuable content, determining" data-startref="eeat-ch3" id="id566"/>or for both.</p>
        <p>In summary, Google wants your content to add value to users. Re-creating content that already exists on the web, that has errors or omissions, or that doesn’t focus on providing value to users isn’t what Google is looking to rank on its search engine. If you choose to use generative AI to assist you in creating content, make sure that you address these concerns. We’ll talk about one of the most important components of doing that in the<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content generation" data-secondary="valuable content, criteria for" data-startref="content-gen-value" id="id567"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="valuable content, criteria for" data-startref="value-content-criteria" id="id568"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Google" data-secondary="valuable content, criteria for" data-startref="google-value-content-criteria" id="id569"/> next section.</p>

        <h1>Requiring Human Involvement</h1>
        <p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_essential_background_on_generative_ai_1748358211788823">Chapter 2</a> and this chapter, <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content generation" data-secondary="human involvement in" id="content-gen-humans"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human involvement in content generation" id="human-involvement"/>we have emphasized the need for deliberate human involvement whenever an AI tool is used. Although generative AI tools are very powerful, they are still prone to making mistakes that can only be caught by humans. You need to plan for SMEs on your team to review and finalize any and all AI-generated work. As a reminder, some of the issues to be concerned about include:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Errors</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>These are cases where generative AI provides false information.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Omissions</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>These are responses that forget to include important information.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Context misalignment</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Even after you carefully craft your prompt and include the context that you are looking for, the generative AI tool may still get it wrong.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Not fitting your brand voice</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Even if you provide brand-voice instructions in your prompts, the generative AI tool may still make mistakes with it.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Ultimately, your workflow should require human involvement to review and finalize the work. Here are some examples to illustrate how this should work:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>If you use AI to audit the SEO of a web page, have an experienced technical SEO professional review the findings for accuracy. Also have them check the web page for issues that the AI might have missed. These errors can range from not understanding the context of the code to failing to parse the code correctly, leading to false positives or missing issues completely.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If you use AI to write JSON code to support schema on a web page, have an experienced JSON programmer who understands schema coding check the code for accuracy before publishing it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If you use AI to generate an outline for an article you plan to write, have an SME review and update the outline before starting to write it. Better still, have the generative AI tool create three outlines and then have the SME fact-check and merge them into a more in-depth outline before starting to write the article.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These examples are only meant to illustrate the broader concept: you need to include humans in your content review, ideally in the form of an SME who will be responsible for the quality of the published content. This will require them to fact-check the output, correct errors, identify significant omissions, and remove content that doesn’t <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content generation" data-secondary="human involvement in" data-startref="content-gen-humans" id="id570"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human involvement in content generation" data-startref="human-involvement" id="id571"/>belong.</p>
