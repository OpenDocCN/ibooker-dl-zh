    Because making predictions is one way to give warning when we see ourselves drifting
    in dangerous directions. Because prediction is a useful way of pointing out safer,
    wiser courses. Because, most of all, our tomorrow is the child of our today.”

- en: It’s been an absolute pleasure to construct and write about such an inspiring
    framework. I can’t believe I’m already writing the afterword for this book, and
    I imagine you might feel the same way about being finished with reading it. At
    this moment, our quest in this book has concluded. However, your adventure in
    TensorFlow.js is now in motion.

- en: In this book, you covered a lot of fundamental and visual aspects of machine
    learning. If you were unfamiliar with machine learning, now you can go deeper
    into more advanced model architectures like sound, text, and generative models.
    While you’ve grasped a great deal of the underpinnings of TensorFlow.js, there’s
    an entire galaxy of possibility with various teams exploring alongside you.

    socially. Twitter hashtags like `#MadeWithTFJS` are consistently used to tag new
    and unique creations in TensorFlow.js. Google’s TensorFlow.js community leader,
    [Jason Mayes](https://twitter.com/jason_mayes), helps promote the hashtag at all
    his show-and-tell events, which are featured on the TensorFlow YouTube channel.
