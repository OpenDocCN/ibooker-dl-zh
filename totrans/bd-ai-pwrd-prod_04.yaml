    AI innovation and seamlessly integrate it into user experiences. But let’s put
    that role into the broader context of an organization. Where exactly do you fit
    in as an AI PM, and how will your responsibilities shift as you move up the ladder?

    road map with the company’s overall business objectives. The work of AI PMs can
    vary significantly depending on their level within the organization. This brings
    us to [Figure 4-1](#ch04_figure_1_1736793247311730), a high-level map of AI product
    management tasks across different levels inspired by larger organizations. As
    you explore it, identify where your current role aligns to understand what a successful
    product approach could look like for you and your team. Keep in mind, however,
    that these levels are meant for illustrative purposes. Roles and responsibilities
    can vary widely from company to company, and your specific role may be a blend
    of several management levels.

    reflects the on-the-ground nature of execution-level roles. As you move up, the
    focus shifts to developing strategy, prioritizing use cases, and managing the
    AI deployment pipeline, indicating a transition toward shaping how AI will drive

    managers (APMs) up to group PMs. If you find yourself in this layer, your focus
    is on the day-to-day development and deployment of AI products and features. You’re
    the one working closely with AI/ML engineers and data scientists, tracking progress,
    removing roadblocks, and shipping AI capabilities. At this stage, your work revolves
    around setting Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), identifying product–market fit,

    performance and ensuring data quality—key areas where execution-level AI PMs spend
    much of their time. For example, if you’re building a personalized content recommendation
    system (as we briefly discussed in [Chapter 3](ch03.html#ch03_essential_ai_pm_knowledge_1736793246808259))
    for a platform like Netflix (as mentioned in the figure), your work will involve

    development to setting the product strategy and leading the organization. Working
    at Meta and Google, I’ve observed how big tech companies have trended toward consolidating
    roles. The ladder becomes shorter as companies focus on having a small number
    of senior leaders who define the product direction and vision (top layers) and
    select managers who handle execution (bottom layers).

    overall business strategy and managing an entire AI product portfolio. This involves
    a lot of cross-functional work, ensuring that AI efforts are strategically aligned
    with company goals, governance policies, ethics, and compliance. For example,
    Google oversees its AI initiatives across a diverse suite of products (Assistant,
    Search, Maps, Translate, etc.), ensuring that data practices align with regulatory

    leadership involves embedding AI across all units of the company, securing multibillion-dollar
    investments, and establishing company-wide responsible AI governance frameworks.
    The responsibilities here include ethical considerations, ensuring that data practices
    are compliant, and maintaining the integrity of AI models. The difference between
    these levels isn’t just in scope; it’s also in the strategic mindset required.

    prioritization, and resource allocation. Once you reach a certain level of seniority
    in your career, your primary job is not always about figuring out the best solution.
    What is most important is understanding what the opportunities are, making sure
    you have the right team to capitalize on those opportunities, and then setting
    those people up for success.

    in software possibilities with AI, the fundamentals of true product management
    become even more important. That’s focusing on customer needs and making sure
    that you are bringing the right solutions to market. Users don’t care about what
    technology is used. They care about which product meets their needs.

    policy, and academia. As a professor, I authored the most cited paper on the policy
    implications of AI and computer vision, published in the Harvard Journal of Law
    and Technology. My research at Stanford and Harvard opened doors to speak at the
    White House, the UN Internet Governance Forum, and other intellectually stimulating
    events. Yet, I always felt something was missing in my work. Returning to industry
    as a Director at the Wikimedia Foundation, I had two significant opportunities
    to dive into product management: (1) leading the product, research, and design
    team to develop strategy recommendations for improving the Wikipedia readership
    experience; and (2) spearheading the transition of Wikipedia to encrypted access
    (HTTPS by default).'

    unicorn disrupting manufacturing and enabling previously impossible designs—most
    notably the Adidas shoe with a lattice structure. This role was a crash course
    in product management, spanning software, hardware, and materials science, all
    supported by an in-house R&D lab. I worked on various AI-enabled products before
    founding Kraftful, where I now build AI products for product managers, combining

    Running an AI startup right now feels like sprinting at the speed of light—yet
    somehow never fast enough. I reflected on this yesterday while rebuilding our
    AI analysis with the latest large language models. This involves experimenting
    with new prompts and parameters of the latest large language models, work I usually
    tackle on weekends when I’m not in meetings. During the week, I share my findings
    with our engineers, who then build the architecture to scale the prompt chain
    I’ve developed. This sparks frequent impromptu meetings to review results and
    fine-tune our approach.

    spent talking with customers via calls or Intercom, gaining insights into how
    we can make Kraftful better. This is especially critical when building an AI product
    that has never existed before—our customers refine their requirements as they
    use it, helping us adapt and improve in real time.

    like machine learning, natural language processing, and neural networks. You don’t
    need to be an AI engineer, but you should be comfortable discussing these technologies
    with your team. Your role is to translate complex AI capabilities into solutions
    that users find valuable and easy to adopt. Most importantly, focus on building
