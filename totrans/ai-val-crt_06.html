<h1><span class="label">Chapter 6. </span>Skills That Thrill</h1>

<p>You might be tempted to skip this chapter<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="skilling" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_skilling6351"/> because it isn’t explicitly about AI. The irony? This chapter is all about the business of AI. The painful truth is you have no chance of getting as far as you should on your AI journey if you don’t get the skills right, both for you as an individual and collectively for your organization, and that’s why we put this chapter in this book.</p>

<p>There doesn’t seem to be an engagement that goes by where we don’t field a question like: How do I keep my skills sharp to differentiate myself? How can we keep our organizations’ skills current enough so we don’t get left behind? When it comes to AI upskilling, do I build or buy? (A simple question that opens discussions about a range of topics, from upskilling programs to an evaluation of your enterprise’s recruitment strategy.)</p>

<p>Back in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03_equations_for_generative_ai_persuasion_1740182046765298">Chapter 3</a>, we gave you some equations for AI persuasions. We start this chapter with another (courtesy of Dr. Paul W. Osmon):</p>

<ul class="simplelist center">
	<li>
	<p><strong>KNOWLEDGE × EFFORT = SUCCESS</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s like Newton’s third law of motion (every action creates an equal and opposite reaction): every bit of knowledge, with effort applied, creates an equal unstoppable force toward success. But if you have knowledge alone without effort, or effort alone without knowledge, you’re definitely going to come up short of your skill goals. It’s basically physics, applied to humanity’s aptitude to learn.</p>

<p>We’re confident that when you’re done reading this chapter, you’ll have gained the knowledge to begin putting skilling priorities into practice for you personally and for your company. From here, add sustained effort (reading this book is a good start, but it’s just a start) and you’ll be well on the way to personal and professional success.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Let the Skilling Begin" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch06_let_the_skilling_begin_1740182050334482">
<h1>Let the Skilling Begin</h1>

<p>In a cutting-edge, fast-paced, constantly changing area like AI<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="skilling" data-secondary="planning" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_skillingplanning61375"/>, employees with the required knowledge, skill sets, and experience are rare. In this GenAI and agentic era, we will see a rapid expansion in the need for highly specialized skills like modelers, engineers, data wranglers, and more. But this is not where it ends. When it comes to completely changing the way your business operates (shift left, shift right, get to AI+), there will be other very strong skill factors at play too—get this right or risk not moving your organization forward at the pace needed to get the most out of your AI journey. We’ve seen many companies buy skills (acquire a small company or go on a hiring spree) and fold them into their organizations, yet these actions didn’t result in an enterprise-wide change to the overall skills posture. Why? To thrive in the GenAI game, skills need to be looked at as overall organizational capability so <em>everyone</em> can lift their portion of the business. This means there are other talent-related factors at play, such as company culture and organizational silos, which can all pose major problems when it comes to AI adoption.</p>

<p>Future-proofing your organization to thrive requires an intentional skilling plan. If you are at the beginning of your skills journey, do not panic. This chapter will lay out the thinking to help you begin to frame your plan of attack.</p>

<p>Skills at an enterprise level can be categorized generally into a few main buckets:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Business critical (think: those at the very core to a business strategy)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Role specific (think: department, job family, etc.)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Core “soft” skills (think: collaboration, design thinking, industry, communication, etc.)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Technical skills (think: minimally comfortable in low-code environments, <span class="keep-together">coding</span>, model building, etc.)</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>While these are important, the scope of this particular chapter is on the technical skills. And don’t be misled into the false belief that technical skills are needed only for your developers—with GenAI and agents, every role will be influenced, improved, and disrupted—perhaps even more so for non-technical roles.</p>

<p>And finally, dear reader, to thrive, you need a robust skills program. One that includes a blend of all your skills, but is also clearly calibrated to fuel the technical innovations ahead. This is not a one-and-done training session, or an intensive three-day all-hands at a fancy offsite, and it’s not something you can just hire into a new position. Long-term success will require a plan, access to lots of content and hands-on environments, and a personal and continued commitment to the investment of upskilling.</p>

<p>The good news is, like any innovation, adopting new skills<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Innovation Adoption Lifecycle" data-type="indexterm" id="id823"/> can be mapped to the <a href="https://oreil.ly/hY-hg">Innovation Adoption Lifecycle curve</a> (also known as the <span class="keep-together">Rogers</span> bell curve) in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch06_figure_1_1740182050310362">Figure 6-1</a>.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 6-1. </span>The Innovation Adoption Lifecycle curve</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Companies that have made progress on their GenAI journeys know upskilling<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="upskilling" data-secondary="prioritizing" data-type="indexterm" id="id824"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="governance" data-secondary="upskilling priority" data-type="indexterm" id="id825"/> is important. Our client-engagement observations are validated in Gartner’s <em>Lessons from Generative AI Early Adopters</em> report<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch06.html#id826" id="id826-marker">1</a></sup> where respondents noted how upskilling existing staff with GenAI skills was the top method to address their talent needs for their future. What’s more, this same report put the importance of AI upskilling for the business above an AI governance strategy! This resonates with us because how can you have a strategy if you don’t know (per <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_ai_to_ai_generative_ai_and_the_netscape_moment_1740182043982974">Chapter 1</a>) what problems you are walking by every day that you can solve (or make better) with technology?</p>

<p>So where would you plot your own skills journey? We want you to think of this chapter as a primer on getting started the right way. While early adopters have a lot to say about the importance of skills, saying something is important and moving the needle on it are two <em>very</em> different things. A lot of companies are struggling with skills right now. But the one thing that surely unites us all (early adopter or yet to adopt) is an understanding that we’ve gone through a few technology inflection points these last decades—and as the rate of these technological inflection points come faster and faster, we’re getting better at spotting them.</p>

<p class="fix_tracking">You’re reading this book because you already know what we know: this GenAI and agentic inflection point is a doozy! So, if you’re trying to make a better skills program to support your AI initiatives or you’re just about to start, this chapter is going to help you.</p>

<p>Truth be told, we haven’t seen enough strategic reskilling<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="reskilling, importance of" data-type="indexterm" id="id827"/> action—and we say this for businesses, educational institutions, government agencies, and more. We’re <span class="keep-together">convinced</span> it takes purposeful motions to get a true grasp of a workforce’s current skill level. And quite honestly, this just isn’t happening with the eminence that’s needed in the public and private sector. In fact, a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch06.html#id828" id="id828-marker">2</a></sup> noted that just “15% of leaders believe that learning constitutes a core part of their company’s overall business strategy” and “only a handful of companies indicate that they have a structured process for forecasting skills gaps based on corporate business needs.” Say whaaaat? (The repeating “a” is not a typo, it’s our reaction.)</p>

<p>What’s more, this report noted that only 24% of respondents made a clear connection between corporate strategy and reskilling efforts. We’ll be blunt: Organizations! <em>Stop</em> seeing upskilling<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="value generator versus cost center, AI as" data-type="indexterm" id="id829"/> as a cost center—it’s the <em>ultimate value creator</em>. Well-trained developers or cloud engineers could learn how to properly assess applications to forecast how many tokens they will use; well-trained marketers will rethink marketing copy and put agentic AI to work to assist them with campaigns, asset designs, ad buys, and getting new insights on which initiatives are fueling meaningful engagements; well-trained sales associates will be more creative and collaborative partners with your clients and spend less time on internal preparation and paperwork. The impact of upskilling everyone is vast—the realization that it’s time for change and deciding to move the needle? Now that’s leadership! Remember our tip from earlier: technology is easy, culture is hard.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>At IBM, we have a special recognition for our top sellers, called The Golden Circle<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Golden Circle (IBM)" data-type="indexterm" id="id830"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="IBM" data-secondary="Golden Circle" data-type="indexterm" id="id831"/>. If you make it, you’re considered an exemplary performer who consistently demonstrates a dedication to client excellence and commitment to delivering outstanding measurable outcomes (it’s more than making 100% of your quota) that drive growth for IBM. The reward is an all-expenses paid trip for you and a guest that makes you feel like “Game of Thrones” royalty, only without the fear of being killed. We grabbed some stats on the characteristics that make for a Golden Circle seller. One of <em>the top</em> predictors that jumped off the page was learning: Golden Circlers learned more, completed their assigned learning journeys (faster than their peers too), <em>and</em> made their own learning plans. This one is a doozy. And as you’ll find out later in this chapter, you have to hire the curious because getting properly upskilled takes a mix of an enterprise skills program and people going out and finding the skills they need on their own. But the takeaway is obvious—Golden Circlers get a chance to work on their tans because they are clearly curious<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_skillingplanning61375" data-type="indexterm" id="id832"/>!</p>

<h1>The Path to AI+ Requires Scaling Skills Across a <span class="keep-together">Broad Spectrum of Roles</span></h1>

<p>To effectively close the data literacy divide<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="skilling" data-secondary="scaling of skills" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_skillingscalingofskills64857"/>, it’s imperative that organizations empower their workforce with streamlined access to education, data, intuitive tools, and practical applications <em>tailored</em> to their roles. This approach significantly reduces the time spent navigating data challenges, thereby elevating organizational productivity and efficiency.</p>

<p>If a picture tells a thousand words, <a data-type="xref" href="#ch06_figure_2_1740182050310400">Figure 6-2</a> is a visual summary of the business case for this chapter (and debatably why you are reading this book).</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch06_figure_2_1740182050310400"><img alt="A graph of a graph with blue and purple lines  Description automatically generated" src="assets/aivc_0602.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 6-2. </span>The inverse relationship between data literacy and population across roles</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Take note<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data producers, upskilling of" data-type="indexterm" id="id833"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="upskilling" data-secondary="data producers" data-type="indexterm" id="id834"/> of the data scientists, developers, and data engineers on the left side of <a data-type="xref" href="#ch06_figure_2_1740182050310400">Figure 6-2</a>; these are a cohort of the most data-literate individuals within a typical organization. They possess the technical skills to handle complex data and extract valuable insights, which are crucial for informed decision making and strategic <span class="keep-together">initiatives</span>.</p>

<p>Moving toward the right of <a data-type="xref" href="#ch06_figure_2_1740182050310400">Figure 6-2</a>, note the transition to data consumer roles<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data consumer roles, and upskilling" data-type="indexterm" id="id835"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="business data consumers, and upskilling" data-type="indexterm" id="id836"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="upskilling" data-secondary="data consumers" data-type="indexterm" id="id837"/>; you might know them as business analysts and business data consumers. Data consumers may not have the same level of technical data expertise as a data producer, but their success (and the success of the business, for that matter) are increasingly reliant on data for their day-to-day operations. The reason why we detailed data as a product and information architecture (IA—it helps AI) in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_oh_to_be_an_ai_value_creator_1740182046162988">Chapter 2</a> is because this cohort includes professionals from a company’s marketing department, HR, and so on. These roles require high-quality data that’s readily accessible and understandable, emphasizing the need for robust data management and governance systems.</p>

<p>The shift in data literacy<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data literacy" data-type="indexterm" id="id838"/> across the roles in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch06_figure_2_1740182050310400">Figure 6-2</a> signifies the need for different kinds of data access and interpretation tools, as not all users have the same expertise in data manipulation. Organizations must ensure that these users can easily locate, comprehend, and apply data to their work, thereby reducing time spent on data-related challenges and enhancing overall productivity<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_skillingscalingofskills64857" data-type="indexterm" id="id839"/>.</p>

<h1>AI—Job Destroyer or Job Creator?</h1>

<p>We get asked this all the time<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="skilling" data-secondary="and AI as job destroyer versus creator" data-secondary-sortas="AI as job destroyer versus creator" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_skillingandAIasjobdestroyerversuscreator66042"/>, and like we said earlier in this book, we think of AI as a net new-collar job creator. With that said, we thought we’d spend a bit of time flushing out why we think this and give some examples that might put your minds at ease when it comes to concerns over jobs. There is no question about it, we’ll reiterate: no more blue- or white-collar jobs. From the boiler room to the board room, there will only be new-collar jobs and they are all going to be heavily influenced by AI. So yes, we know you’ve heard it before: AI won’t replace you, but people using AI will. In fact, we think that if you don’t upskill your company, AI isn’t going to hurt or put you out of business, but another company implementing the techniques we’ve outlined in this book will. The bottom line is that when you consider how every job will be impacted by AI, for sure there will be upheavals.</p>

<p>Anxiety around technology inflection points isn’t anything new. Let’s go back to 1589, as we mentioned in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03_equations_for_generative_ai_persuasion_1740182046765298">Chapter 3</a>, when Queen Elizabeth I refused to grant the inventor of the mechanical knitting machine a patent out of fear it would put knitters out of work. Hindsight is 20/20, as they say—and we know that mechanical knitting machines help sparked the first industrial revolution, which led to explosive economic growth and real estate expansion. Now think back to US President Woodrow Wilson and his famous 1907 speech we referenced in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03_equations_for_generative_ai_persuasion_1740182046765298">Chapter 3</a> as well. Like we said, these concerns aren’t that new.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="You’re Only Going to Get Checkmated if You Don’t Up Your Skills" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch06_you_re_only_going_to_get_checkmated_if_you_don_t_u_1740182050334692">
<h2>You’re Only Going to Get Checkmated if You Don’t Up Your Skills</h2>

<p>In 1997, a computer called Deep Blue (by IBM, no less) beat Garry Kasparov<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kasparov, Garry" data-type="indexterm" id="id840"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Deep Blue" data-type="indexterm" id="id841"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="IBM" data-secondary="Deep Blue" data-type="indexterm" id="id842"/> (perhaps one of the most famous chess grandmasters ever) in chess<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="chess, AI impact on" data-type="indexterm" id="id843"/>. This was the start of the famous machine-versus-humankind matches.</p>

<p>Kasparov noted how he felt he could have beaten Deep Blue had he also had instant access to a massive corpus of chess moves too (there is speculation that the move Deep Blue played to start the winning finale was a bug, an accident, no less, but that’s outside the scope of this book). While many portrayed his comments as sour grapes, if you understand AI, you understand his point. After all, AI learns from <span class="keep-together">observations...</span>and it learns best from labeled ones. He reasoned that if an AI having access to an on-demand corpus of labeled chess moves and their outcomes during a match was fair for AI (it’s baked into the AI’s data representations), why not for a human?</p>

<p>From Kasparov’s comments (and efforts), a new class of chess, ultimately referred to as centaur chess (a variant is freestyle chess), was born. Centaur chess is like the mixed martial arts of chess (except without the leglocks, but you can still tap out). In centaur chess, participants can play on their own (human alone), entrants can be an AI (like a university building an AI to play chess on its own), or mixed (human augmented with machine).</p>

<p>How are things going? Most often, humans augmented by AI win. It’s not a wipeout though. Machines on their own do their fair share of winning too. You know who never wins? Humans on their own.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch06.html#id844" id="id844-marker">3</a></sup> This means that centaur chess is about amplifying human performance!</p>

<p class="fix_tracking">In his book, <a href="https://oreil.ly/7PFYj"><em>The Chess Master and the Computer</em></a>, Kasparov notes “Weak human plus machine plus a better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human with an inferior <span class="keep-together">process</span>.”</p>

<p>But there’s still a twist: the advent of AI didn’t kill chess at all. In fact, more people today play chess than ever before. And sure, their interest is higher than ever; and of course, Netflix even made a mini-series, <em>The Queen’s Gambit</em>. You know what else? There are more than double the chess grandmasters today than there were during Kasparov’s stare-down with technology. And many kids are, you guessed it, using AI as a coach to help them improve their own chess skills.</p>

<p>So, more skills and more interest. It seems to us that if AI can help people become better chess players, it stands to reason that it can help people become better doctors, lawyers, pilots, electricians, judges, tile cutters, teachers, and more. Is this any different than the democratization of electricity where we learned to apply its benefits to all tasks in our lives? From driving cars to cooking food to making a movie; AI will be no different.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Democratized Technology: The Job Creator" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch06_democratized_technology_the_job_creator_1740182050334756">
<h2>Democratized Technology: The Job Creator</h2>

<p>So yes, there’s bound to be job displacements—remember<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="democratized technology as job creator" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_democratizedtechnologyasjobcreator67468"/>, we said <em>net</em> job creator. Think about it—do we regret the invention of the refrigerator? But that took out the ice delivery profession. The bottom line is that AI will affect the repeatable and <span class="keep-together">rules-based</span> jobs and create ones that we haven’t even thought up yet. Democratized technology is <em>always</em> going to transform society for the better.</p>

<p>One example from banking that really caught us off guard: ATMs. When ATMs first came out, we all thought there would eventually be less staff and fewer branches because you didn’t need a bank or a teller. In short, ATMs would displace bank tellers. But look at <a data-type="xref" href="#ch06_figure_3_1740182050310425">Figure 6-3</a>—that didn’t happen. Think about it. ATMs can do the rote mundane tasks: make a bill payment, move funds from one account to another, check balances, and so on. Why should a human focus be required to do those rote mundane tasks?</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch06_figure_3_1740182050310425"><img alt="A graph with a line going up  Description automatically generated" src="assets/aivc_0603.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 6-3. </span>Since the invention of ATMs, there are more bank tellers (source: James Bessen, Boston University School of Law)</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>As <a data-type="xref" href="#ch06_figure_3_1740182050310425">Figure 6-3</a> illustrates, today there are more tellers than ever before, and they are more focused on relationship banking as opposed to the rote work of the past. And since, as it turns out, ATMs made banking cheaper to operate, there are more branches than ever before too—and sure, they may have less staff, but the shifted-left tasks allow banks to better focus on more profitable and personal services like <span class="keep-together">relationship</span> banking, bequest planning, trust and securities management, financial advisory services, and more.</p>

<p class="fix_tracking">Technology also creates demand for a better way or things people didn’t think they needed. Why do so many not realize they need a better way? Probably because they didn’t realize technology could make it better, because they weren’t equipped with the knowledge to even know it was possible to do things differently. But the world found out quickly with ride-sharing (with its digital mapping of the pickup, digital payments, and fare splitting, etc.) that there was a better way, and so the taxi industry evolved.</p>

<p>How did that happen? If you think about it, the technology that was available to these disruptors is the same technology that was available to the incumbents because most of it was open source. Truth be told, this technology was available to anyone. After all, lots of people had smartphones at the time, digital payments were a thing, and GPS was ubiquitous because everyone got directions and weather from their smartphones. Companies like Uber put those things together with a new shifted-right business model, but they operated in a different way. Instead of waiting for a taxi to drive by and hailing a cab, or making a phone call to a dispatcher, they asked, “What if we allowed people to summon a driver from their smartphone with full transparency as to expected wait times, driver details, car, and more?” Do not overlook this moment. Uber came up with a different business model, and people loved it. It wasn’t so much the technology at all, and (again) that technology was sitting around for anyone (here it comes) to put to use to stop walking by problems they could solve or make better with technology every day. Uber just happened to do it first. How? Uber used Osmon’s equation and multiplied knowledge (skills) and effort and turned that into success. What’s more, Uber’s take on the gig economy has since grown from ride-sharing to a model for home delivery of almost anything. So, like we said, we don’t think AI will replace all jobs—but it’s certain AI will change the nature of everyone’s work.</p>

<p>Finally, we also thought it helpful to share with you that we thoroughly enjoyed reading Andrew McAfee’s <em>The Geek Way</em> (Little, Brown) because it literally distills the recipe for how Uber and other digital disruptors did it. And sure, there are other critical things like culture and process that came into play, but for sure skills stand out<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_skillingandAIasjobdestroyerversuscreator66042" data-type="indexterm" id="id845"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_democratizedtechnologyasjobcreator67468" data-type="indexterm" id="id846"/>.</p>

<h1>Levers of Clever: Unlocking a Skills Program <span class="keep-together">That Lasts Forever</span></h1>

<p>In this section<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="levers of clever for skills program" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_leversofcleverforskillsprogram68827"/>, we’re going to share with you some stories, ideas, and the things we did to tip the skills balance in our favor at IBM. And while nothing lasts forever, the strategies we share in this section are solid and have been proven to work across a number of years, across hundreds of thousands of employees and partners.</p>

<p>We’re sure you’ve noticed that while written by IBMers, this book has not specifically been about IBM or its technology. We did that on purpose. But this section will reference IBM a lot and the things we’ve done around skills. This chapter was cowritten with a guest author (Rebecca Reyes), an industry-recognized thought leader around skills who led perhaps the largest upskilling efforts in our company’s storied history. This is why we’re confident in the strategies presented in this chapter—we’ve seen what works and what doesn’t and learned how to adapt. Apply our learnings to your own efforts and grow from there.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>Stress and adaptation<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="adaptability" data-secondary="transition to work with AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id847"/> are the secret keys to growth. Of course, stress on a muscle is pretty different from the way we talk about stress at work. But the point is the same—tension teaches, and it is a catalyst for anything to react and grow. Repetition rebuilds and turns tiny flaws into features.</p>

<p>Consider that “weightlifting’s most tangible effect is muscle <span class="keep-together">growth—also</span> known as hypertrophy. But what’s the mechanism driving this change? It all starts when you lift a weight heavy enough to challenge your muscles. This action causes microscopic tears in the muscle fibers. These micro-injuries trigger a biological reaction where the body initiates repair. These scientific processes build muscle during weightlifting by creating newer, stronger muscle fibers to replace the damaged ones, resulting in muscle growth over time.”<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch06.html#id848" id="id848-marker">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest tip we can give you when it comes to skills building is that skills training is like training the muscles you work on at the gym: they are developed under constant good tension, with lifting and holding. And just like a fitness plan, you first need to commit and then back that commitment with a purposeful, proven program—only this time around with skills. Are you or your team challenging your knowledge? Are you practicing regularly—finding little flaws in your skills, your scope, your story, your code, your logic—and then allowing time to repair, to learn, to adapt? Are you applying the right amount of tension (too much isn’t good for the body or your skills plan) to grow?</p>
</div>

<p class="pagebreak-before">We organized the sections in this chapter around levers you can pull to upskill your company and take advantage of this moment. You’ll find that this chapter doesn’t need to be read linearly...if you feel you’ve got one lever mastered, perhaps focus on the ones you’ve not thought about. By the time you’re done working through this chapter, you’ll have several areas you can look at and optimize for the upskilling opportunity that lies ahead.</p>

<p>Here are our skill levers:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Start at the beginning—hire the employees who want to know the “why.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Recruit digitally minded talent.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Take count—inventory your skills.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Plan for everyone—a plan without action is a speech.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Embrace the learning (and forgetting) curves.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Combine instruction, imitation, and collaboration.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Culture matters—be a skills verb, not a noun.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Set the organizational tone for AI.</p>

<h2>Lever 1: Start at the Beginning—Hire Employees Who Want to <span class="keep-together">Know the “Why”</span></h2>

<p>An early proverb<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="levers of clever for skills program" data-secondary="Lever 1: hiring for curiosity" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_leversofcleverforskillsprogramLever1hiringforcuriosity612530"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hiring for curiosity" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_hiringforcuriosity612530"/>, “Curiosity killed the cat,” warns of the risks of instigation and boundless discovery. Yet in today’s age of democratized access to information and technology, curiosity <em>thrills </em>the cat. So, while this chapter will get into some corporate programs and ideas to help upskill your business, never overlook the most important ingredient: <em>the innate curiosity in the people you hire</em>. You name the persona; we’ve managed them or seen them all. We’ve worked with people who are talented in a way no one can practice or rehearse. Others that are so curious that if something doesn’t make sense to them, they are off on the internet looking for answers and getting lost in some course. On the other end of the spectrum are those who look at assigned learning and come back to declare, “This isn’t my job; why should I take it?” or “I’m not in sales; why should I learn how our company sells our product? I just code,” and all the parts in between. You will <em>never go wrong hiring people who are naturally curious</em>. Quite simply, if tech years are like dog years (or age even faster like AI’s mouse years), then all the educational head start that formally educated staff had will fade away as time marches on.</p>

<section class="pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="Be a Mozart of learning" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch06_be_a_mozart_of_learning_1740182050334994">
<h3 class="less_space">Be a Mozart of learning</h3>

<p>There’s a story<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_MozartWolfgangAmadeus612831"/> (there are varying accounts and versions of it) about the famous composer Wolfgang Mozart who was recognized as a musical genius by the age of six. Mozart had not only created his first composition<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch06.html#id849" id="id849-marker">5</a></sup> (at age five) but had performed in front of two royal courts. One day, an aspiring composer in his twenties came to Mozart and said to him something along the lines of, “I want to compose symphonies; can you teach me?” Mozart looked at him and said, “You can’t learn how to compose symphonies; you’re not old enough.” The man remarked about being in his twenties and how Mozart was just 10 when he composed his first symphony.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch06.html#id850" id="id850-marker">6</a></sup> Mozart (known as much for being direct as he was for his music) replied, “Yes, but I wasn’t walking around asking people how to do it.”</p>

<p>What’s the point? The essence of Mozart’s reply lies in the idea that while guidance (learning plans) and learning from others are important, true mastery and capability come from within. As leaders, you must find a way to move your staff beyond seeking instructions to seeking their own knowledge experiments. Remember, your organization will need a mix of prescriptive journeys, but perhaps even more, forums that spotlight and encourage that natural resource of curiosity.</p>

<p>To really put curiosity at the core of the hiring process, ensure you work with your HR team’s talent acquisition teams so that they closely monitor for curiosity attributes during the hiring process. You’re going to get recruiters who don’t know what GitHub is; they need to get upskilled so they know how to look beyond a CV or LinkedIn page because a candidate’s GitHub is often a curiosity calling card. And look beyond the skills your business needs. For example, one candidate stood out to us because not only was she technically curious and accomplished, but she also had a thriving social media account (@culinarychum) where she focused on restaurants that do a great job accommodating allergies (like celiac disease) and great gluten-free products at grocery stores. This is a real IBMer (Elena Márquez<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Márquez, Elena" data-type="indexterm" id="id851"/>) and she’s showcasing all kinds of skills we love (in addition to her super deep technical skills): social network (active, with a personal point of view—bonus points for more than just business; this is a great way to see how any applicant applies curiosity to their world), compassion, community, writing, engagement, and more. Again, collectively we’ve overseen tens of thousands (even a hundred thousand, considering the job of one of the authors) of employees, across all domains, across billions of dollars of investment. Do you know what always separates spinners and winners? Curiosity! <em>In today’s economy, jobs require skills, not (just) degrees.</em></p>
<!--last sentence above is former pull quote -->

<p class="pagebreak-before">Obviously, not all employees are new to a business. You’ll need to empower your management team to assess and observe curiosity and enable self-driven skills training<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="self-driven skills training" data-type="indexterm" id="id852"/>. Create time to empower and invest in those employees. They will tell you the how: from external training, conferences, community volunteer work—your job is to help them connect the dots to a growth path aligned to your business. That conference they want to attend—are they a speaker? As a manager or mentor, offer to review their speaker submission forms or be a safe space to preview their pitch—your encouragement, even your simple suggestions, may be the difference maker that turns someone from a curious observer to a confident, passionate leader. For example, at IBM we have programs where managers can use their budgets to pay for third-party training—from an MBA to a security certificate to presenting skills and all parts in between. And if external training isn’t in your budget, perhaps a flexible work schedule would enable your employee to make their own investment in the cost of the training, knowing that you value them and are investing in them in other ways (like paid time to learn).</p>

<p>Why all the fuss about curiosity? Because empowered curious employees will find what they need or come to you for help to get it. And curious employees are leading indicators in your upskilling adoption curve—if you can isolate the best upskilling investments made by your curious front-runners, you can more quickly scale that upskilling throughout your organization and pull new skills through to your majority workforce. It’s the ultimate bespoke training model—one that even AI can’t <span class="keep-together">outperform</span><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_leversofcleverforskillsprogramLever1hiringforcuriosity612530" data-type="indexterm" id="id853"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_hiringforcuriosity612530" data-type="indexterm" id="id854"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Lever 2: Recruit Digitally Minded Talent" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch06_lever_2_recruit_digitally_minded_talent_1740182050335112">
<h2>Lever 2: Recruit Digitally Minded Talent</h2>

<p>Since we already noted how AI skill<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="levers of clever for skills program" data-secondary="Lever 2: recruiting digitally minded talent" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_leversofcleverforskillsprogramLever2recruitingdigitallymindedtalent614649"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="recruiting digitally minded talent" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_recruitingdigitallymindedtalent614649"/> years age much faster than human years, it’s apparent that even when you hire the best skilled people, you’ll need to keep investing in them. For this reason, we think it’s important you recruit digitally minded talent from the get-go. But we want to be clear, this doesn’t mean talent needs to have a computer science degree: it means you look for people who can demonstrate how they constantly embrace innovations that make stuff better, go faster, be more accurate, are more streamlined, and more.</p>

<p>You probably already know what non-digitally minded talent looks like. They’re the people who openly say, “I’m not technical”; they likely click on File <math alttext="right-arrow">
  <mo>→</mo>
</math> Copy then <span class="keep-together">File <math alttext="right-arrow">
  <mo>→</mo>
</math> Paste</span> (over and over again) versus eloquently pressing Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V; they present dashboard reports with copied images in PowerPoint that are a week out of date; and the biggest tell are those people with $1,500 iPhones who leave 90% of their capabilities untouched (and unknown)—like using AI to grab text from a photo. This really matters, so don’t overlook it. Because if someone is digitally minded, they will always independently seek out more efficient ways to do things like using agents to get more work done.</p>

<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>
<p>Pro tip: Many companies<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="academic credentials, broadening recruiting scope" data-type="indexterm" id="id855"/> have their preferred recruiting schools—kind of like the law firm that only takes Harvard graduates. Toss that playbook right out the window. There is no question that some schools are harder to get into than others, and they have more resources, but the truth is the battleground for talent is vast. You’d be shocked at the talent that lies “beneath” the veneer of Ivy League or big-name schools. Community colleges have loads of amazing talent that we’ve recruited from and watched their careers flourish. Veterans often make great transitions from deployment to employment and bring with them a wealth of real-world experience and disciplined focus. Just go find the talent!</p>
</div>

<p>When posting your job ads, get creative about defining skill requirements and job roles. Do you really have a requirement for a four-year degree or is that just a default motion on the talent acquisition form? If we only valued those with a specific higher degree, the world would have missed out on people like Steve Jobs (cofounder of Apple), Amancio Ortega (founder of Inditex, the world’s largest fashion retailer), and Anna Wintour (<em>Vogue</em> editor-in-chief). Don’t misinterpret what we’re saying here, degrees are helpful indicators and provide an invaluable mental model for learning acquisition and knowledge transference, but they aren’t the only factor...not by a long shot.</p>

<p>The Harvard Business School’s “Hidden Workers: Untapped Talent” study<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch06.html#id856" id="id856-marker">7</a></sup> noted that, “A large majority (88%) of employers agree, telling us that <em>qualified high skills candidates</em> are vetted out of the process because they do not match the exact criteria established by the job description.” Look, if you need a programmer, you want to know they’ve written enterprise-worthy code before, but <em>never </em>underestimate the power of gratitude and effort. The bottom line is that today’s hiring process workflow all too often seems to focus on a résumé or missing experience rather than what someone can bring to a role. Don’t fall into that trap. Foster a dynamic way of working, promote growth opportunities, and get away from that long list of requirements that exclude so many from getting the job, let alone applying for it.</p>

<p>You’ll also want to carefully consider using an AI-driven tool to surface candidate skills and employee profiles for adopting a skills-based hiring strategy. As we covered in the last chapter, when wielded bluntly, AI-based recruitment tools can do more harm than good. But, when carefully managed and safeguarded against bias, they can be used to establish an opportunity marketplace to support internal career mobility opportunities—by definition, when human capital rotates into new roles, they learn new things. When is the right time to move roles? While some executives like to put timelines on a role (like move jobs every 2–3 years), we think that if you show up to work every day and you’re not scared of anything, then you likely aren’t learning anything either, and that’s likely a good time to do something new. Quite simply, growth and comfort cannot coexist. So, tenure in a job doesn’t have to relate to skills, but getting uncomfortable is directly related to skills growth<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_leversofcleverforskillsprogramLever2recruitingdigitallymindedtalent614649" data-type="indexterm" id="id857"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_recruitingdigitallymindedtalent614649" data-type="indexterm" id="id858"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Lever 3: Take Count—Inventory Your Skills" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch06_lever_3_take_count_inventory_your_skills_1740182050335172">
<h2>Lever 3: Take Count—Inventory Your Skills</h2>

<p>Earlier in this chapter, we noted a BCG report that cited that all but a handful of companies can forecast skill gaps. Imagine trying to forecast the weather without temperature, wind speed, air pressure, and more. And yet the majority of companies are operating without a skills baseline, gap analysis, and strategic road map corresponding to their future growth plans.</p>

<p>For inventory, start with specific technical skills with measures (levels) that crisply articulate what an employee is capable of doing. Inventorying anything starts with a taxonomy and a count metric. AI can help <em>infer</em> skills too, but<em> </em>we really want to issue a cautionary warning here: there is a lot of snake oil AI in this domain. It’s not an issue if AI is “guessing” what someone’s skill might be, but we think it needs to be verified by a human (human-in-the-loop). After all, if a human agrees with an AI assessment, you’ve just created a labeled data pair, which as we noted earlier is critical to steering a model.</p>

<p>There are some that feel AI skill assessments<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="skill assessments" data-type="indexterm" id="id859"/> can handle it all, shifting-left that task for a manager because they are so busy. But what are they busy doing? Isn’t managing people part of a manager’s job? If the average manager manages 15 people, is it too much to ask a manger to meet with their employees...and make skills conversations an ever-present component in every interaction? Why not use the AI to probe into weak areas and ask their employees if they agree? Sometimes the AI will be bang on, and sometimes it won’t. Here’s some free insight into the most senior levels of a corporation: if someone is talking about it, they are somewhat interested—if they measure it, they are committed, and then it matters. For this reason alone, managers should be having frequent skills conversations with their employees. And while you are busy getting your staff upskilled on AI, it’s important to focus on non-STEM content too—interpersonal and intrapersonal skills<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="soft skills, importance of" data-type="indexterm" id="id860"/>, often referred to as <em>soft skills</em>—which are important but much tougher to measure.</p>

<p>We think the best way to ensure skills veracity is to have a central inventory taxonomy that automatically updates on a range (for example, Level 1 to Level 5) upon completion of a course or an activity (like a pilot or a successfully rated practice pitch to your coach). At IBM, we defined a five-level skills inventorying system for our technical sales teams, and it looks like <a data-type="xref" href="#ch06_figure_4_1740182050310448">Figure 6-4</a>.</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch06_figure_4_1740182050310448"><img alt="A blue and white text on a white background  Description automatically generated" src="assets/aivc_0604.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 6-4. </span>A crisp and concise framework for skills with increasing levels of auditability</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>There are some obvious design patterns to this framework, and some nuanced ones too. Here were our design points:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Hard skills need a hardened assessment</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>We love self-reflection<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hard skills, assessment tips" data-type="indexterm" id="id861"/>, but in this space, we don’t think self-assessment surveys work (but that said, highly qualified candidates should be able to test out). They are kind of like asking your cat to rate its own hunting skills—she’s the queen of the jungle until the laser pointer comes out.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Tech sales and sales both need sales acumen and technical prowess</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>For this reason, Level 1 and Level 2 are common for <em>both </em>technical sales<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sales skills assessment" data-type="indexterm" id="id862"/> and traditional sales personnel because they educate about the market and our value drivers. Level 3 is the “show, don’t tell” level. Here we start a bifurcation—a seller is expected to do a live scripted demo, whereas a technical seller is expected to go way off script (at the behest of the client), explain things deeply, and customize that live demo to a certain degree. And make no mistake about it, we’ve got some super technical people, and some of them hate Level 1 and Level 2. Perfect! It likely means they’re growing their business value skills. Some sellers feel that Level 3 is too deep and scary because it’s live and not a press play video. Perfect! Since those demos are built with a “can’t fail if you follow the instructions” guide, we’ll presume we are making those sellers more technical. To verify the veracity of our can’t fail claims, at times we get middle school students to finish a Level 3. This also makes for a great retort when some of our sellers come up with the “too technical” comment as the reason why they didn’t do the work. The truth of the matter is, they were missing the effort.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Achieving higher skill levels comes with demonstrability requirements and auditability of those achievements</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>As you get to higher authenticated skill levels<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="demonstrability requirements for skills" data-type="indexterm" id="id863"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="auditability" data-secondary="skills" data-type="indexterm" id="id864"/>, the veracity of those skill declarations becomes more and more of something you could place a Las Vegas bet on (more on this in a bit). It’s not something you, or even your manager, can simply assert, or simply attend a lecture and claim mastery. In fact, it’s quite the opposite: if Level 1 + Level 2 = Know, then Level 3 = Show, and Level 4 = Do, and Level 5 = Teach. Level 3 and 4 skills include a healthy dose of hands-on work and a witness. In this way, skill level ascension leaves behind an audit trail—something for the learner and the enterprise to hold up as evidence of achievement. This could be used to charge different rates (as higher-skilled consultants often bill at a different rate than junior associates) or to pay for performance in different employee pools (higher-skilled employees can and should demand higher-wage positions). It can also be used to forecast your future hiring needs based on the skills your clients are likely to demand versus what internally your company is equipped to deliver. Our advice: resist the temptation to rush these in pursuit of a headline (“We have 100 senior AI developers standing by!”); instead, treasure them as a milestone well earned, and ensure the path is appropriately challenging and rewarding in its pursuits—if you do, the complaints on the difficulty are well worth it when you see the accolades from those who’ve met the mark. And remember, if you make it a high bar, it will command respect. But if you let other parts of the company seep in low bar accomplishments to increment skill levels (like because you attended a webinar you got a skill increment), you’ll end up diluting the program.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Map our levels to verbs (actions) to show that we expect the person who attained that skill to be able to do or know</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Notice in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch06_figure_4_1740182050310448">Figure 6-4</a> that under the levels are a set of verbs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="verbs, mapping skill levels to" data-type="indexterm" id="id865"/>. Using verbs, we know that if we have a tech seller in Japan who is a Level 4, they can go to a client and perform a pilot or deploy a platform. At IBM, this means you’re pretty deep: you know how to deploy software; pilot or benchmark that software; and you understand Day 0, Day 1, and Day 2 tasks, and more. But it also gives us a common skill language. Little did we know at the time, but the value of these verbs quickly revealed itself as a way to get supreme clarity and ease communications among clients, partners, and IBMers with respect to an individual’s capabilities. Now, we’re working on building this out for soft skills like communication and value conveyance.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Built in conjunction with HR</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>We think one of the reasons companies aren’t doing as well as they should in the skills department is that they think it’s solely an HR job. But that can’t be the case if you want to really do well in this area. It has to be a partnership with domain experts. Indeed, HR is focusing on learning and knowledge (L&amp;K), and tying into the corporate framework is critical. The framework we built for technical sales was purpose-built to plug into the IBM HR framework. Why? What if you ran development? Then you might want some different verbs. This reminds us of a quote from David Packard of Hewlett-Packard (HP) fame, “Marketing is too important to [just] be left to the marketing department.” We softened the quote with the word “just” to capture the point we are trying to make</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Everything has an expiry date</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>We have granular controls over this, but we realize what you learned today might have to change over time. Our badges expire yearly, and we can have some of them auto-renew because not much has changed, we might give you some new delta lessons added to a plan for you to complete to keep your credential (or you will lose it), or expire it and reassign it because so much of the content has changed.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Bevel your levels" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch06_bevel_your_levels_1740182050335232">
<h3>Bevel your levels</h3>

<p>As previously mentioned<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="levers of clever for skills program" data-secondary="Lever 3: taking count-inventory of skills" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_leversofcleverforskillsprogramLever3takingcountinventoryofskills619939"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="count-inventory of skills" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_countinventoryofskills619939"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="inventory of skills" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_inventoryofskills619939"/>, <a data-type="xref" href="#ch06_figure_4_1740182050310448">Figure 6-4</a> shows different levels that correlate to verbs for our technical seller and traditional seller skills at IBM. We thought it’d be useful to further flesh out these levels, so you better understand the precision of the IBM Technology skills framework and can apply that to your own skills programs.</p>

<p>Level 1 and Level 2 are the basics of the when and why. These levels are about value and our go-to market. Level 1 starts with <em>framing </em>the business problem our clients are facing today, as well as what’s on the horizon. We don’t want technology projects; we want shift left and shift right business value projects. At this level, the learner is focused on how to highlight their client’s pain points (not asking...they already know them) and perhaps introduce them to ones they don’t know they have (or are going to have—like explainable AI). This is where the learner works through things like creating that aha moment, or the client remarks, “Gee...I never thought of it this way before” (this stuff is pure gold with clients because it means the seller is teaching, not pushing part numbers). Learners progress through these levels by writing some open book tests (kind of like a Coursera course). We want to ensure that learners have gone through the material and know where to come back when they hit the forgetting curves (more on this in a bit). In these levels, we’re sure that some sellers “cheat” themselves and just search for the answers (just like they could do in a Coursera course). We’re good with that. Why? At some point, they’re going to be live in front of a client and will be in a panic. They will scramble to learn and appreciate the learning then—and perhaps bring a different point of view the next time. And, quite honestly, to be good at something, often you have to be bad at it first and learn through the pain. Of course, if you’re an expert, you can skip the lesson, but still benefit from the client facing materials that are within and just test it out. We’re confident these levels help our sellers sell. How so? Remember those Golden Circler stats? (Not to mention we use these materials ourselves.)</p>

<p>In Level 3, a seller is giving a live demo, articulating the value drivers they learned in Level 1 and Level 2 and now showing (not telling) the technology. In other words, there are no PowerPoint slides or marketing collateral here: you’re multishot prompting a model or generating synthetic data...with value explanation. Level 3 gets a manager sign-off—that means if anyone is “cheating” the system, now the manager and employee have to be in on it.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>The word “demo” gets thrown around a lot<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="demos, refining the definition" data-type="indexterm" id="id866"/>, but we want to stand firm on something and hope you will follow: a demo means showing something live. We’ve had (heated) discussions with sales leaders who swear that explaining a video is the same as doing a demo. It’s not. Customers can smell that from a mile away. Now, having a backup video in case the internet betrays you? Smart move. But leading with a video? No. Just imagine: a seller walks in, raving about their “accessible and easy-to-use no-code platform that brings GenAI to everyone,” and instead of actually showing it, they hit Play on a video. Nothing screams “accessible and easy to use” like...not using it at all.</p>
</div>

<p>As you move into Level 4, you’re doing some heavy-duty technical sales stuff...the stuff most techies love to do. If PowerPoint tells and demos sell, then deployment <em>gels</em>. These levels are loved by those nerds that swear up and down that vi (the ubiquitous Unix text editor) is a productivity tool and CAPTCHA was a good idea. As previously mentioned, you’re doing Day 0, Day 1, and Day 2 tasks for a client, typically on their machines or cloud properties. So how does auditability increase here? Well, the client engagement is managed in our sales cadence process and our management system (for example, was the pilot successful? Are they up and running? and so on). Now, if a tech seller, manager (who signs off on the work in the IBM sales systems), and the client (who implies the work was done by buying and not complaining that the work wasn’t done right) were in on it...then you could “cheat” your way to Level 4. Level 4 is a combination of hands-on and hands-off learning. Cheaters at Level 4 don’t last long.</p>

<p>Finally, Level 5 describes the amazing people (the real rock stars) that Workday rightfully roasted in their Super Bowl LVII ad<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch06.html#id867" id="id867-marker">8</a></sup>...these are people everybody gets to know. Why? They are book authors and bloggers; they are the ones teaching their peers, the ones that clients request by name or will write references for, the go-to people when the toughest of problems are presented. We aren’t fans of “board approvals,” but for Level 5, it could make sense. These are the pinnacle of skills, and the rigor is in the obviousness of the skills level. How do you cheat this level? Perhaps getting your parents and friends to anonymously like your articles or podcasts? Not sure...but it’s a pretty solid bet that if you meet people like this at IBM, you can Google them, and you will see just why they are a sought-after talented bunch.</p>

<p>Take a moment to think about the skill depth required for your team. Build a quick list of five levels with verbs that demonstrate a more refined level of understanding and outcome delivered by each. Does your HR department already codify skill levels? If so, do those verbs align with your needs? Your skills may correspond to specific products or offerings, or they could be more generic behaviors required within a job family.</p>

<p>Now, think specifically about the skills required for AI—whether it’s adoption, experimentation, build, or otherwise. What skill families are most important for the opportunities facing your company or organization?</p>

<p>And remember, there is no unified, globally accepted taxonomy for skills—but whatever you define should be highly calibrated to, and measurable by, your organization<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_leversofcleverforskillsprogramLever3takingcountinventoryofskills619939" data-type="indexterm" id="id868"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_countinventoryofskills619939" data-type="indexterm" id="id869"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_inventoryofskills619939" data-type="indexterm" id="id870"/>.</p>

<h2>Lever 4: Plan for Everyone—A Plan Without Action Is a Speech</h2>

<p>With your inventory established<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="levers of clever for skills program" data-secondary="Lever 4: planning for action" data-type="indexterm" id="id871"/>, now you turn to a skills plan. Where do you need to make investments and where should you prune?</p>

<p>At IBM, we’ve been massively upskilling all our employees on GenAI and agents. This means intentionally looking at critical roles we expect to act as growth drivers for the company, ensuring that we are bringing in new talent that has those skills, all the while directing the development of our workforce to develop those skills in parallel.</p>

<p>We started by convening the executive leaders responsible for those roles, working with them to establish their growth needs versus the current state (lead in the front—more on that to come). If you take a snapshot of your current employees’ skills inventory and set the end state of where you want to be by year end, what then becomes the journey in the middle? We established a system that was a mix of assigned and choose-your-own adventure learning. You need to establish a quarterly rhythm of learning assignments with clear deadlines, progress markers, and celebrations of progression (this is another sleeper benefit...what people—especially in sales—won’t do to win a competition). We customized all of this by job role...after all, what you expect of a senior AI architect with 20 years’ experience should be different than that of someone in their first professional role sitting in a digital sales job (though they should both have the same answer to “What is GenAI anyway?”—like we said, Level 1 is for everyone!).</p>

<p>With expectations set and managers equipped to both lead from the front and share the progression of the team, we turn to the big finale: creating a movement.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Some things to consider as you build your plan:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>What is the from-to story you or your enterprise needs to tell?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The best plans spread key actions out over time. Of all the things you need to do, what is mission critical and immediate? What can be done in a longer timeframe?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Who are the executive sponsors of this upskilling investment? (They <em>must</em> <span class="keep-together">participate—we</span> will talk about those execs who talk about it and don’t do it later in this chapter.)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>How will you ensure that your managers and leaders are committed to upskilling themselves and prioritizing the time for your employees to upskill?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>How is learning assigned? Who is coaching or cadencing the milestones? Who is selecting the assignments?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>How will you recognize (and possibly reward) your employees for completing learning?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Does the work of learning contribute to your skills inventory?</p>
	</li>

<h2>Lever 5: Embrace the Learning (and Forgetting) Curves</h2>

<p>Beyond the short life of tech skills<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="levers of clever for skills program" data-secondary="Lever 5: embracing learning curves" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_leversofcleverforskillsprogramLever5embracinglearningcurves624550"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="learning curves, embracing" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_learningcurvesembracing624550"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="forgetting curves, embracing" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_forgettingcurvesembracing624550"/> analogies we’ve been referring to throughout this book, there is something else you have to appreciate when it comes to skills: <em>the forgetting curve</em>. Whether it’s human nature, the overload of new information coming to us, or the apparent destruction of the human attention span over the last decades (one report has it lower than a goldfish at eight seconds), we are all going to forget many of the things we learn. One of the biggest challenges when training large models is that GPUs don’t hold a lot of memory. When they run out, they have to offload data into CPU caches, and when that runs out, it goes to system memory and then to disk...every offload significantly impacts performance. Your brain is no different (except you don’t get yearly capacity upgrades), and that is why retrieval of information you can’t quite remember, but you know you saw somewhere, is critical for employee clock speed (especially in sales).</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch06_figure_5_1740182050310468">Figure 6-5</a> shows the roller coaster that is the <em>learning curve</em>. Embrace every wild twist and turn of it, because roller coasters are more fun than straight lines. We’ve seen so many not appreciate this curve across our many years of experience—a failure to take note of the varying slopes, descents, and ascents on the curve.</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch06_figure_5_1740182050310468"><img alt="A diagram of a curve  Description automatically generated" src="assets/aivc_0605.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 6-5. </span>Embrace the learning curve</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>And just like everyone knows how a roller coaster typically starts (with a slow ascent), every organization knows the initial part of the learning curve: this is optional or assigned education to teach employees something. There are all kinds of learners here; we’ve seen them all. But! No matter who you are, after a week of long conferences, or hours of learning through the year, everyone forgets stuff. This is the part of the roller coaster (called <em>the drop</em>) where gravity takes over and that stomach-lurching plunge sets in. For learners, we call this the <em>forgetting curve</em>. And just like a roller coaster, one of two things is going to happen when entering the learning drop: they might throw their hands up in excitement and embrace it (there is an action plan—the scramble learning part of the curve) or up comes your pretzel and questionably flavored slushy (which is to say the learning was lost, only not in a gross way). The bottom line is, if you’re in charge of skills and forget to equip your team to ride out the forgetting curve, it doesn’t end well for you or your company.</p>

<p>Leslie Valiant<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Valiant, Leslie" data-type="indexterm" id="id872"/> notes that “a critical feature of education is that it can impart knowledge that will be useful later, in ways not foreseen at the time of the imparting.” We call<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="scramble learning" data-type="indexterm" id="id873"/> this the <em>scramble learning</em> part of the learning curve—and this is where high-quality content producers become heroes. This is where your sellers need to jump back to some past learning to get the pieces they need, and parts they will inevitably forget (but do it in a mad dash to prep for a client meeting or call). Look, you might know how GenAI can be prompted for better results, but you may need a brush-up on the difference between using fine-tuning or a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) adapter to better fine-tune your LLM for the task at hand. Perhaps you just need a refresher on the definition of DevSecOps. We find that sellers have loads of love to give during the scramble learning phase as opposed to the event and course portion where you get some love, but you’ll get your share of moans and groans for any assigned learning too.</p>

<p>We bring this up because you need to make your learning modular and easy to jump back into for key parts that are needed in the scramble. And you also need to teach learners how to be a part of their own rescue—to know where to find the cheat codes in the learning and refresh themselves with just enough, at just the right time. Metadata helps here, too. If the learning is delivered by subject matter experts (SMEs), <span class="keep-together">capture</span> the syllabus, notes, and key takeaways so learning assets can be centrally accessed at a later time. Teach the learner how and where to find these—laying down the breadcrumbs to help with the scramble inevitably results in gratefulness.</p>

<p>If the learning you’re giving employees is video only, you need to have a transcript, modularize videos into chapters, and put some GenAI over it so learners can jump to parts they need to remember by asking for it. For example, if a learner wanted to get back up to speed on prompting techniques, an LLM could generate links to those locations. Even better: the LLM assembles a 30-second summary on the request for all the coverage areas in the 3-hour GenAI class, with a hot-linked table of contents to portions of the video that are stitched together—think of it as a prompt-tuning highlight reel. Now turn this up another notch and let AI index and generate a turn conversation with a seller posing as a client. After about four or five questions (such as “Explain to me the value of putting my data into a model, but also the risks”), it returns a report card across key measures (quality of answer, use of jargon, and so on). It’s a great way for nervous sellers to gain confidence in the privacy of a no-judgment zone. Perhaps use the AI to make a podcast of the material like what Google’s NotebookLM can do. There are lots of ideas here (agents take it to another level), and they will all catch the attention of your learners because they are different, engaging, and provide clock speed.</p>

<p>This isn’t the future. IBM’s watsonx platform literally generates fan-requested highlight reels for golf’s biggest stage (the Masters Tournament) along with auto-generated commentary that maps your favorite player’s fist- and chest-bumps, birdies, bogies, and pulls that leave ’em in the rough with no ifs, ands, or putts about it. For real! Name the player, and AI will take a round (which typically lasts just over four hours—it used to anyway) and create a three-minute video that distills it down to what you want (a player’s highlights in this case).<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_leversofcleverforskillsprogramLever5embracinglearningcurves624550" data-type="indexterm" id="id874"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_learningcurvesembracing624550" data-type="indexterm" id="id875"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_forgettingcurvesembracing624550" data-type="indexterm" id="id876"/></p>

<h2>Lever 6: Combine Instruction + Imitation + Collaboration</h2>

<p>Leslie Valiant was awarded the Turing Award in 2010 for his foundational contributions<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="levers of clever for skills program" data-secondary="Lever 6: instruction, imitation, collaboration" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_leversofcleverforskillsprogramLever6instructionimitationcollaboration6263100"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="learning considerations in skilling" data-secondary="instruction, imitation, collaboration combination" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_learningconsiderationsinskillinginstructionimitationcollaborationcombination6263100"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="skilling" data-secondary="learning considerations" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_skillinglearningconsiderations6263100"/> to machine learning and computer science. Yet at the time of writing, his most recent book is not about computers at all, at least not the 1s and 0s. <em>The Importance of Being Educable</em> (Princeton University Press) argues that understanding the nature of our own educability is crucial to safeguarding our future. After breaking down how we process information to learn and apply knowledge and drawing comparisons with other animals and AI systems, Valiant explains why education should be humankind’s central preoccupation. If we want to play to our species’ great strength and protect our collective future, we must better understand and prioritize the vital importance of being educable.<em> </em></p>

<p>Valiant goes on to make a case for the extraordinary facility of humans to absorb and apply knowledge and that the remarkable “educability” of the human brain can be understood as an information-processing ability. He argues that our educability is what sets our species apart, enabling what we have in our world today—this gives us the power and potential to set our planet on a steady course. (Recall the Steve Jobs quote we shared in the Preface, highly correlated points of views.) Yet he warns that it comes hand in hand with an insidious weakness: while we can readily absorb entire systems of thought about worlds of experience beyond our own, we struggle to judge correctly what information we should trust. This is one of the founding figures of AI, and he’s stressing the unique ability of our human brains to learn, to challenge what AI creates, and to create upskilling systems that consistently lift up our communities. We agree.</p>

<p>Let’s delve further. Michael Tomasello<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tomasello, Michael" data-type="indexterm" id="id877"/>, an American developmental and comparative psychologist, suggests humans learn best via a combination of imitation, instruction, and collaboration. Likely this is how your own childhood learning looked—as a child, watching those around you and mimicking their behaviors, then going to more formal learning, and eventually working with peers jointly to reach the state you are at today. This can be extracted far beyond early childhood.</p>

<p>For our sales professionals, we follow a similar model at IBM. We start them with some formal training around a platform (maybe some basic expectations on how to engage with clients), and then what follows is a period of observation where sellers learn through some medium like a ride-along, shadowing sales calls, sitting in on key meetings, and more. Learners (especially new hires) get to work with managers, peers, and AI to try out and practice ideas in a space that feels safe to them—all this results in feedback and coaching, which are critical components of the experience.</p>

<h3>Living for Gaga’s “Applause”—do it for real or don’t do it at all</h3>

<p>Let’s start by channeling some help from Hollywood<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="learning considerations in skilling" data-secondary="persistent practice (A Star Is Born example)" data-type="indexterm" id="id878"/> to ensure you at least get the two things you <em>must </em>remember if you’re leading an organization in today’s AI climate: the half-life of tech skills is like no other <em>and </em>you have to get your hands dirty.</p>

<p>It really doesn’t matter your age, almost everyone knows some version of the movie, <em>A Star Is Born</em>. This movie debuted in 1937 and new versions of it seem to show up every 20 years or so. No matter the version you remember, each of them brings the same ubiquitous story of fame, love, and tragedy—all framed around someone rising up while that someone’s dual-role of lover and mentor is on the way down. The 2018 version starring Lady Gaga (who is the one on the rise) and Bradley Cooper (the one on the way down) is the remake that catches our eyes when it comes to skills.</p>

<p>While you likely know the story, you may not know that Bradley Cooper played and sang everything you saw in the movie <em>live</em> with mega music star Lady Gaga. Why? Because <em>Lady Gaga demanded it</em> (much respect). To prepare for this movie, Cooper spent over 18 months on vocal lessons, 6 months on guitar lessons, and 6 months on piano lessons. He worked on lowering his voice and more. All in all, it took Bradley Cooper almost 3 years to get fully ready for this remake, which took just 42 days to film.</p>

<p>What’s the point? For one of the world’s best actors to master his moment and rise to the occasion, he invested years and invoked trainers on voice, guitar, piano, directing, and a number of other skills. To become something he wasn’t, he needed to believe in the end state vision and have the training and coaching available that would lead up to that realization. Said another way, if one of the world’s most successful and in-demand actors believed in what was possible enough to spend all that time working on his skills for a remake that took 42 days to film, what do you think your organization should be collectively doing around its skills posture?</p>

<h3>Build the sandbox—encourage the messy</h3>

<p>You learn by getting your hands dirty<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sandbox, building for skills program" data-type="indexterm" id="id879"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="learning considerations in skilling" data-secondary="sandbox experimentation" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_learningconsiderationsinskillingsandboxexperimentation627953"/>. If you want to upskill the many, then before any programs, inventory, and learning agendas, you have to have a place to experiment without friction, a place to practice. This means if you want to spin up some GPUs to build a traditional AI convolutional neural network (CNN) for a computer vision project, have at it. You should be able to spin up a vector database like Chroma or Milvus, play around with different encoding algorithms, and see what happens to your semantic searches. Maybe you want to connect to a database and create a schema and play around with an open table format like Iceberg and test out its isolation levels. Yes!</p>

<p>There are costs associated with that. Our advice: let curiosity be the guide. Create patterns that are the right size to learn, instead of getting lost in the countless hours and internal process of user chargebacks. You don’t need to give someone a 128-node data lakehouse to learn about how to store and prepare data for AI; they can get by with 3 nodes. Remember, these aren’t pilots or proof of concepts, they are learning mechanisms. Encourage your employees to leverage all the free trial software that’s out <span class="keep-together">there—it’s</span> a great way to learn. Hyperscalers<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hyperscalers, accessing for sandbox" data-type="indexterm" id="id880"/> offer free and lite services: Google gives away generous GPU cycles with its Colab platform, IBM has a number of lite cloud services where you can literally build out AI applications for free, and <span class="keep-together">DeepLearning.AI</span> has some great free stuff too. Now look internally. You will likely stand up some of your own training “stacks” so people can “play.” Don’t just make technology available—consider making things more engaging. For example, the University of Ottawa built its Cyber Range in partnership with IBM and Coding for Veterans (thanks to Jeff Musson), where the learning cohort starts with an actual phone call from a hacker (actor), and a learner with the persona of someone in the Security Operations Center (SOC) picks up the phone, and the drama begins. Very cool!</p>

<p>If you’re using external sites, <em>do not </em>use your data or your clients’ data, and <em>watch out</em> for the terms and conditions (feedback ones, too, which we talked about in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05_live_die_buy_or_try_much_will_be_decided_by_ai_1740182048942635">Chapter 5</a>). If you don’t have access to data, know that there are literally thousands of <span class="keep-together">datasets</span> to play around with that are specific to tasks. If you want to find some data, check out Kaggle, Data.gov, Papers With Code, and more.</p>

<p>As for the stuff that costs your business money, that’s OK too. Put safeguards around it. Application resource management (ARM) software<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="application resource management (ARM) software" data-type="indexterm" id="id881"/> like Turbonomic can identify and stop wasted resources, and using Technology Business Management (TBM) software<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Technology Business Management (TBM) software" data-type="indexterm" id="id882"/> stacks like Apptio helps you communicate costs to lines of business. At IBM, we’ve centralized much of our sandbox into a central learning and demo hub we call the IBM TechZone and have shared much about its making on <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://ibm.com"><em>ibm.com</em></a> so anyone building their own sandbox can learn from our own successes and failures—and we certainly have our fair share of both (thankfully, more of the former than the latter). If you ever have the opportunity to hear John Steiner speak at an IBM conference, don’t miss it! He’s not only an engaging speaker but also a master of cloud delivery and provisioning—we’ll let you decide whether his dry geek humor is good or not, but you’ll learn tons from him and smile at least once.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_learningconsiderationsinskillingsandboxexperimentation627953" data-type="indexterm" id="id883"/></p>

<h3>Show off (and celebrate) those digital credentials!</h3>

<p>In many countries<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="digital credentials" data-type="indexterm" id="id884"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="credentials, digital" data-type="indexterm" id="id885"/>, before a new driver is awarded their driver’s license (their credentials), they must take a certain amount of training, log a set amount of practice time, pass a written test, and successfully demonstrate basic skills to a licensed test administrator in a live field scenario. This journey, well-known and well-traveled by thousands, is often a highly anticipated but frightening rite of passage for any new driver. Similarly, F1 drivers, prospective astronauts, and fighter pilots all log significant time in highly technical and calibrated simulators. Even amateur runners training for a marathon collect streams of data on their practice runs as they work to perfect their pace. Before graduating to the big day (of earning your driver’s license, experiencing space flight for the first time, or before hearing “Go” to start a marathon), there is practice and feedback. Now it’s time to ask yourself, “Is this a part of your own professional training regimes?”</p>

<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="ch06_credentials_cred_1740182050335730">
<h1>Credentials Cred</h1>

<p>Credential trends show IBMers are investing time and energy into building skill depth, and our programming is hard at work feeding curiosity. From 2022 (the first year we released our program, which is a culmination of all the levers talked about in this chapter) to 2023, we saw a 350% year-over-year growth in credentials earned by our workforce, which require skill demonstration to earn! By the end of 2024, that number rose again! While we know there are many ways to gain skill depth, these credentials are validated representations of those deep skills: building eminence in AI, the cloud, industry, quantum, and more for employees, and bolstering IBM’s reputation at the same time when these are shared by employees on LinkedIn. In fact, in 2024, <a href="https://oreil.ly/8TIS3">IBM</a> was recognized as one of Credly’s Top 10 Issuers. We expect to issue our 1,000,000th badge in 2025. (Humble brag moment: IBM has been winning awards for this program since its inception, so this new one is a compliment—but not a surprise.) Quality matters—truly, if you build it, they will come. Of the 46,000 ratings given, almost 80% are 5 stars (out of 5 stars), and ~90% receive a 4- to 5-star rating. We believe holding a line on high-quality education matters, and we think our results prove it. In short, all of the things we talk about in this chapter are how we achieved everything you just read. You got the playbook now; go upskill the many.</p>
</div></aside>

<p>A badging program<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="badging program, for credential visibility" data-type="indexterm" id="id886"/>, whether administered internally or by a third-party agency like Credly, is critical to add authenticity and rigor to your skills investment. Again, proceed here with caution: there is a temptation to put a badge at the end of trivial journeys; this makes them trite and degrades their value. Be specific about what makes a badge and be a stickler in sticking to that policy<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_leversofcleverforskillsprogramLever6instructionimitationcollaboration6263100" data-type="indexterm" id="id887"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_learningconsiderationsinskillinginstructionimitationcollaborationcombination6263100" data-type="indexterm" id="id888"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_skillinglearningconsiderations6263100" data-type="indexterm" id="id889"/>.</p>

<h2>Lever 7: Culture Matters—Be a Skills Verb, Not a Noun</h2>

<p>Before you put any plans into action<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="levers of clever for skills program" data-secondary="Lever 7: company culture and leadership action" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_leversofcleverforskillsprogramLever7companycultureandleadershipaction629850"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="company culture" data-secondary="levers of clever for skills program" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_companycultureleversofcleverforskillsprogram629850"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="leadership" data-secondary="company culture and focus on action" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_leadershipcompanycultureandfocusonaction629850"/>, leadership must decide to be verbs when it comes to skilling, not nouns. We’ve seen it many times (even inside IBM; no company is immune): there are leaders who lead by doing and those who hit the sound bites, but that’s about it. And the results are exactly what you’d expect: leaders who lead by doing have teams who know their leader’s values (and understands) their work and the process because they did it themselves; leaders who lead with a sound-bite culture instead of substance will find engagement suffers and execution becomes a game of guesswork rather than guided expertise. One rule we have in the organizations we lead is that we <em>never</em> ask people to do things we would not do or have not already done. For example, if we ask you to test your knowledge or take a course, we are signing up for the test or the course as well—we’ve likely already completed it! To be honest, when you lead like this, dropping real insights on AI like breadcrumbs (just enough to spark curiosity), it makes employees think, “Wait, how do they know that? What am I missing?” It’s the kind of knowledge that makes people want to level up, not because they have to—but because they want to be in on the secret too. Employees are quick to spot imposters, and in the end these leaders come across like those washed-up athletes and celebrities who keep showing up on reality TV shows and no one can remember why they were famous in the first place. But the opposite is true too. Are you a leader, and your employees have to keep up to match your technical skills around GenAI? Now imagine if you’re an executive who has done a piece of learning <em>before</em> you asked everyone to do it. It’s the best preemptive response to the “I don’t have time to do this learning; I’m busy” complaints you’re bound to get from some. The response we suggest is not to play a game of who is busier than who. Be humble. This response is perfect: “We are all busy, and surely none of us are busier than others. But I found time to do it because it’s critical to our collective success. I really want you to be a part of our collective success and I think this is where everyone needs to start.”</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>We already noted how the best employees to find are those who love to learn and are curious, but there’s more to appreciate here than meets the eye. Not only will your upskilling investment be critical to your employee’s success, but it will also be critical to their retention<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="retention, importance of curiosity to employee" data-type="indexterm" id="id890"/>. Your top learners will know that the more they invest in their skills, the more packed their skills suitcase becomes—and there are no overage fees on this airline! In fact, whether they’re looking for a new job, to get promoted, or to demand a higher <span class="keep-together">salary—because</span> of skills scarcity, their current skill set and their willingness to develop it all play in. People who travel with multiple skills suitcases put the onus on their employer to figure out a way to keep them because they’re so valuable. Ironic indeed. In fact, with that investment in upskilling, you’re likely to have a workforce with the current skills you need and a talent pool that stays longer and works harder because they value the investment you’re making in them. A quick search of Reddit comments across the main hiring boards of any tech company will quickly show which companies foster a culture that prioritizes and invests in learning and which don’t. Fun fact for your HR department: it’s highly correlated to the turnover rates.</p>

<p>In the end, reskilling should be positioned as a tailored growth opportunity addressing the whole person. Truth be told, every single one of us who wrote this book have subscribed to this very notion since the beginning of our careers. And for whatever mountains or potholes our accomplishments are to others, they’re all based on the notion that <em>learning never ends</em>, paired with the belief that an investment in the upskilling of an organization becomes not just a competitive advantage but a productivity amplifier.

<h2>Lever 8: Set the Organizational Tone for AI</h2>

<p>You need to set the organization tone<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="levers of clever for skills program" data-secondary="Lever 8: setting organizational tone for AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id893"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_companycultureleversofcleverforskillsprogram629850" data-type="indexterm" id="id894"/> for AI. This includes sharing your organization’s AI strategy <em>with everyone</em>. Don’t forget to include necessary guardrails, what’s appropriate and what’s not, what’s legal and what’s not, what’s risky, and so on.</p>

<p>Engaging employees with transparency is key because many are going to feel your initiatives are targeting their jobs. Remind them that people who get comfortable using AI will replace those who don’t. Explain how their job might change as the rote tasks are shifted to the left. For example, an HR employee whose job is to handle failed department transfers or answer state-to-state (or province-to-province) questions on parental leaves gets their time freed up to help managers plan a more efficient onboarding strategy that gets new hires delivering for the business faster.</p>

<p>And it matters what people are feeling too. You want to create development opportunities and feedback loops to start conversations and bring concerns and such out into the open. One of the killers of culture is the stuff people say at the water cooler (virtual or real) and how they feel. We’ve seen this many times and what happens when you don’t (and when you do) get in front of it. Trust us, part of being a great leader is <em>to take fear out of the room.</em> Flushing out the fears is critical to addressing them. Upskilling your workforce is an invitation and an investment in them! And if you’re serious, you’re in there with them—being vulnerable and sharing what you’ve learned and where you’ve struggled along the way.</p>

<p>Finally, prompt conversations and interactions about all of the above using digital check-ins with support from AI-generated discussion topics. From there, you can use AI to classify the sentiment, create discussions, and start your fear removal plan. You’ll want to ensure employees feel like they have an active role in the learning, expectations, and what they need too. But it’s equally important to just have that done in one place to share feedback, take suggested actions, and schedule manager check-ins. The most important thing you can do is to make sure everyone has the same opportunity; but inevitably, there will be different outcomes based on those who embrace the moment with flair and those who sit and just stare<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_leversofcleverforskillsprogram68827" data-type="indexterm" id="id895"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Case Study: IBM’s Skills Challenge—the CEO Asked; We All Responded" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch06_case_study_ibm_s_skills_challenge_the_ceo_asked_1740182050335964">
<h1>Case Study: IBM’s Skills Challenge—the CEO Asked; <span class="keep-together">We All Responded</span></h1>

<p>The challenge<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="skilling" data-secondary="IBM case study" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_skillingIBMcasestudy631825"/>: increase the AI skills of 280,000 people using a core set of training materials. Offer hands-on training access to IBM’s new watsonx AI platform and products. Make it fun.</p>

<p>In August 2023, at the behest of our CEO, Arvind Krishna<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Krishna, Arvind" data-type="indexterm" id="id896"/>, we created the watsonx Corporate Skills Challenge<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="watsonx Corporate Skills Challenge" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_CorporateSkillsChallenge6319119"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="IBM" data-secondary="watsonx Corporate Skills Challenge" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_IBMCorporateSkillsChallenge6319119"/>—known simply as <em>T</em><em>he Challenge</em>. The Challenge encouraged all IBMers to come up with applications, workflows, assistants, or anything...all in an effort to formulate compelling use cases for putting AI to work. Notice it wasn’t ideas? It’s easy to get a bunch of people to tell you what they want or think AI can do. But this was a <em>very </em>different approach. We wanted people to build these apps and get <em>hands-on</em> experience because we are (again) massively upskilling our employees; in short, we wanted them to stop walking by problems every day that they could solve or make better with technology and do something about it.</p>

<p>IBMers could participate as individuals, but most people, including our C-suite leadership (be a verb, remember), formed teams—over 10,000 of them! This had the benefit of bringing people together (somewhat organically, large in-person scrums spun up where teams would get together in person to generate some of that serendipitous magic that comes from in-person interactions). You got a week of company time to work on The Challenge and pretty much all the compute (within reason; we didn’t let people build their own LLMs from scratch) you needed. And as most companies are trying to find their way back to the office, this offered one heck of a nonpolitical or controversial compelling reason to come together.</p>

<p>A prerequisite gated access to The Challenge: complete assigned training, which included a “stand and deliver.” Pulling from our sales and consulting training practices, we asked everyone at IBM to not just learn the new story of GenAI but to showcase having a conversation about it.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>While it’s outside the scope of this book to talk about (the at times controversial) back-to-the-office policies<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="remote and in-office employees, upskilling" data-type="indexterm" id="id897"/> of companies and the potential that lies within, The Challenge brought people together on their own will with a shared outcome. The Challenge didn’t demand people work in person at all. In fact, some teams had people from across geographies. But many teams got into a lab and worked with people they never knew before...creating new social connections that could help solve future problems, introduce new mentorships, new jobs, and more. If you’re on a management team struggling with bringing people back to the office, this challenge was a great way to not just upskill the masses but also offer a compelling reason to connect in person. Try it!</p>
</div>

<p>There were all kinds of prizes to be won, from IBM watsonx swag to merchandise via our Blue Points program (an internal IBM currency that you can use to buy almost anything), to even dinners with key IBMers with a meet and greet. (Those dinners had a much greater impact than we thought—teams love that opportunity.) The Challenge was so successful in 2023, we ran it again in 2024.</p>

<p>The results? In a word: epic. In 2024, a whopping ~160,000 of our employees (that’s ~60% of our workforce—remember, voluntary) trained on our companies newest AI offerings, sharing our message more confidently and singing from the same song sheet in countries and communities around the world. This time, they created a community in the form of 30,000 teams and made a whopping 8 million inferences (nerd talk for having an AI do what you ask it to do) calls a day! They collectively submitted 12,000+ prototype projects for evaluation. On top of all of this, live testing of 50,000+ workloads, and more than 8,000 pages of feature requests, feature enhancements, usability improvements, resiliency tests, bug reports, and new use cases were identified across the wide suite of IBM watsonx-branded products—channeling a skills growth project into a productivity multiplier. Amazing! And after all that (and why we’re talking about it in this chapter), 88% of IBMers significantly thumbed-up the question, “Did you increase your AI skills in this challenge?”</p>

<p>Both times we ran The Challenge (we even made it repeatable such that one of our VADs ran it for their ecosystem partners), we ended up with thousands of amazing ideas. We picked the top dozen or so and rewarded them, and some of them got all the way to production and completely shifted-left how many IBMers do their work today in 2025. Here are some winning examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>One winning entry was for site reliability engineers (SREs): as applications get containerized and evolve into microservices and function as a service (FaaS) components, it becomes more of a reality that you don’t really build applications anymore, you compose them from discrete pieces of business logic (reminder: the mindset required to modernize the application landscape is the same as that to move from +AI to AI+). Today, these pieces are often distributed across estates (different hyperscalers, clouds, and on premises) that all come together to make a single application. These pieces can run ephemerally and often in under a second. While Agile is terrific for development, it’s become somewhat horrific for SREs—the people who keep stuff running. This winning project used AI to house a corpus of answers to common questions. We’re not talking a FAQ spray-and-pray approach here, we’re talking similarity searching to the task at hand. (Remember the Queen and System of a Down song recommendations we talked about in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_oh_to_be_an_ai_value_creator_1740182046162988">Chapter 2</a>?) Before, this SRE team spent 116 hours a week answering routine questions...today, it’s less than 2 minutes because 99.98% of questions are deflected, leaving deep experts to keep on working and those stuck with near instantaneous frictionless answers. Someone cue the Shift Left theme song!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Another team wanted to better document their code for newcomers to the code base. They had thousands of files, so they took a couple dozen as a pilot and put AI to work, summarizing at the start of the file what the code block did. Each file took about 12 seconds for the code assistant to summarize. Now, early professional hires can have a “conversation” with this code base using watsonx Code Assistant and get instant summaries on how the code block works and what it’s supposed to do. Imagine being new to a code base and asking, “What do you do for high availability of essential services?” and in return get an overview of a library that tells you this is the common client retry logic for any connection, this is the heartbeat detection with seconds to live until a problem is declared, and so on. It’s all right in the code, but anyone who’s taken over blocks of a code base knows that documentation is one of those things that is low on the priority list. Ask any developer, and they’ll tell you how they documented the code, and when you go to look at it, there’s the following: <code><em># TODO: Add documentation to this block</em></code>. These are all part of the use cases we talked about for developers in <span class="keep-together"><a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#ch04_the_use_case_chapter_1740182047877425">Chapter 4</a></span>.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can tell, IBM put a large investment into The Challenge. We think participants have become much more interesting to our clients because of it. Interestingly enough, employees we talk to tell us they’re more job marketable too. Of course, we don’t want them to leave IBM—but those that put the effort into The Challenge clearly found that secret zipper that expands their skills suitcase to get more packed in case they decide to journey elsewhere. But as we always say, our employees’ jobs are to come to work every day and give us the best they’ve got on that day (it can vary). Our job? Give them a reason to come to work every day and give us the best they’ve got on that day. We think building something and stuffing your skills suitcase are great reasons beyond a paycheck (which is important) to come to work every day<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_skillingIBMcasestudy631825" data-type="indexterm" id="id898"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_CorporateSkillsChallenge6319119" data-type="indexterm" id="id899"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_IBMCorporateSkillsChallenge6319119" data-type="indexterm" id="id900"/>.</p>

<h1>The Final Word</h1>

<p>There are groups of people<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job security, and digital labor" data-type="indexterm" id="id901"/> who will surely feel that once you make people more productive, you will eventually need fewer of them. As we noted with bank tellers, <em>that</em><em>’</em><em>s actually been false in history</em>. Think about it: if you are more productive, that means you have a natural economic advantage against your competition, which means you’re going to get more work, which means you’re going to need more people. We think sometimes people forget that—they come from a zero-sum mentality to say it’s a zero-sum game. So yes, certain roles will shrink because you don’t need so many people doing them (maybe, email responses or phone calls), but then it will shift to maybe building more applications or digital sales, and so on.</p>

<p>So, there will be a shift—yes, the first bucket decreases, and everybody fixates on that, but there’s no doubt about it, a second bucket is filling with new jobs, workflows, and new ways of working. AI is not just about an increase in productivity, or a reduction in <span class="keep-together">processes</span>, or an automation that replaces people, or an insurance policy against your competitors. By creating an inventory and a plan to upskill, you’re fueling your workforce with skills and, in time, will open your organization to new unforeseen innovations and efficiency.</p>

<p>The innovations that await could reinvent your industry or make a new market. And that’s an ROI that the whole senior leadership team can and should get behind. This is why we (perhaps surprisingly to you) spent a lot of time on AI skilling in our book—and while we’re at it, don’t limit this to technical or sales staff, your efforts must be pushed out more broadly across the entire enterprise, in every line of business. Are you ready to level up some learning?</p>
