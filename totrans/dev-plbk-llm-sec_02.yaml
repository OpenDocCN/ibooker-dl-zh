- en: In the spring of 2023, I began researching security vulnerabilities specific
    to LLMs. At the time, there was a relatively large body of research on security
    for AI in general, but very little organized research about LLMs. However, I did
    find some research papers and blogs that covered some ideas in the area. I began
    the process of collecting these research papers and summarizing them using ChatGPT.
    Eventually, I provided a few examples from the current Top 10 list of web application
    vulnerabilities and asked ChatGPT to generate a draft Top 10 for LLMs in a similar
    format.

  zh: 2023年春季，我开始研究针对LLM的特定安全漏洞。当时，关于AI的一般安全研究相对较多，但关于LLM的组织化研究却非常少。然而，我确实找到了一些涵盖该领域一些想法的研究论文和博客。我开始收集这些研究论文，并使用ChatGPT进行总结。最终，我从当前Web应用漏洞Top
    10列表中提供了一些例子，并要求ChatGPT以类似格式为LLM生成一个草拟的Top 10。
- en: I thought what came out looked interesting, so I sent it to Jeff Williams, a
    founder of OWASP, the Open Worldwide Application Security Project, to see what
    he thought. Jeff, Contrast Security’s chief technology officer, wrote the first
    OWASP Top 10 list in 2001\. His goal was to create an accessible resource for
    developers that detailed the most critical risks and vulnerable areas of web applications.
    At the time, the World Wide Web was still only a few years old, and most developers
    had little to no understanding of how to create secure web applications. That
    original Top 10 list became a seminal work and a foundational resource in application
    security.

  zh: 我认为结果看起来很有趣，所以我把东西发给了OWASP的创始人之一，杰夫·威廉姆斯，看看他的看法。杰夫是Contrast Security的首席技术官，他在2001年编写了第一个OWASP
    Top 10列表。他的目标是创建一个对开发者来说易于获取的资源，详细说明了Web应用中最关键的风险和易受攻击的区域。当时，万维网还只有几年历史，大多数开发者对如何创建安全的Web应用几乎一无所知。那个原始的Top
    10列表成为了一项开创性的工作，并在应用安全领域成为了一个基础资源。
- en: I didn’t tell Jeff that my list was primarily machine generated. As the original
    Top 10 list’s author, I figured he could give me an idea of whether my Top 10
    list looked novel and worth pursuing. Jeff encouraged me to petition the OWASP
    board for approval to spin it up as a new project. A few weeks later, the OWASP
    board approved the project, and I announced it, along with a link to a refined
    version of the draft Top 10 I’d generated with ChatGPT.

    of problems with that initial version, and the team was aggressive about pointing
    them out. At the same time, we began to create a wiki page with links to all the
    resources the group found on LLM security issues. It turned out a lot had been

- en: The second sprint was to generate a new version of the list. This time, rather
    than being the work of a single person and an AI, it would be the product of the
    collective wisdom of our expert team, which continued to grow week by week. In
    the first week, the group focused on generating ideas for the Top 10 list. We
    published a template and asked the group to submit candidate vulnerabilities.
    In that week, we developed 43 detailed descriptions of possible areas. We then
    conducted two rounds of voting using Google Forms, leveraging the team’s collective
    wisdom to narrow the list to 10, which we published as version 0.5\. This version
    was far more detailed and comprehensive than version 0.1\. The positive reception

    each vulnerability type and chose a volunteer as the entry lead for each item.
    Subteams of 10 to 30 individuals then fleshed out and tuned each entry. Again,
    we included a round of voting for the whole team to be involved and point out
    weak areas that needed more attention. Along the way, we found some entries overlapped
    and merged them. This change created space to pull up some entries that had fallen
    below the 10 item cut-off. The result of this sprint became version 0.9 of the
    list. Interestingly, the word count of version 0.9 was about 33% shorter than
    0.5; the extra time and refinement had allowed the subteams to focus their thinking
    and make the entries punchy and tight.
