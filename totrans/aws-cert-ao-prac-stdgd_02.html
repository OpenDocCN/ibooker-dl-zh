<p>The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Certified AI Practitioner certification—which<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="exam for AIF-C01" data-secondary="code  AIF-C01" id="id364"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="exam for AIF-C01" data-secondary="about" id="id365"/> has the exam code of AIF-C01—is focused at the entry level for artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and generative AI. The exam addresses numerous AWS tools.</p>
<p>According to Jenni Troutman, who<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Troutman, Jenni" id="id366"/> is the director of Products and Services at AWS Training and Certification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The AWS Certified AI Practitioner exam is a foundational AI certification that is designed for people from a variety of backgrounds and experiences to show their understanding of AI and generative AI concepts, their ability to recognize opportunities that benefit from AI, and their knowledge on using AI tools responsibly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you already know about these topics, this will certainly help with the exam. But it is not a requirement. This book will provide what you need to know, breaking down the concepts that are covered in the exam. There are also sample questions at the end of each chapter, as well as a practice exam.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The reasons to take the exam</p></li>
<li><p>The audience for it</p></li>
<li><p>Topics covered in the exam</p></li>
<li><p>Other certifications to consider</p></li>

<p>Let’s take a closer look.</p>

<h2>Recognition</h2>
<p>The certification makes a statement. It shows employers that you understand the basics of AI, along with AWS, which is Amazon’s massive cloud platform. You can also highlight the certification among your network, such as on LinkedIn, with a digital badge for your profile.</p>
<p>Even if you do not plan to pursue an AI role, the certification will still be valuable. After all, when it comes to many jobs nowadays—whether in sales, marketing, legal, and so on—there is usually a need to understand AI.</p>

Businesses have been investing heavily in AI so as to bolster efficiency and productivity. But this powerful technology can also be a driver for growth by unlocking insights from corporate data.</p>
<p>Of course, this means businesses will need AI-savvy employees. According to a <a href="https://oreil.ly/LnhJq">study commissioned by AWS</a>, over 90% of employers expect to adopt AI-related solutions within the next five years. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary=" AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer" id="id368"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="certification" data-secondary="AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer" id="id369"/>Some of the companies that have been training employees for the AWS Certified AI Practitioner and AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer (associate certifications) include Capgemini, Cognizant, Compass, Deloitte, DXC Technology, EPAM, Kyndryl, N-iX, SoftwareOne, Tata <span class="keep-together">Consultancy</span> Services, and Wipro.</p>

<h2>Boosting Your Salary, Productivity, and Career with AI Skills</h2>
<p>“Having AI skills can improve productivity,” said Troutman.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Troutman, Jenni" id="id375"/> “In fact, 88% of workers expect to use AI in their daily work by 2028 to automate repetitive tasks and drive creativity. In our own research, we also found that employees who have AWS certifications have improved their interactions with their technical colleagues and <span class="keep-together">customers.”</span></p>
<p>In light of these benefits,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="compensation for AI skills" id="id376"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="salaries and AI skills" id="id377"/> there has been strong gains in compensation for those with AI skills. Consider a <a href="https://oreil.ly/lzppR">November 2023 AWS study</a>. It shows that their salaries are generally 43% higher for those in sales and marketing roles, 42% higher for finance roles, 41% higher for business operations roles, and 47% higher for IT specialists.</p>
<p>Then what about those who have AI roles? Here’s a look at the average compensation levels in the United States, according to data from <a href="https://oreil.ly/eRa7e">Coursera</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Data analyst</dt>
<dd><p>This person can earn a starting salary from $60,000 to $90,000. This depends on a person’s background and location. For example, a data analyst living in San Francisco earns an average of $95,000.</p></dd>
<dt>AI developer</dt>
<dd><p>An AI developer or ML engineer builds, deploys, and monitors AI projects and models. They understand languages like Python and various frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn. An AI developer earns anywhere from $85,000 to $120,000 per year.</p></dd>
<dt>Project manager</dt>
<dd><p>A project manager can earn from $90,000 to $130,000 annually. Their salary depends on their skill sets and the complexity of the projects they manage.</p></dd>
<dt>Sales specialist for AI solutions</dt>
<dd><p>The salary is typically between $70,000 and $110,000 per year, but the compensation can be much higher because of commissions.</p></dd>

<p>The exam contains 65 questions,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="exam for AIF-C01" data-secondary="details" id="id398"/> of which 50 are scored and 15 are unscored (these are not disclosed). The unscored questions don’t impact your final score because they are experimental. They are a way to help AWS evaluate these questions for future exams.</p>

To pass, you need at least 700. The scoring system is scaled based on different versions of the exam, which have slightly different difficulty levels. The scoring system is also compensatory. In other words, you do not have to get a passing score on each section. What matters is the overall score.</p>

<p>If you don’t pass the exam, you’ll need to wait 14 days before retaking it. There’s no limit on the number of attempts, but you’ll have to pay the fee each time.</p>
<p>When you take the exam, you won’t see your pass/fail status immediately. Instead, the results will show up in your AWS Certification Account under Exam History within five business days.</p>

For example, there are <a href="https://oreil.ly/0G3Xd">online courses for the AIF-C01 exam</a>. One is free, and the others require a fee.</p>
<p>So then, why read this book if AWS already has these resources? With this book, you will dive deeper into the concepts. There are many real-world examples, sample questions, as well as a glossary. The glossary is important for the many questions that are based on definitions.</p>
<p>Finally, for many people, they prefer to learn from a book!</p>
