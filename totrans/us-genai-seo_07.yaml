    plate, and technical SEO tasks can be time-consuming. You can use generative AI
    to make their job easier and improve the quality of their work. As with creating
    content, you will need to check the output of your generative AI tools. For example,
    you might have a developer review code written by your tool or have an experienced
    SEO practitioner review keywords that your tool has recommended.

    of technical SEO work and empower your staff to be more efficient. The benefits
    of using generative AI to do this work include increasing the throughput of completing
    the work, reducing costs, and potentially even decreasing errors. This idea of
    reducing errors with AI may seem counterintuitive, given the need for a thorough
    review of generative AI outputs, but your SEO team and developers can make errors,
    too. Employing both generative AI and humans increases the potential of reducing
    the total number of errors in these tasks.

    as input and then give you a list of closely related keywords and their estimated
    search volume. However, these tools tend to be narrowly focused in how they make
    suggestions, and they don’t always provide a view of concepts that are closely
    related to your seed keyword. For example, [Figure 5-1](#ch05_figure_1_1748358218120844)
    shows the output from Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool after giving it the seed keyword
    “ultrasound technician.”

    that you’re not unintentionally redirecting other content.
