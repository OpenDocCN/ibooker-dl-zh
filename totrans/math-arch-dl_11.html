<p class="body"><a id="marker-438"/>This is a short chapter that briefly introduces (barely scratching the surface of) a topic that could fill an entire mathematics textbook. A rigorous or even comprehensive treatment of manifolds is beyond the scope of this book. Instead, this chapter primarily focuses on geometric intuitions required for deep learning.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="manifolds">12.1 Manifolds</h2>
<p class="body">A <i class="fm-italics">manifold</i> is a generalization of the notions of curve, surface, and volume into a unified concept that works in arbitrary dimensions. In machine learning, the input space can be viewed as a manifold. Usually, the input manifold is not very conducive to classification. We need to transform (map) that manifold to a different manifold that is friendlier to the classification problem at hand. This is what a neural network does.</p>
<p class="body">In a multilayered neural network, each layer transforms (maps) from one manifold to another. For the classification problem, the end manifold is expected to be one where the classes can be separated by a linear surface (hyperplane). The last layer provides this linear separator. Figure <a class="url" href="#fig-manifold_mapping_for_classification">12.1</a> provides an example of a transformation to a space where classification is easier.</p>

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 12.1 The input points lie on a cylindrical manifold (surface). Here, the two input classes (indicated by + and -, respectively) <i class="fm-italics">cannot</i> be separated linearly. If we unroll (map) the cylinder surface into a plane, the two classes <i class="fm-italics">can</i> be separated linearly.</p>
</div>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-439"/>Unlike physical surfaces we see and touch in everyday life, manifolds are not limited to three dimensions. Human imagination may fail in visualizing higher-dimension manifolds, but we can typically use three-dimensional analogies as surrogates—they often work, although not always. A neural network layer or sequence of layers can be viewed as mapping points from one manifold to another.</p>
<p class="body">Manifolds are locally Euclidean. To get an intuitive understanding of this, imagine a circle with a very thin string wrapped around it. Now, take any point on the circle and take a small arc of the circle containing that point. If we cut off the portion of the string corresponding to that segment, we can straighten that little piece of string into a straight line without twisting or tearing it. In other words, the small neighborhood on the circle around the chosen point has 1:1 mapping with a line segment. All points on the circle satisfy this property. Such a curve is said to be <i class="fm-italics">locally Euclidean</i>. The concept can be extended to higher dimensions. Consider the surface of a sphere (this is an example of a <span class="math">2</span>-manifold). Imagine a rubber sheet tightly fitted around the sphere. Take an arbitrary point and a small patch of the spherical surface containing the point (see figure <a class="url" href="#fig-sphere_patch">12.2c</a>). If we cut off the rubber sheet corresponding to the patch, it can be flattened into a plane without twisting or tearing. So, the sphere surface is locally Euclidean. The torus surface (donut-shaped object) is another example of a <span class="math">2</span>-manifold. In general, <i class="timesitalic">d</i>-manifold is a space (set of points) on which every point has a small neighborhood of points in the space that contains the point and can be mapped 1:1 to <span class="math">ℝ<i class="fm-italics"><sup class="fm-superscript">d</sup></i></span> without twisting or tearing. For instance, a circle is a <span class="math">1</span>D manifold, and every point on it has a container arc that can be mapped to a line (<span class="math">ℝ<sup class="fm-superscript">1</sup></span>). A sphere surface is <span class="math">2</span>D manifold, and every point of it has a containing patch that maps 1:1 to a plane (<span class="math">ℝ<sup class="fm-superscript">2</sup></span>). We say manifolds are locally Euclidean. Figure <a class="url" href="#fig-manifolds_nonmanifolds">12.2</a> illustrates the concept.<a id="marker-440"/></p>

<p class="body">A little thought will reveal that the locally Euclidean property makes calculus possible. For instance, how do we compute the area under a curve, <span class="math"><i class="fm-italics">f</i>(<i class="fm-italics">x</i>)</span> in the interval <span class="math"><i class="fm-italics">x</i> = <i class="fm-italics">a</i></span> and <span class="math"><i class="fm-italics">x</i> = <i class="fm-italics">b</i></span>? The formula is <span class="math"><i class="fm-italics">∫<sub class="fm-subscript">x=a</sub><sup class="fm-superscript">x=b</sup></i> <i class="fm-italics">f</i>(<i class="fm-italics">x</i>) <i class="fm-italics">dx</i></span>. We take infinitesimally small segments of the curve and pretend they are straight lines, which can be projected onto a tiny line segment on the <i class="timesitalic">X</i> axis. The resulting narrow quadrilateral can be approximated by a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the <i class="timesitalic">X</i> and <i class="timesitalic">Y</i> axes. We sum (integrate) the areas of all the tiny rectangles that cover the same area as the one we are computing (see figure <a class="url" href="#fig-area_under_curve">12.3</a>). This scheme depends on the ability to represent tiny segments of the curve as straight lines. A similar case can be made about computing the length of the curve segment. In higher dimensions, the same idea applies: calculus is dependent on the ability to pretend that a curve or surface can be locally approximated by something flat. The graph of any <i class="fm-italics">continuous</i> vector function <span class="math"><span class="infigure"><img alt="" class="calibre15" height="29" src="../../OEBPS/Images/AR_y.png" width="15"/></span> = <i class="fm-italics">f</i>(<span class="infigure"><img alt="" class="calibre9" height="24" src="../../OEBPS/Images/AR_x.png" width="14"/></span>)</span>, where <span class="times"><img alt="" class="calibre9" height="24" src="../../OEBPS/Images/AR_x.png" width="14"/></span> is any open subset of <span class="math">ℝ<i class="fm-italics"><sup class="fm-superscript">n</sup></i></span>—that is, <span class="math"><span class="infigure"><img alt="" class="calibre9" height="24" src="../../OEBPS/Images/AR_x.png" width="14"/></span> <span class="cambria">∈</span> <span class="segoe">𝕌</span> ⊂ ℝ<i class="fm-italics"><sup class="fm-superscript">n</sup></i></span> and <span class="math"><i class="fm-italics">f</i>(<span class="infigure"><img alt="" class="calibre15" height="29" src="../../OEBPS/Images/AR_y.png" width="15"/></span>) <span class="cambria">∈</span> ℝ<i class="fm-italics"><sup class="fm-superscript">m</sup></i></span>—yields a manifold in <span class="math">(<span class="infigure"><img alt="" class="calibre9" height="24" src="../../OEBPS/Images/AR_x.png" width="14"/></span>, <span class="infigure"><img alt="" class="calibre15" height="29" src="../../OEBPS/Images/AR_y.png" width="15"/></span>)</span> in <span class="math">ℝ<i class="fm-italics"><sup class="fm-superscript">m</sup></i> × ℝ<i class="fm-italics"><sup class="fm-superscript">n</sup></i></span>.<a id="marker-441"/></p>

<p class="body">In this context, note that the entire sphere <i class="fm-italics">cannot</i> be mapped to a plane (try opening the sphere onto a plane). This is why it is impossible to draw a perfect map of the globe on a piece of paper with all regions drawn to scale. Typically, the polar regions occupy areas disproportionately large on the paper map. But small patches on the spherical surface can be mapped onto planes, which is enough to call this surface a manifold. Hence the word <i class="fm-italics">local</i> in locally Euclidean.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="hausdorff-property">12.1.1 Hausdorff property</h3>
<p class="body">Manifolds usually have another property, known as the Hausdorff property. If we take any pair of points on a manifold—no matter how close they are—we can find a pair of <i class="fm-italics">disjoint</i> neighborhoods around the respective points consisting entirely of points on the manifold. Loosely speaking, this means if we take any pair of points on the manifold, we can find an infinite number of points between them, all belonging to the manifold. This is illustrated in figure <a class="url" href="#fig-hausdorff">12.4</a>. It’s easy to see that this is true for the real line (<span class="math">ℝ<sup class="fm-superscript">1</sup></span>): take any pair of points, and there are enough points between them to create a disjoint pair of neighborhoods centered on each.</p>

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="second-countable-property">12.1.2 Second countable property</h3>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-442"/>Manifolds are second-countable. To explain this, we will first briefly outline a few concepts. (Disclaimer: the following explanations err toward ease of understanding as opposed to mathematical rigor.)</p>
<p class="fm-head2" id="open-sets-closed-sets-and-boundaries">Open sets, closed sets, and boundaries</p>
<p class="body">Consider the set of points belonging to the interval <span class="math"><i class="fm-italics">A</i> ≡ 0 &lt; <i class="fm-italics">x</i> &lt; 1</span> (you can imagine it to be a segment of the real line). Take any point in this set <i class="timesitalic">A</i>, say <span class="math"><i class="fm-italics">x</i> = 0.93</span>. You can find a point on its left (say, <span class="math">0.92</span>) and on its right say, <span class="math">0.94</span>), both of which are in the same set <i class="timesitalic">A</i>. In some sense, the point is surrounded by points belonging to the same set. Hence it is an <i class="fm-italics">internal</i> point. The funny thing is, in this set, <i class="fm-italics">all points are internal</i>. In comparison, consider the set <span class="math"><i class="fm-italics">A<sub class="fm-subscript">c</sub></i> ≡ 0 ≤ <i class="fm-italics">x</i> ≤ 1</span>. This includes the previous set <i class="timesitalic">A</i> as well as the <i class="fm-italics">boundary</i> points <span class="math"><i class="fm-italics">x</i> = 0</span> and <span class="math"><i class="fm-italics">x</i> = 1</span>. Note that the boundary points can be approached from both inside and outside the set <i class="timesitalic">A</i>. If we take a small neighborhood of any point in the boundary, consisting of all points within a small distance <i class="timesitalic">ϵ</i>, there are points inside and outside <i class="timesitalic">A</i>. <i class="timesitalic">A</i> is an open set. If we add its boundary to itself, it becomes a closed set <i class="timesitalic">A<sub class="fm-subscript">c</sub></i>.</p>
<p class="body">The concept extends to higher dimensions. For instance, the set of <span class="math">2</span>D points belonging to the unit disc <span class="math"><i class="fm-italics">S</i> ≡ <i class="fm-italics">x</i><sup class="fm-superscript">2</sup> + <i class="fm-italics">y</i><sup class="fm-superscript">2</sup> &lt; 1</span> is an open set. If we add the boundary—the circle <span class="math"><i class="fm-italics">S<sub class="fm-subscript">c</sub></i> ≡ <i class="fm-italics">x</i><sup class="fm-superscript">2</sup> + <i class="fm-italics">y</i><sup class="fm-superscript">2</sup> = 1</span>—we get a closed set. All this is illustrated in figure <a class="url" href="#fig-openset">12.5</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre5" height="373" id="fig-openset" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH12_F05_Chaudhury.png" width="374"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 12.5 The open set, disk without a boundary is shown in gray. The boundary is shown in black. Gray+black is the closed set.</p>
</div>
<p class="fm-head2" id="bounded-compact-and-precompact-sets">Bounded, compact, and precompact sets</p>
<p class="body">A set is said to be bounded if all its points lie within a fixed distance of each other. The sets <i class="timesitalic">A</i>, <i class="timesitalic">A<sub class="fm-subscript">c</sub></i>, and <i class="timesitalic">S</i>, <i class="timesitalic">S<sub class="fm-subscript">c</sub></i> discussed previously are bounded. A <i class="fm-italics">compact</i> set is <i class="fm-italics">bounded as well as closed</i>. The sets <i class="timesitalic">A<sub class="fm-subscript">c</sub></i> and <i class="timesitalic">S<sub class="fm-subscript">c</sub></i> are compact. And a set is <i class="fm-italics">precompact</i> if it can be converted into a compact set by just adding its boundary (for example, <i class="timesitalic">A</i> and <i class="timesitalic">S</i>). Note that not all open sets are precompact: for example, <span class="math">−∞ &lt; <i class="fm-italics">x</i> &lt; ∞</span> is open but not precompact. All precompact sets are open, however.</p>
<p class="body">Manifolds may or may not include a boundary. A disc is a <span class="math">2</span>-manifold with a boundary. Its boundary is the circle’s circumference, which is a <span class="math">1</span>-manifold. A three-dimensional ball is a <span class="math">3</span>-manifold with a boundary. The boundary is the surface of the sphere, which is a <span class="math">2</span>-manifold. The open set of points on the disc sans the boundary is also a <span class="math">2</span>-manifold. A square area is a <span class="math">2</span>-manifold with a boundary whose boundary is the square, which is a <span class="math">1</span>-manifold. A three-dimensional cube is a <span class="math">3</span>-manifold with a boundary whose boundary is a <span class="math">2</span>-manifold corresponding to the surface of the cube. In general, the boundary of a <i class="timesitalic">d</i>-manifold with boundary is a <span class="math"><i class="fm-italics">d</i> − 1</span>-manifold.</p>
<p class="body">Now, let’s go back to the second countable property of manifolds. The second countable property of a manifold implies that every manifold has a basis of open sets. This means for every manifold <i class="timesitalic">M</i>, there exists a countable collection <span class="math"><i class="fm-italics">U</i> ≡ {<i class="fm-italics">U<sub class="fm-subscript">i</sub></i>}</span>, where <i class="timesitalic">U<sub class="fm-subscript">i</sub></i> are precompact subsets of <i class="timesitalic">M</i> and any open subsets of <i class="timesitalic">M</i> can be expressed as a union of elements of <i class="timesitalic">U</i>. This is illustrated in figure <a class="url" href="#fig-second-countable">12.6</a>.<a id="marker-443"/></p>

<h2 class="fm-head" id="homeomorphism">12.2 Homeomorphism</h2>
<p class="body">We have been speaking about 1:1 mappings between an arc of a circle and a line segment. If we have a piece of string tightly fitted on the arc, all we have to do is to grab the string’s two ends and pull it out to get the corresponding straight line—we do not have to do any twisting or tearing (see the black arc in figure <a class="url" href="#fig-manifolds_1d">12.2</a>). Similarly, the mapping between a patch on the surface of a sphere can be mapped 1:1 to a plane by simply pulling an imaginary rubber sheet fitted on the patch (see the patch in figure <a class="url" href="#fig-sphere_patch">12.2c</a>). These are examples of a general class of mappings called <i class="fm-italics">homeomorphism</i>. Formally, a homeomorphic mapping comprises a pair of functions <i class="timesitalic">f</i> and <span class="math"><i class="fm-italics">f</i><sup class="fm-superscript">−1</sup></span> between two sets of points <i class="timesitalic">X</i> and <i class="timesitalic">Y</i> such that</p><!--<p class="Body"><span class="times">$$\begin{aligned}

<p class="body">Note that all of these operations, multiplication with the weight matrix <i class="timesitalic">W</i>, translation by <span class="infigure"><img alt="" class="calibre9" height="24" src="../../OEBPS/Images/AR_b.png" width="14"/></span>, and the sigmoid nonlinearity are continuous invertible functions. Hence, they are homeomorphisms. The composite operation where these are applied in sequence is another homeomorphism.

<p class="body">One way to view a multilayered neural network is that the successive layers homeomorphically transform the input manifold so that it becomes easier and easier to separate the classes. The final layer may be a simple linear separator (as in figure <a class="url" href="#fig-homeomorphism">12.7</a>).<a id="marker-445"/></p>

<ul class="calibre6">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">A manifold is a hyperdimensional collection of points space) that satisfies three properties: locally Euclidean, Hausdorff, and second countable.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">A <i class="timesitalic">d</i>-manifold is a space in which every point has a small neighborhood that contains the point and can be mapped 1:1 to a subregion of <span class="math">ℝ<i class="fm-italics"><sup class="fm-superscript">d</sup></i></span> without folding, twisting, or tearing. In other words, the local neighborhood around any point on a manifold can be approximated by something flat. For instance, a continuous curve in <span class="math">3</span>D space is a <span class="math">1</span>-manifold: if we imagine the curve as a string, any local neighborhood is a substring that can be pulled and straightened into a straight line. Any continuous surface in <span class="math">3</span>D is a <span class="math">2</span>-manifold: if we imagine the surface as a rubber membrane, any local neighborhood can be pulled and stretched into a flat planar patch. This property (the ability to pretend that a curve or a surface can be locally replaced by a linear piece) is what enables us to perform calculus.</p>

<p class="list">Homeomorphism is a special class of transformation mapping) that transforms one manifold to another via stretching/squishing without tearing, breaking, or folding.</p>

<p class="list">Roughly speaking, a neural network layer can be viewed as a homeomorphic transform that maps points from its input manifold to an output manifold that is (hopefully) more suitable for the end goal. The entire multilayered perceptron (neural network) can be viewed as a sequence of homeomorphisms that, in a series of steps, transform the input manifold to a manifold that makes the end goal easier. In particular, a classifier neural network maps the input manifold to an output manifold where the points belonging to different classes are well-separated.<a id="marker-446"/></p>
