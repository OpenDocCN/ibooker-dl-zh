- en: Since OpenAI introduced GPT-2 in early 2019, large language models (LLMs) have
    rapidly changed our world. In 2019, if you, as a coder, had a technical question,
    then you would search the internet for an answer. More often than not, there would
    be no answer, leaving only the option to post on some question-and-answer (Q&A)
    forum in the possibly vain hope that *someone* might answer you. But today, instead
    of breaking your flow, you just ask an LLM assistant for direct commentary on
    the code you’re working on. Moreover, you can even engage in a pairing session
    where the assistant writes the code to your specifications. This is just in the
    field of software engineering, and similar tectonic shifts are beginning to be
    felt in almost any field that you can name.

- en: The reason that this revolution is taking place is because the LLM is truly
    a revolutionary technology that makes it possible to achieve in software what
    formerly could be done only through human interaction. LLMs can generate content,
    answer questions, extract tabular data from natural language text, summarize text,
    classify documents, translate, and (in principle) do just about anything that
    you can do with text—except that LLMs will do it many orders of magnitude faster
    and never stop for a break.

- en: For entrepreneurs, this opens endless doors of opportunity in every field imaginable.
    But before you can take advantage of these opportunities, you have to be prepared.
    This book serves as a guide to help you understand LLMs, interact with them through
    prompt engineering, and build applications that will bring value to your users,
    your company, or yourself.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is written for application engineers. If you build software products
    that customers use, then this book is for you. If you build internal applications
    or data-processing workflows, then this book is also for you. The reason that
    we are being so inclusive is because we believe that the usage of LLMs will soon
    become ubiquitous. Even if your day-to-day work doesn’t involve prompt engineering
    or LLM workflow design, your codebase will be filled with usages of LLMs, and
    you’ll need to understand how to interact with them just to get your job done.

- en: However, a subset of application engineers will be the dedicated LLM wranglers—these
    are the *prompt engineers*. It’s their job to convert problems into a packet of
    information that the LLM can understand—which we call the *prompt*—and then convert
    the LLM completions back into results that bring value to those who use the application.
    If this is your current role—or if you want this to be your role—then this book
    is *especially* for you.

- en: LLMs are very approachable—you speak with them in natural language. So, for
    this book, you won’t be expected to know everything about machine learning. But
    you do need to have a good grasp of basic engineering principles—you need to know
    how to program and how to use an API. Another prerequisite for this book is the
    ability to empathize, because unlike with any technology before, you need to understand
    how LLMs “think” so that you can guide them to generate the content you need.
    This book will show you how.

    and tricks you need to master prompt engineering and build successful LLM applications.

- en: In [Part I](part01.html#part01) of the book, we convey a foundational understanding
    of LLMs, their inner workings, and their functionality as text completion engines.
    We cover the extension of LLMs to their new role as chat engines, and we present
    a high-level approach to LLM application development.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In [Part II](part02.html#part02), we introduce the core techniques for prompt
    engineering—how to source context information, rank its importance for the task
    at hand, pack the prompt (without overloading it), and organize everything into
    a template that will result in high-quality completions that elicit the answer
    you need.

- en: In [Part III](part03.html#part03), we move to more advanced techniques. We assemble
    loops, pipelines, and workflows of LLM inference to create conversational agency
    and LLM-driven workflows, and we then explain techniques for evaluating LLMs.

    see during their training.

- en: 'If you process that statement deeply, then you’ll arrive at the same conclusions
    that we share throughout this book: when you want an LLM to behave a certain way,
    you have to shape the prompt to resemble patterns seen in training data—use clear
    language, rely upon existing patterns rather than creating new ones, and don’t
    drown the LLM in superfluous content. Once you master prompt engineering, you
    can build upon these skills by creating conversation agency and workflows—the
    dominant paradigms for LLM applications.'
