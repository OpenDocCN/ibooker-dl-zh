<h1><span class="label">Chapter 4. </span>The Use Case Chapter</h1>

<p>There are lots of studies<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_usecases4335"/> that suggest the productivity<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="productivity" data-secondary="taking advantage of potential in AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id561"/> potential that could come from GenAI, especially agents. Thinking back to the equations we talked about in the last chapter, can you see the opportunity? But just how big is it? Trying to peg that is like choosing between backstage passes to a Metallica concert or having a role in the next <em>Deadpool</em> movie—it’s going to be epic either way, but you have no idea which one would make your heart pound harder. For now, let’s assume that GenAI could unlock upwards of $10 trillion in productivity over the few years and up to $20 trillion by the end of the decade (our consensus by aggregating all the reports we’ve come across). What part of that is your company going to capture? And that’s only the beginning: we believe, as does just about anyone else writing about the wonders of AI, that this is just the beginning of never-before-imagined new business models and products. After all, staying at some stranger’s house during a business trip seemed ludicrous until some sold-out San Francisco conference, and just like that, Airbnb was born. So why not use the productivity benefits available now to test and refine your uses of AI, your governance models, training, management of data, and the like, all along a path of thinking differently about the future?</p>

<p>As business leaders, we are continually faced with important decisions about how we will drive ROI for our places of work. Now, more than ever, we face a critical moment with the confluence of hybrid cloud and AI. As these technologies reach critical stages of maturity, we need to embrace them to build competitive advantage and fuel innovation.</p>

<p>This Netscape moment allows all of us to rethink our technology landscapes to make the most of not only this momentous AI opportunity, but also the technologies that will follow it. Bringing together the right elements will mean the difference between leading in your industry or being left behind.</p>

<p>Business AI is about value creation, and value creation comes from the right use cases. The decisions you make today will have a profound impact on your tomorrow. In this chapter, we’ll delve into more use cases and expand on the framework we gave you to classify them back in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_ai_to_ai_generative_ai_and_the_netscape_moment_1740182043982974">Chapter 1</a>. Obviously, an entire book could be written on a single industry’s use cases alone, so in this chapter we’ll try to build your acumen even further by adding to our use case classification model, steering you toward the use cases we’re confident are the best places to start, sharing even more industry-specific use cases with you, and commenting on the horizontalness (by which we mean they cross industry vertical lines) of GenAI and agentic use cases, all in an effort to help you unlock the genius within.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>We want to give you a use case<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="industry search for" data-type="indexterm" id="id562"/> cheat code: the best way to find GenAI use cases for your industry is simply to do a traditional (or GenAI) web search. There are what seems to be an unlimited number of papers, articles, and coverage on industry use cases. Consultants (such as IBM, Deloitte, McKinsey, and others) publish lots of them, as do technology companies and practitioners. We’re not just telling you this because we can’t cover them all here. To be honest, sometimes we come across sellers who ask us for use cases for the industry they cover. When we hear this, we give them the benefit of the doubt that they don’t know this cheat code. Because if they did, then we’d just tell them they’re lazy. That sounds harsh, but that’s how much information is out there. Seriously, you’d be shocked at how fast you can get deep into an industry’s AI use cases with very little effort.</p>
</div>

<p>Recall the <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03_equations_for_generative_ai_persuasion_1740182046765298">Chapter 3</a> equation for AI success was the additive power of four things: Models + Data + Governance + Use Cases. If LLMs, data, and governance are the “scaffolding,” then use cases are the “palace” you create—the true value generator.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="The Use Case Value Creation Curve" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch04_the_use_case_value_creation_curve_1740182047877623">
<h1>The Use Case Value Creation Curve</h1>

<p>So far in this book<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="creation curve for" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_usecasescreationcurvefor41331"/>, we’ve given you several tools that will help you identify use cases that are tried, tested, and true. In the same way an electrician has a tool belt with tools (wire strippers, cutters, insulated screwdrivers, voltage testers, and more), we are giving you use case tools for your AI tool belt to help you confidently steer your organization to some shocking (but in a good way) results.</p>

<p>Pause for a moment to reflect on the tools we’ve given you so far. In <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_ai_to_ai_generative_ai_and_the_netscape_moment_1740182043982974">Chapter 1</a>, we gave you a set of acumen curves to place use cases, a classification scheme on budget (spend to make or spend to save), and an overlay classification scheme on what the AI will do (automate, optimize, or predict). In this section, we’ll give you another tool that will help you define high-impact AI use cases for your business.</p>

<p>Look at <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_1_1740182047851247">Figure 4-1</a> and put yourself into the mindset of famed United Kingdom ski jumper<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id563" id="id563-marker">1</a></sup> and underdog folk hero Eddie “the Eagle” Edwards, only this ramp launches you into your AI future. The early parts of this ramp start off somewhat cautiously (Experimentation). You build speed in this part—it’s called the <em>inrun</em> in ski jumping—but a balanced posture is critical here. Don’t overdo it; remember: fail fast, fail forward, and fail safe. And while there’s no doubt that companies that set themselves up to soar high started their “jump” with experimentation, there are way too many companies still stuck here (it’s one of the reasons we wrote this book). Next, you get more experience and assume a sort of AI-aerodynamic posture as you use some techniques to put your data to work using some form of model tuning (InstructLab, LoRA, etc.), multishot prompting, or using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pattern—we cover all of this in more detail in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_using_your_data_as_a_differentiator_1740182052172518">Chapter 8</a>. And then you hit it—the Value Tipping Point<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Value Tipping Point" data-type="indexterm" id="id564"/>.</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch04_figure_1_1740182047851247"><img alt="A graph of blue color  Description automatically generated with medium confidence" src="assets/aivc_0401.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 4-1. </span>Companies that move from +AI to AI+ often follow a similar path to value creation—the AI Value Creation Curve</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Unlike ski jumping, you have the option to turn back here, but why would you? You’ve got so much momentum at this point. Think about it: you’ve got wins under your belt, you understand GenAI and agentic capabilities, and you’ve got a good sense of the factors upon which to evaluate your AI platform: choice, efficiency, and transparency. And (hopefully) because you’ve read this book, you’ve tapped into open innovation (choice), and have large language models (LLMs) that are performant for the enterprise (efficiency) and safe for deployments (trusted). Quite simply, you can’t afford to turn back here. If you do, you will cheat your business and the opportunity to reach its fullest potential. You see, to the right of the Value Tipping Point in the AI Value Creation Curve is where momentum really builds, automation and digital labor become the catalyst to other efficiencies in code development, AI assistants truly shift costs left, and more.</p>

<p>It’s at the far-right of this ramp where you really take flight, and like an Olympic ski jumper, you’re now well positioned to increase lift and reduce drag. You’re agentic. Everything you’ve been working on has become part of your company’s operating model—you have agents, assistants, you’re leveraging your most valuable asset (your data), you’re shifting-left rote tasks in all roles from development to marketing, writing, and more. The far right of the AI Value Creation Curve<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI Value Creation Curve" data-type="indexterm" id="id565"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary=" +AI to AI+" data-primary-sortas="AI to AI transition for mental model" data-secondary="AI Value Creation Curve" data-type="indexterm" id="id566"/> is literally destination <span class="keep-together">AI+</span> reached.</p>

<p>And just like “The Eagle” on his ramp, you might not look like a world-class pro, at first. But once you take off, it’s all about soaring higher and farther<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_usecasescreationcurvefor41331" data-type="indexterm" id="id567"/>. What’s more, because you read our book, we’re confident your landing (and who says you have to land at all, we don’t think you do) will stick better than Eddie’s early jumps!</p>

<h1>Going Horizontal Gets You the Most Vertical</h1>

<p>Looking at <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_1_1740182047851247">Figure 4-1</a>, you might have noticed that the use cases (techniques) are not industry specific (vertical); rather they cut across all industries—in short, they are horizontal. We’re going to hit on this point a number of times because we think it’s critical to think horizontally<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="horizontal approach to" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_usecaseshorizontalapproachto426384"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="horizontal approach to use cases" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_horizontalapproachtousecases426384"/> before you think vertically when it comes to AI use cases. Let’s take a moment to look at (without any skiing analogies) the different stages of the AI Value Creation Curve.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Experimentation" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_experimentation_1740182047877772">
<h2>Experimentation</h2>

<p>For most, earlier AI projects<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="horizontal approach to use cases" data-secondary="experimentation" data-type="indexterm" id="id568"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="experimentation, horizontal approach to use cases" data-type="indexterm" id="id569"/> started with data science and machine learning. But because those techniques required deep skill and often extended data labeling efforts, some value was delivered, but not to the masses. In most cases, it was incremental value versus exponential value. Use cases were varied, with some being horizontal (data exploration, customer care, personalization in marketing, etc.) and others being industry specific (payment fraud, retail analytics, etc.). But as you learned in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_oh_to_be_an_ai_value_creator_1740182046162988">Chapter 2</a>, this era of AI never really scaled to deliver democratized value to the many—the opportunity that still awaits so many today.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">With the dawn of GenAI<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="generative AI (GenAI)" data-secondary="versus traditional AI" data-secondary-sortas="traditional AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id570"/>, a new cycle of experimentation started. Suddenly, exponential outcomes seemed more feasible, given the reduced effort in data preparation and labeling. Today, many are discovering that the right data, working with the right models, can lead to some exciting outcomes. Quite simply, it’s been way easier to experiment with GenAI than it was with traditional AI, and this is why most of those who have dabbled in GenAI picked some of it up early.</p>

<h2>Putting Your Data to Work</h2>

<p>Ironically, the greatest asset for GenAI across all businesses is the same: proprietary data<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="horizontal approach to use cases" data-secondary="data component" data-type="indexterm" id="id571"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data" data-secondary="in horizontal approach to use cases" data-secondary-sortas="horizontal approach to use cases" data-type="indexterm" id="id572"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="proprietary data" data-secondary="as asset across businesses" data-type="indexterm" id="id573"/>. As companies seek value generation from AI, the insight from each is similar: if we can unleash our proprietary data, we got a very real shot at exponential impact (we’ll really get into this in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_using_your_data_as_a_differentiator_1740182052172518">Chapter 8</a>).</p>

<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="ch04_the_llm_cheat_sheet_1740182047877884">
<h1>The LLM Cheat Sheet</h1>

<p>Augmenting an LLM<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="large language models (LLMs)" data-secondary="cheat sheet for using" data-type="indexterm" id="id574"/> with your knowledge is critical to get more trustworthy results. Assume you work in HR and are using an LLM to power an HR policy chatbot while also using it for written communication outreach. You have a corporate handbook that contains specifics around things like family leave, sick days, charitable giving, work-at-home policies, and more. An off-the-shelf LLM scraped on public internet data would have no idea about this, and you likely don’t want to publish your internal handbook on the internet. In this enterprise setting, augmenting your LLM with your data would yield many benefits and limit hallucinations (a topic we’ll detail in the next chapter; but LLMs often make things up as they go about their business—imagine telling someone they have 2 weeks of family leave when they get 26).</p>

<p>Putting your data to work is about injecting your data into the GenAI process (in a safe, trusted, and explainable way) to improve the results. RAG is one way to do this, and ironically, the words for this acronym perfectly describe what it does. In a RAG<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)" data-type="indexterm" id="id575"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)" data-type="indexterm" id="id576"/> pattern, an LLM <em>retrieves </em>data from your trusted source, which has the effect of <em>augmenting </em>that LLM’s knowledge (with information in a database or document), which should result in a better <em>generation</em>. Perhaps your HR team has a “Welcome to Parenthood” package that explains all the benefits your company gives employees when their family grows. You could get all the creativity and nonform letter writing abilities from your LLM, but the generated letter would be more likely to convey actual benefits your company gives to its employees. It’s kind of like giving your AI a cheat sheet of notes for it to check just before it gives a response (but it can still get stuff wrong—which we talk about in the next chapter).</p>

<h2 class="less_space">IT Automation</h2>

<p>We included the Value Tipping Point<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Value Tipping Point" data-type="indexterm" id="id577"/> demarcation<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="horizontal approach to use cases" data-secondary="IT automation" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_horizontalapproachtousecasesITautomation44361"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="IT automation" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_ITautomation44361"/> in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_1_1740182047851247">Figure 4-1</a> because it’s really the moment where companies don’t just <em>realize</em>, but they <em>believe</em> they can automate their technology and operations using AI and get a big payback from doing so. This is a great example of what we alluded to at the start of this chapter with respect to the horizontalness of AI use cases. Think about it for a moment, <em>any large company runs on technology, no matter the industry</em>.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>We originally wrote <em>any company</em> (as opposed to <em>any large company</em>), but it upset one of our mothers who’s a little nervous about AI taking over. She argued, “But my neighbor’s lemonade stand doesn’t use technology!” Oh really? Did Johnny and Sue next door squeeze those lemons with their bare hands? Fine, we’ll give you that. (Truthfully, when we all heard the story, we doubted those kids used real lemons at all, but we wanted to keep the magic alive.) “Where did the lemons come from?” the author asked. A grocery store that runs on inventory systems, track-and-trace for safety, and logistics software was the statement that followed. To which the cherished bundle of wisdom remarked, “What if they grew the lemons themselves; I had a lemon tree when I was a kid.” Impressive indeed. Did they check the weather forecast to know to open or not? Did they post anything relating to their refreshment offerings on TikTok? Heck, we’d bet for sure those kids took Venmo as a payment option. The discussion ended when the mom instantly became disinterested in the playful tug-of-words because a Netflix notification on her iPhone suggested she might like <em>The Lincoln Lawyer</em> because she rated two thumbs up for <em>The Law According to Lidia Poët</em>. (Finally, something we agree on—both great shows.) In short: we wrote <em>large</em> to appeal to one of our mothers, but we mean <em>any</em><em> business</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>Now think about how technology today mostly operates for companies, large or small. It’s mostly manual, supported by legions of technical employees, and in many cases, contractors and consultants. AI provides a baseline technology to automate significant portions of this work: system uptime, addressing critical vulnerabilities, certificate management, application operations, and many others.</p>

<p>This might give rise to the question, why now? Quite simply, large portions of technology management are repetitive tasks that need to be observed, operated, and managed. It turns out that AI is quite good at repetitive tasks, and, in many cases, it can even fix technology issues before they become issues at all. That is the ultimate promise of IT automation.</p>

<p>Consider the mundane task of certificate<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id578" id="id578-marker">2</a></sup> health. A centralized system to manage certificate health might seem like a simple task, but it’s a huge headache for many because certificates are scattered across distributed systems. A lack of centralized visibility and reliance on manual tracking leads to scattered certificate inventories, increasing the risk of forgotten and expired certificates. Certificates expire before clients know, which directly impacts dependent applications, resulting in a complete outage of a service. In fact, most certificate management tools fail because each tool only works with the certificates that they manage, and it’s very difficult to track back to certificates as a root cause of outages. The impact and scale of expired, outdated, or misconfigured certificates is massive and can lead to a lot of outages and risks, resulting in discontinuity of the business. Expired certificates also expose enterprises to security risks like man-in-the-middle attacks, which means that hackers can intercept sensitive information. This is a problem ripe for solving using AI.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is a good time to consider all the other things you take for granted that IT teams do beyond certificate management, like caching content delivery networks (CDNs), intrusion detection systems, and power management; the list goes on and on. To fully appreciate them (and the opportunity of AI to help), it’s imperative to understand how today’s business applications are no longer simple constructs. Instead, they are intricate ecosystems, built and managed using a myriad of tools and services deployed across diverse cloud and on-premises environments. AI can help you now, but you’ll simply have no choice in the future. Why do we say this? Try to wrap your head around this jaw-dropping stat an IDC<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id579" id="id579-marker">3</a></sup> analyst shared with us: there will be <em>more than </em>one billion new logical applications created by 2028! Although outside the scope of this book, this fact strongly suggests that CIOs need to take<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hybrid by design approach" data-type="indexterm" id="id580"/> a hybrid by design<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id581" id="id581-marker">4</a></sup> approach when it comes to their transformation. Think about it: GenAI and hybrid cloud are both all about the data. Data is hybrid in location and type. A hybrid mindset gets you the most out of your data, which lets you get the most out of your models. Together they act as business amplifiers and are prerequisites to advance digital transformation.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Quite simply, as you progress on IT automation, it optimizes technology costs. Did your company fall into the trap where public cloud wasn’t the no-brainer cost savings move they thought it would be? Use IT automation to operate those workloads in a lower cost environment. Application underutilized? Use IT automation to migrate unused capacity to a different application. The opportunities are limitless, which is why this is the tipping point of value creation.</p>

<p>IBM has an automation initiative<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Client Zero automation initiative" data-type="indexterm" id="id582"/> called “Client Zero”—a challenge from its CEO to deliver $3 billion<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id583" id="id583-marker">5</a></sup> of value to the company via productivity savings using AI and encapsulate those journeys into patterns for client benefit. It’s an incredible project because we deliver real results to our clients, backed by the message that we’ve successfully achieved this ourselves. But there is more: IBM surely faced failures, bumps, and scrapes, and those in turn have paved the way for its successes and growth with these projects. So, IBM also shares with clients its lessons learned (yes, even the hard ones) so clients can progress faster, with more confidence, and with fewer failures on their own journeys.</p>

<p>This book is not about IBM, nor do we have the space to get into all the projects that helped us meet our CEO’s challenge, but some stats from the IT automation project alone (there were AI projects for HR, sales, development, real estate site operations, and more) are worth noting here:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>80% of the top IT issues now addressed and contained by AI</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>+25 point net promoter score (NPS) increase in customer support</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>$165 million in annualized operational savings</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>66% reduction in spend of its TechZone demonstration platform</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>85% reduction in the time it takes to spin up a demonstration environment</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>45,000 automated resource actions per month</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>And more</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Take a moment to go over this list again. First, understand that all those numbers will be wildly out-of-date (on the conservative side) by the time you read this book. That’s an important point not to be forgotten because these “wins” keep paying off. Secondly, somewhere in this list is a pain point jumping out at you, and now you know you have access to a pattern to wrap your hands around it.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">We get it, automation feels boring. It’s not something your customers see directly, but they’ll appreciate it because you will be spending more time with them thinking about solving their problems, or about how to make your products or services better. From an internal perspective, you’ll become a hero to your employees. This authoring team was talking one day over breakfast about how easy it is to go to AskIT and get most of our IT problems resolved, or at least a ticket quickly opened and resolved with minimal effort.

<h2>Code—The Language of Computers</h2>

<p>AI is changing the creative process<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="horizontal approach to use cases" data-secondary="code aspect" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_horizontalapproachtousecasescodeaspect48349"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="software coding use case" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_softwarecodingusecase48349"/>, not just for writers and artists but for software developers, too. Because coding languages evolve, software developers are in constant demand to update applications to meet modern expectations. This is such a great use case that isn’t apparent to those outside of IT. Why? Because when most (not techies) think of language, they rightfully think of how humans communicate with each other (or even their pets). But if you recall back in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_oh_to_be_an_ai_value_creator_1740182046162988">Chapter 2</a>, we talked about how when you start to look at things—and perhaps squint a little bit—everything becomes a language. When you think of it this way, for sure coding is a language. Whether it’s COBOL, Java, Go, or Python—just like humans can be polyglot (speaking multiple languages), so too are computers and the programmer who talk to them. We as humans speak to computers using many different languages in the same way we speak to other humans using many different languages. In the end, as technology and operations become automated, talent can be shifted to more valuable activities—one of which will always be new development.</p>

<p>We know there is a raging debate between hardcore coders and junior ones on how valuable coding assistants<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="assistants" data-secondary="coding" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_assistantscoding484116"/> are. Truly, it’s all over the map. McKinsey<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id586" id="id586-marker">6</a></sup> notes that AI code assistants can save developers 35% to 45% of time during code generation (only 10% for highly complex tasks). But there are realists and detractors, too. For example, a team from Purdue University’s Department of Computer Science looked at 517 Stack Overflow questions and turned to ChatGPT<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-type="indexterm" id="id587"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenAI" data-secondary="ChatGPT" data-type="indexterm" id="id588"/> to answer them as a test of consistency, correctness, and conciseness of AI for this task. They found that 52%<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id589" id="id589-marker">7</a></sup> of ChatGPT answers to programming questions were wrong and 77% were verbose. What’s more, there are deific programmers (like Jason Hall of Pirate Software gaming fame) who note that while AI will generate code in a hurry, it takes way longer to debug this code compared to his human-generated code.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>The Purdue team also performed a linguistic analysis of 2,000 randomly selected ChatGPT answers and found they were “more formal and analytical” while portraying “less negative sentiment.” If you’ve ever used a public forum to get help with your programming problem, you’ll appreciate this. For those of you who don’t program, it seems to be a developer rite of passage to ask a “stupid” (to someone else) question, only to get roasted by someone who probably wrote assembly at age 15. Missed something in the now approaching 100 comments post? Prepare for a RTFM (in the circles we run, this means “read the full manual,” but we’ve been told of other definitions) with a mad emoji response. In other words, “no question is a dumb question” is not equally embraced in developer help forums.</p>
</div>

<p>We think you’ll find AI is going to be super helpful to developers, but it requires a reframe from how most of the world has approached AI coding assistants to date. First, we want to note that we think AI code generation will get better over time because technology advances over time. No question about that. That said, one key question to unlocking AI’s value in this space that we encourage everyone<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data quality" data-type="indexterm" id="id590"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="quality of data" data-type="indexterm" id="id591"/> to ask is, “What data was used to train the model you’re using to assist your programmers?” Was it a scrape of any code block on Reddit, Stack Overflow, GitHub, and other repositories? Did you get to see where the data came from? These are very important topics we discuss through this book, focusing on them in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05_live_die_buy_or_try_much_will_be_decided_by_ai_1740182048942635">Chapter 5</a>. After all, a lot of code we get from these resources presumably used to work but doesn’t work now. If you know, you know.</p>

<p>But what about models that are purpose-built with transparent data for the task at hand? For example, watsonx Code Assistant for Ansible Lightspeed<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Ansible Lightspeed" data-type="indexterm" id="id592"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="watsonx Code Assistant" data-secondary="Ansible Lightspeed" data-type="indexterm" id="id593"/> is purpose-built to only assist with the creation of Ansible playbooks in YAML. Its training data comes from literally hundreds of thousands of experiences from Red Hat<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Red Hat, and Ansible Lightspeed" data-type="indexterm" id="id594"/>—the primary developers behind Ansible with their enterprise-hardened Ansible Automation Platform offering. Think about the expertise and corpus a company like Red Hat has writing Ansible Playbooks when its day-in and day-out job is enterprise grade Ansible-assisted deployments. Add to that data from a moderated and open community (Ansible Galaxy), and you’ve got a pretty good set of labeled (it verifiably works) and explainable (you know where it came from) data to build a model to power a very capable AI code assistant for Ansible Playbook generation.</p>

<p>Thinking back to the IBM “Client Zero” initiative<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Client Zero automation initiative" data-type="indexterm" id="id595"/>, a big part of all those provisioning efficiencies was thanks to Ansible. Using watsonx Code Assistant for Ansible Lightspeed, playbook developers had a 70% acceptance rate on code suggestions. That’s huge! Put to work on just operating system patching alone, IBM realized a 93% decrease in time to patch systems. And now you know why those IT tickets are being solved faster, which created more shift-right think time that allows these tech teams to focus on more complex problems versus spending time on the mundane act of ensuring CVE-2022-0847 (the Dirty-Pipe Linux kernel issue) is patched across all servers.</p>

<p>There’s one more thing we’ll flesh out in <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ch07_where_this_technology_is_headed_one_model_will_not_1740182051667482">Chapter 7</a>, but worth pointing out now: the model used to support this coding assistant is 33 times smaller <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="small language models (SLMs)" data-secondary="advantages of" data-type="indexterm" id="id596"/>than some of the other models you’re likely familiar with when it comes to supporting AI-assisted code generation. A much more accurate and smaller model (which means no expensive GPUs to order, <em>and</em> you can run it on a laptop if you want) is something we think is going to play out more in the future when it comes to GenAI in general, as well as coding assistants.</p>

<p>So now that the ubiquitous code generation by AI banter is out of the way, there are more aspects to code development we want you to think about—coding isn’t just all about code generation. That same McKinsey study we cited also talked about GenAI coding assistants being used for code refactoring, code documentation, and code question and answering.</p>

<p>We’ve all worked in the IBM development labs at one time or another, and we’ve seen some amazing code that is not only well written, but just as importantly, well documented<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="documentation, code" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_documentationcode493187"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="code documentation" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_codedocumentation493187"/>. That said, we’ve also seen a lot of what we call <em>spaghetti</em><em><strong> </strong></em>code; it’s messy (still could be good code) and trying to figure it out is more painful than doing taxes. The truth of the matter is that keeping a well commented and structured codebase is hard to do for a multitude of reasons (labor turnover, contractors, retirement, stretch assignments—it’s the least important thing in the minds of many developers who think of themselves as the Mozarts of code). The irony is that the more complex a codebase is, the less documented it seems to get. Automating code summarization<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="automation" data-secondary="code summarization" data-type="indexterm" id="id597"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="code summarization" data-type="indexterm" id="id598"/> can free up a developer’s time to focus on higher-value tasks, and just like how GenAI could generate the first copy of a customer outreach message, so too can it generate initial documentation. Remember, this still requires a developer in the loop to verify it, but it shifts-left the work of the initial comments and lets coders transfer a lot of that thinking and typing time to designing and prototyping new features. What’s more, as you fine-tune your LLM, you get consistency and a set of standards around the writing style for these comments.</p>

<p>But there are also downstream benefits to well-documented code. LLMs let you talk to “things” like contracts, legislation, and, you guessed it, codebases. Imagine being a brand-new developer just hired and assigned to a new project, and you want to know how the <code>processOrder()</code> function works and which parts of the system it interacts with. Or perhaps where a certain code path is used elsewhere in the codebase. Simply ask an AI that fronts the codebase—this can greatly accelerate onboarding but still leverage the pair programming model.</p>

<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="ch04_pair_programming_in_the_age_of_genai_1740182047878066">
<h1>Pair Programming in the Age of GenAI</h1>

<p>The pair programming model<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pair programming model" data-type="indexterm" id="id599"/> is a collaborative software development practice that typically sits a junior (known as the <em>driver</em>—they write the code) with a senior developer (known as the <em>navigator</em>) who reviews the code as it is written and thinks critically in a big picture sort of way about the code in the overall application. Traditionally, they shared the same desk, but in a hybrid workforce, this isn’t as easy as it used to be. This approach<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id600" id="id600-marker">8</a></sup> is designed to enhance code quality, promote knowledge sharing, and improve collaboration. This model can be very taxing on a senior developer’s time, but the benefits are enormous. That’s a tough trade-off. What if an LLM encapsulated the knowledge of a senior developer and took on the role of a constant over-the-shoulder, full-time pair programmer to your new hire? The senior developer would still be accessible, meet weekly with the new hire, but AI would take over some of the constant observational aspects of the workflow. What’s more, this also enables a more modern work location strategy—recognizing that great programmers can be located anywhere—and may not be able to share a physical desk, or even the same desired work times in a hybrid work environment; this setup could help your junior programmer work wherever and whenever.</p>
</div></aside>

<p>There are other factors that have made code documentation such a big problem. In the whirlwind of sprints that is the Agile development world, developers are like caffeinated hamsters running on the infinite coder wheel, sprinting the nonstop cycle of code, test, ship...code, test, ship...again and again. And since no one will really read their documented code for months at best, it gets deprioritized. But good code <span class="keep-together">documentation</span> is a <em>must-have </em>for any development team. In fact, we think it plays a crucial role in software development. Sure, there is the obvious: it helps other <span class="keep-together">developers—who</span> might be part of its chain of custody—to update or review it. But it also fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing across teams. McKinsey found this to be the biggest area where AI can help—citing benefits in the 45% to 50% time reduction range. IBM has found lots of benefits in this space as well, but we’ll leave you with the suspense of the results until <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06_skills_that_thrill_1740182050334297">Chapter 6</a> where we talk about a solution that came from an IBM skills challenge. But wait, you may have thought you read that software development will be automated by AI. Indeed, there is AI value creation in code generation, code completion, and documentation creation, but that is not the entire job to be done. New development starts with a thesis: what applications will improve our business? Are we focused on customer retention? Revenue growth? Better customer service? How do we modernize our legacy applications?</p>

<p>These thought processes cannot be done by AI, but the creation of solutions to address these can certainly be augmented with AI. For example, many companies depend on transactional systems to run their business and want to modernize (or at least understand) the critical parts of their codebase that keeps their business running. AI can be utilized to discover and understand older code that wasn’t well documented; but it’s even more likely the case that no one has any idea how the code that is running the most critical part of your business even works! As we talked about in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03_equations_for_generative_ai_persuasion_1740182046765298">Chapter 3</a>, this enterprise amnesia, confounded by the up and coming Silver Tsunami, is a big challenge facing many companies today.</p>

<p>You have to understand your monolithic apps to do anything with them, so any modernization project must start off by detangling enterprise amnesia. That’s a major AI use case that has nothing to do with actual code writing but has everything to do with your code. It’s been said that a picture is worth a thousand words, so we hand-sketched (we’re better at AI than we are at art) how AI can help in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_2_1740182047851284">Figure 4-2</a>.</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch04_figure_2_1740182047851284"><img alt="A drawing of a person holding a string  Description automatically generated" src="assets/aivc_0402.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 4-2. </span>Detangling enterprise amnesia</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>The far left of <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_2_1740182047851284">Figure 4-2</a> represents a position many are in today: lots of mystery code that is not all that dissimilar to a ball of yarn wrapped into a tangled mess. IBM saw (and solved) this very problem for many of its mainframe clients who have large monolithic apps with interdependent features that have been repeatedly updated over the years. You can imagine similar messiness in other frameworks. For example, in Java, Hibernate, Spring, and Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) all have their own “balls of yarn.”</p>

<p>No matter what technology stack you run, if you’re a large company with millions of lines of code, hundreds of dependencies, and dated documentation, your developers can spend weeks or months trying to understand all the changes needed to modernize a block of code just so it can be refactored (and potentially migrated) to scale for a hybrid cloud environment. And after all that work, there are no guarantees their updates won’t break something because of bad code, or because they missed <span class="keep-together">something</span>.</p>

<p>The good news is that AI can be put to work here as well. For example, a lot of large companies still rely on COBOL code<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="COBOL" data-type="indexterm" id="id601"/> to run their business. That codebase runs solid, but clients that want to change something or modernize parts of it feel like they’re playing with a Jenga puzzle—except that pulling the wrong piece will tumble the business as opposed to a bunch of wooden blocks. AI is helping these clients discover and identify the code, what it does, how it’s connected, and more. In fact, IBM created an AI-powered tool for this very purpose, called Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence (ADDI). As illustrated in the middle of <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_2_1740182047851284">Figure 4-2</a>, ADDI is an analysis tool that helps you visualize applications, data, and jobs on the mainframe. ADDI enables architects and developers to discover dependencies in a click, make changes with confidence, and keep documentation current and accurate. When you think about it, ADDI is like the ultimate yarn-unraveling tool for developers that helps them reverse enterprise amnesia. It operates like a curious cat pawing through a ball of yarn and works relentlessly to analyze applications and map out their dependencies; in short, it untangles the chaos and turns it into something that makes sense. By the time you get to the far right of <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_2_1740182047851284">Figure 4-2</a>, you’ve got full application understanding (thanks to generated metadata) that you can hold up to your bosses like a trophy (just watch out for the cat that might want its yarn back).</p>

<p>What’s the label on the trophy you won thanks to AI? Confidence! You can now look at pieces of that Jenga puzzle in different ways. Perhaps you’re focusing on an area of the app you want to modernize for a different engagement method—now you have insights into what would happen if something should go wrong with that code block or what other parts of the business depend on it. Perhaps you have a ton of impending retirements and your mission is to ensure no code becomes exposed with their absence, so your focus is on mitigating this risk by upskilling someone to take over that codepath and planning your modernization journey on that code block be left for another later time, if at all. In reality, it’s typically a mix of everything. Some code you’ll want to leave in place and some you’ll want to modernize for a variety of <span class="keep-together">reasons</span>.</p>

<p>Contrast this to how some clients are approaching (because vendors told them) using GenAI to modernize their COBOL code. First, they skip past the important part: understanding. That creates unnecessary risk—imagine renovating your house without the architecture drawings to understand how it was framed and its support structure! We’ve heard of some clients grabbing a ubiquitous AI code assistant to pick up some COBOL copy books or code snippets and migrate them to Java. Step back for a moment and ask yourself how many high-quality COBOL/JAVA code pairs<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id602" id="id602-marker">9</a></sup> are sitting out there ready to be scraped (without or without permission). The answer: not very many. As it turned out, many of these clients ended up with “JOBOL”—shoddy code that didn’t quite work, was poorly documented, was hard to modify, and any repairs that don’t break it took longer to do<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_documentationcode493187" data-type="indexterm" id="id603"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_codedocumentation493187" data-type="indexterm" id="id604"/>.</p>

<p>And just like it did with Ansible, IBM created watsonx<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="watsonx Code Assistant" data-secondary="IBM Z" data-type="indexterm" id="id605"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="IBM Z" data-type="indexterm" id="id606"/> Code Assistant for IBM Z to support mainframe application modernization<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="mainframe application modernization" data-type="indexterm" id="id607"/>. But this product isn’t just about code migration. ADDI was built to accommodate the full code development lifecycle (Understand, Refactor, Transform, Validate, Recommend, Observe). This product has built-in automations that take understanding (metadata), then identify mix-and-match business services to extract and refactor the code—after all of this, it’s finally time to migrate the code. See the difference? Ironically, and a great testament to the product managers who designed this product and truly understood their clients’ needs, many clients use this product for the discovery and understanding feature alone!</p>

<p>How does this solution achieve such effective AI-driven app modernization and discovery on the mainframe while others struggle with poor performance? Think about it. IBM has programmers bilingual in COBOL and Java who have created thousands of pairs of functionally equivalent programs for the mainframe using both languages. Specifically, watsonx Code Assistant for IBM Z was trained on thousands of pairs of real enterprise programs in COBOL and Java to create high-quality JOBOL-free code.</p>

<p>AI for code is just scratching the surface. In the end, we like to think that AI code assistants are like what Porsche had in mind when it introduced its Tiptronic transmission back in 1990 (which has since evolved to PDK: Porsche Doppelkupplung). Basically, this transmission gave drivers the thrill of driving standard/manual if they wanted to, the convenience of driving automatic, or somewhere in between (and with safety: if you’re driving this car manually and made a shifting mistake that would damage the car, the automation would stop that from happening). We think this analogy is great. Are you a novice programmer and want to get started? Here’s some code. Are you an expert programmer who writes such clean code you can literally hear it squeak on the pull request to merge your code into the main branch? Great, have it generate the easy stuff or just document that divine-tier code you just wrote. Are you brand new to a company and just want to ask an AI about the code? Have at it. Or maybe you’re an experienced programmer, but you’ve been given a piece of ancient, business-critical code (we’re looking at <em>you</em>, payroll system) and you’re not sure what will break when you migrate that from COBOL to Java. Regardless, think of these assistants as more than just code writers and use them like a Porsche transmission. One thing we’re sure of, GenAI is going to reshape the developer experience<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_horizontalapproachtousecasescodeaspect48349" data-type="indexterm" id="id608"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_softwarecodingusecase48349" data-type="indexterm" id="id609"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_assistantscoding484116" data-type="indexterm" id="id610"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Digital Labor and AI Assistants" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_digital_labor_and_ai_assistants_1740182047878124">
<h2>Digital Labor and AI Assistants</h2>

<p>Most people would love to hire an assistant<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="horizontal approach to use cases" data-secondary="assistants as digital labor" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_horizontalapproachtousecasesassistantsasdigitallabor411757"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="assistants" data-secondary="as digital labor" data-secondary-sortas="digital labor" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_assistantsasdigitallabor411757"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="digital labor" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_digitallabor411757"/>: someone to do the tasks they do not want to do, are repetitive in nature, or are maybe just too difficult. The problem is that hiring another person is too expensive. Enter the world of digital labor.</p>

<p>In the past, the term “digital worker” described a human employee with digital skills. Today, when you use this word, its definition resolves to a category of software robots (not the ones you see in movies, they’re coming, but not quite here yet), which are trained to perform specific tasks or processes in partnership with their human <span class="keep-together">colleagues—often</span> referred to as bots. We define digital labor as software-based labor that can independently execute meaningful parts of complex, end-to-end processes using a range of skills.</p>

<p>Digital labor can leverage AI to execute a sequence of tasks within a given workflow. Specifically, digital employees<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="digital employees (bots)" data-type="indexterm" id="id611"/> (the bots) leverage AI capabilities such as natural language processing, agents, and GenAI (among others) to interact and communicate, think and reason, sequence skills on the fly, and put those skills into context by maintaining a working memory of past interactions. Knowledge workers (us humans) can then instruct, train, and delegate work to these digital employees. These delegations can range from automating and speeding up simple tasks, helping with more complex decision making. For example, a digital accounts payable worker may be able to autonomously perform parts of four traditional job roles—customer service representative, billing agent, cash applicator, and dispute resolver—to complete an order to cash (OTC) process. Because digital workers increase the bandwidth of their human bosses, they have largely been adopted through digital transformation efforts (shift left), allowing companies to reallocate their workforce to more strategic tasks (shift right).</p>

<p>You’ve definitely experienced the highs and lows of a chatbot—some are brilliant and can actually do things like a human without the hold time (the good), others can’t seem to do much of anything outside two or three tasks (the bad), and others are so useless they feel like navigating an endless phone menu only to hear, “Sorry, we’re closed” (the ugly).</p>

<p>In a day and age where instant gratification has become the expectation, consumers (and to be honest, your employees) demand responses to their questions and concerns quickly, if not immediately. Businesses know that excellent customer service<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="customer service, and digital labor use" data-type="indexterm" id="id612"/> is vital to their long-term success. Luckily, technology is evolving with the times, and the digital revolution and AI are helping to completely reimagine call centers with digital labor.</p>

<p>An AI assistant powered with digital labor<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="shifting left" data-secondary="AI assistants as digital labor" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_shiftingleftAIassistantsasdigitallabor412256"/> is one heck of a horizontal use case, because what business doesn’t have a frontend to their clients or employees (if they don’t, they should). Why so compelling? Remember what we shared earlier: if a human employee picks up a phone to handle a call, that’s typically going to cost about $5 for a simple case; if a digital employee handles that call, it’s about $0.25.</p>

<p>For example, the Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Oregon DMV, digital labor example" data-type="indexterm" id="id613"/> stood up some digital labor to help them handle the massive call volume spikes they experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Within weeks, they were deflecting about 30%<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id614" id="id614-marker">10</a></sup> of the basic questions they received. These digital employees freed up time for human employees to handle more complex calls and helped reduce wait times. The Oregon DMV noted that this effort saved them almost $3 million (the 2-year cost of about 30 workers) and reduced customer wait times. Wow!</p>

<p>Another pandemic shift-left moment was with CVS<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="CVS, digital labor example" data-type="indexterm" id="id615"/>, a leading US health solutions company. While it offers multiple channels to healthcare, like insurance and wellness resources, it is likely best known as a pharmacy. Before the pandemic, CVS had 40,000 or so stores and averaged about 150,000 calls a day. Just like the Oregon DMV, COVID pushed its call volumes through the roof. CVS put to work a digital labor force to help handle millions and millions of calls using AI. With significant double-digit deflection rates, CVS modernized to handle over four times the call volume as before, saving an eye-popping amount of money per day.</p>

<p>We share these two examples with you not just because we’re so familiar with them (they were built with IBM technology), but because they showcase that you can work for a smaller government agency or a super large company, or anywhere in between, and get digital labor to work for you. And because they are a pandemic-era reference, it tells you that these AI benefits have been available to you for for some time. Agents will take solutions like this to the next level. The question now becomes: what is your company currently doing?</p>

<p>Camping World<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Camping World, digital labor example" data-type="indexterm" id="id616"/> is a US-based company that sells recreational vehicles (RVs) and RV parts. It wanted to create more free time for its agents to build meaningful and impactful conversations with their clients. That meant removing from the live human agent queue basic, quick, and simple queries that could be answered faster with automation. Camping World put some IBM digital labor technology to work, and its human workers ended up with double-digit efficiency gains, while hold times for its customers to talk to someone on a phone when a human was actually needed to assist with the problem at hand dropped to just 33 seconds! While that left customers with no time to contemplate life (they can catch up while camping), it did make them happier, as Camping World’s engagement scores jumped up by 40%.</p>

<p>Another example is Sport Clips<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Sport Clips, digital labor example" data-type="indexterm" id="id617"/> haircuts. It takes a unique approach for haircuts: the shops have TVs everywhere, playing every kind of sport you can imagine while you get your hair cut in an MVP style. Sport Clips has a massive franchise expansion plan, which includes growing staff by a whopping 30% to meet its business growth targets. The company shared with us a challenge: where can our franchisees find the people they need to staff their stores and deliver that championship haircut experience? The Sport Clips franchise team wanted to give their franchisees peace of mind that when they come on board, they’ll be able to find staff who could tackle unruly hair like an NFL linebacker and make every cut count. In short, Sport Clips needed to give its franchisees the tools they needed to get their franchises going. The Sport Clips team used watsonx Orchestrate to create digital labor workers and reduced the process for candidate outreach from three hours to three minutes.</p>

<p>Obviously, you don’t need IBM technology to make this all happen. Don’t get us wrong: we’d be happy if you did, and we truly believe IBM’s GenAI platform addresses all the things you need to be thinking about. But as a non-IBM example<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Klarna" data-type="indexterm" id="id618"/>, Klarna<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id619" id="id619-marker">11</a></sup> announced in early 2024 that it partnered with an IBM competitor to put digital labor to work for its customer service team; today, AI handles two-thirds of the calls (a rate similar to CVS), which led to a 25% reduction in repeat inquiries, and does the work equivalent of 700 full-time agents, allowing staff to focus on higher-order tasks. That’s a lot of people shifting right!</p>

<p>See the pattern? From hiring hair cutters, to RV camping, to getting information on a prescription, to getting your license to drive that RV—and all parts in between—digital labor can help any business, for almost any task, for any industry. This is why we are so adamant about a horizontal mindset with GenAI use cases. Every company can use some help hiring, servicing its customers, dispensing information, and more. It’s also why we told you to break down your business processes into their lowest common denominators with our Dimension One use case tip back in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_ai_to_ai_generative_ai_and_the_netscape_moment_1740182043982974">Chapter 1</a>—because it gives you supreme clarity over where digital employees can be created to help human workers in a workflow and get you to AI+<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_shiftingleftAIassistantsasdigitallabor412256" data-type="indexterm" id="id620"/>.</p>

<p>Imagine if every person in your organization was augmented by 10 digital workers. In fact, there’s no reason to stop at 10; it could be 100. In <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_ai_to_ai_generative_ai_and_the_netscape_moment_1740182043982974">Chapter 1</a>, we said shift left so you can shift right. This is about building automation early in the workflow or “job to be done.” AI is exceptional at this, if we take the time to explain to an AI what we want done. Said another way, this is the construction of a digital worker.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>For sure, the discussion of job security<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job security, and digital labor" data-type="indexterm" id="id621"/> comes up whenever we talk about digital labor. Allow us to share with you our reframe. Start with the facts we laid out in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03_equations_for_generative_ai_persuasion_1740182046765298">Chapter 3</a>: most of the world is facing declining populations (future or current labor shortages) and declining rates of productivity. Ask yourself: what if the Great Resignation was really the Great Upgrade—a chance to attract and keep employees by making better use of their skills? Wouldn’t digital labor make this possible by picking up the grunt work for your employees? By collaborating with AI, you can relieve your employees from tedious, low-value tasks, allowing them to focus on the work they were hired to do. Instead of <em>replacing</em> employees, it puts them in charge. And instead of inflating costs, it optimizes your budget. This is why we think AI’s biggest value will be hiring avoidance for nonvalue creation roles and creating compelling attractiveness of your company as a place to work<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_horizontalapproachtousecasesassistantsasdigitallabor411757" data-type="indexterm" id="id622"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_assistantsasdigitallabor411757" data-type="indexterm" id="id623"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_digitallabor411757" data-type="indexterm" id="id624"/>.</p>

<p>You likely picked up on this intuition in the last section, but agents<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="horizontal approach to use cases" data-secondary="agent role in" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_horizontalapproachtousecasesagentrolein413720"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="agentic systems" data-secondary="horizontal approach to use cases" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_agenticsystemshorizontalapproachtousecases413720"/> are the next level of productivity for a business. An AI agent refers to a system or program that is capable of performing tasks by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools (like the ability to scrape a website, run some Python code, run SQL queries, get the weather, and more). Quite simply, agents expand the set of work that can be done with your GenAI transformation because they don’t just synthesize information, they can also come up with their own plan to solve a given task, execute actions, and remember things! The right LLM within an agentic workflow creates magic because agents can act autonomously, iteratively loop over problem domains, adapt, reason, and more. We really delve into agents in <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ch07_where_this_technology_is_headed_one_model_will_not_1740182051667482">Chapter 7</a>, so in this section we share just a few use cases.</p>

<p>We talked about the impressive results of digital labor on creating a frictionless customer experience in the previous part of our AI ramp, but AI agents can take all this to the next level. AI agents can be integrated into websites and apps to enhance the experience by powering up virtual assistants with even more capabilities. For example, perhaps you want to experience a specific sport in a specific location for that perfect vacation<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sports vacation use case, AI agent’s role" data-type="indexterm" id="id625"/>. That’s a request that requires more than just giving a booking site some dates. An agent could literally build an itinerary (places to see, things to do, what to eat) alongside the best time to go to maximize your chances of the perfect weather for your sport while minimizing tourism density, kickstart the visa process, and even book tickets and make reservations at that great restaurant only locals know about.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">What if you run a government agency that helps graduates of a federal upskilling program find new jobs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="upskilling" data-secondary="agent’s job finding role" data-type="indexterm" id="id626"/>. An agent could examine a job that a candidate applied to, understand that candidate (are they from a discouraged worker cohort ready to try again, perhaps just finished military duty, or maybe they’ve not interviewed in a long time because they had a long tenure at a company that recently went out of business), research the company posting the job on the internet, and generate simulated interviews! Step back and think about the benefits here. Not only would a candidate be better prepared for their interview (you never get a second chance to make a first impression), but they would likely perform better because their anxiety levels would be lower after multiple iterations with a digital interviewer. This could further get amped-up with an actual voice and avatar that can work in multiple languages, helping English as a second language (ESL) candidates work on other aspects of their delivery. The possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>Or consider an emergency response to a natural disaster<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="emergency response to natural disaster, agentic workflow" data-type="indexterm" id="id627"/>. An agentic AI workflow could use an LLM and tools (such as real-time traffic reports, location of severity detail or distress-related social media posts, weather, etc.) to retrieve information of potential distress calls from people likely to be near the most damaged areas via their social media posts. The locations of these users could be mapped and combined with weather reports, traffic, hospital loads, and other attributes to assist rescue services in saving more people in less time.</p>

<p>Agents can also be put to work for developers<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="code developers, AI agent’s role in supporting" data-type="indexterm" id="id628"/> by automatically creating a test unit to run their code in an enclave, analyzing the log output, generating feedback on the code and the test run, and perhaps even include some code enhancement tips for good measure. Sure, this could mostly be done asynchronously using a good GenAI-infused coding assistant and linter. But that’s a very iterative process, and there would be no enterprise knowledge gained and applied to others writing similar code to evolve (or instantiate) a company’s best practices. (Did we mention that agents can learn over time? More on that in <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ch07_where_this_technology_is_headed_one_model_will_not_1740182051667482">Chapter 7</a>.)</p>

<p>If you follow the advice in this book, this is where you are literally flying because you’re building your whole AI strategy with models that you trust, are explainable, and steered with your data—agents then inject massive scale into your GenAI efforts to get even more work done for you. Finally, it’s worth noting that the fact that since agents<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="agentic systems" data-secondary="autonomy of agents in" data-type="indexterm" id="id629"/> can act autonomously, it means they require <em>even more</em> observability and oversight, and this is why we’ve outlined (and will further elaborate later) in this book why you need solid governance over your AI<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_horizontalapproachtousecasesagentrolein413720" data-type="indexterm" id="id630"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_agenticsystemshorizontalapproachtousecases413720" data-type="indexterm" id="id631"/>.</p>

<h2 class="less_space">The Business Lens: Use Cases—Horizontally Speaking</h2>

<p>As we shift to a business lens<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="horizontal approach to use cases" data-secondary="business lens applied" data-type="indexterm" id="id632"/>, the nature of the use cases change. You’ve likely picked up on it in the last section, but in our work, there are three undeniable top AI use cases. Let’s call them “The Big 3”:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Customer care</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Code</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Digital labor</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_ai_to_ai_generative_ai_and_the_netscape_moment_1740182043982974">Chapter 1</a>, we talked about spending money to save money, and spending money to make it as one form of use case classification. No doubt, that would sound just as great in a TED talk as it does in this book, but now it’s time to take that slogan your executive team will love and put it into actual work. If you’re getting started, The Big 3 are the ones to attach to that framework.</p>

<p>Once a business has addressed The Big 3, think about where else AI can go to work and the vast array of use cases that can be explored in any one of these functional areas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Technology operations</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Supply chain</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Procurement</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Finance</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Human resources</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Marketing</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Legal</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>We believe that 90% of the value generation over the next decade will be in or around one of these 10 areas (the Big 3 and the 7 functional areas above).</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="The Bonus (Horizontal) Use Case—Synthetic Data" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_the_bonus_horizontal_use_case_synthetic_data_1740182047878295">
<h2>The Bonus (Horizontal) Use Case—Synthetic Data</h2>

<p>There’s been lots of talk about the demand for expensive GPUs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="horizontal approach to use cases" data-secondary="synthetic data" data-type="indexterm" id="id633"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="synthetic data" data-type="indexterm" id="id634"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="large language models (LLMs)" data-secondary="synthetic data and data drought solution" data-type="indexterm" id="id635"/> to build more capable LLMs, but one area that doesn’t get the attention it deserves is something<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data drought" data-type="indexterm" id="id636"/> we call the <em>data dr</em><em>o</em><em>ught</em>. Since most of the internet has been compressed into a typical LLM, there’s very little data to lead to more breakthrough (remember, LLMs love data). Let’s put that aside and talk about a kind of data drought that really hits home: assume you’re a credit card company trying to put GenAI to work to prevent fraud. You likely have loads of transaction data, but how much fraud data do you have? Sure, you have some fraud data. Is 50% of your data fraud data? If it were, you’d likely be out of <span class="keep-together">business</span>. What about data that falls under the domain of personally identifiable <span class="keep-together">information</span> (PII) or something similar? How much easier would it be to steer a model with data that is semantically like your data but is made up—that would eliminate all kinds of privacy issues. And as Simon &amp; Garfunkel insinuated in their hit “Fakin’ It,” the answer to data drought is synthetic data—in other words, fake it until you make it. Synthetic data is data that has been created artificially to replace (perhaps because of privacy) or supplement (add to, because there’s not enough of it) real-world data. This new data can be used as a placeholder for test datasets and is more frequently being used for the training of models because of its benefit to data privacy.</p>

<p>Synthetic data can also be used in healthcare<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="healthcare use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id637"/> to protect patient data and enhance clinical trials while satisfying compliance regulations. Other examples include simulated compliance testing exercise generation for auditors, placebo data production, risk modeling to stress test potential financial scenarios, crash testing, census simulations, and more.</p>

<p>While the data is artificial, synthetic data reflects real-world events on a mathematical and statistical basis. This technique is gaining in popularity. In fact, Gartner predicted that by the end of 2024, 60% of the data used in training AI models was synthetically generated.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id638" id="id638-marker">12</a></sup> A lot has changed since that Gartner prediction came out, including the release of ChatGPT and the Netscape moment that is GenAI. And while we don’t know what the exact percentage is, we know this—whatever that number ended up being, it’s going to get bigger every year moving forward (which is why we detail how synthetic data is critically important to the training of LLMs in <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ch07_where_this_technology_is_headed_one_model_will_not_1740182051667482">Chapter 7</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, just as real data in models can reflect biases, synthetically generating data that mimics natural data raises similar concerns that must be addressed.</p>

<p>As we enter this make-believe data world, one thing is clear: this use case may not draw the party people to you, but it’s definitely <em>hot</em>, <em>hot</em>, <em>hot</em> and finding a way to balance synthetic data with real-world information will shape the very fabric of GenAI use cases in the future<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_usecaseshorizontalapproachto426384" data-type="indexterm" id="id639"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_horizontalapproachtousecases426384" data-type="indexterm" id="id640"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="A Smattering of Use Cases—Vertically Speaking" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch04_a_smattering_of_use_cases_vertically_speaking_1740182047878363">
<h1>A Smattering of Use Cases—Vertically Speaking</h1>

<p>We didn’t allude to this; we’ve strongly stated it, but we’ll do it again: many GenAI and agentic use cases boil down to horizontalness. This point of view will give you a strong base for AI use case selection. After all, AI identifying the attenuation changes of a mole to identify the risk of a melanoma skin cancer works <em>exactly </em>the same way it does when put to work determining the porosity or pitting in material properties at the end of a manufacturing line’s build. See? There are two use cases across two industries (healthcare and manufacturing) that are the same from a technology <span class="keep-together">perspective</span>.</p>

<p>That said, once you’ve got your mindset wrapped around what AI can do for any industry (the horizontal), you’ll want to rotate it 90 degrees and vertically frame it to <em>your</em> industry. After all, convincing your executive team to put AI in delivery vehicles to create dynamic operator attention scores (an inverse measure of distracted driving) to reduce insurance premiums by talking about how AI can identify a warty potato on the wash line may not land the way you want it to. (Just for the record, now we’ve given you four industry cases using the same horizontal AI technique.)</p>

<p>In this section, we delve into some industries and give you detailed examples and a list (without explanation) of a bunch of AI use cases that you can explore on your own. While we refer to these industries as vertical, indeed you can view them as roles in some cases. For example, a hospital network will have accounting and legal representation just like many companies do. This is why we recommend reading all of the use cases, even if they aren’t directly related to your industry. Most importantly, remember what we told you at the start of this chapter—use cases are but a search away.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Agriculture" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_agriculture_1740182047878424">
<h2>Agriculture</h2>

<p>Farming is a labor-heavy industry<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="agriculture" data-type="indexterm" id="id641"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="agriculture use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id642"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="farming use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id643"/>, but it’s also rich with technology—from satellite-driven harvesters to insights from the stock market that optimize picking times. Automating key aspects will continue to bring innovations to improve crop yields, field health, and make the industry as a whole less subject to high-risk variables of water and pests, among other things.</p>

<p>AI can help in a lot of places. For example, our world is drowning in pesticides because we often rely on a “spray-and-pray” method to contain pests, pathogens, or diseases that can wipe out crops. It turns out that AI can make on-the-ground farming equipment smarter and less wasteful. AI-assisted precision spraying helps farmers target specific parts of a plant that need treatment for particular threats. This approach significantly reduces the reliance on broad-spectrum weed killers that destroy everything in their path. The AI pivots “spray-and-pray” to “see-and-spray.” Even the composition of the fertilizer or pesticide can be highly customized based on the soil composition or threat assessment. In one solution, AI can identify 26 crop-specific diseases (such as cedar apple rust and other related rust fungi) and in just 0.2 seconds, spray a control substance on the threat area with accuracy up to a quarter inch. In fact, real AI-powered lettuce bots already help harvest over 10% of the US lettuce supply in this very manner and have reduced pesticide use for their yields by up to 90%!</p>

<p>Other AI use cases you might want to search for include (but are not limited to) animal husbandry (shout-out to Lowica for their AI-based laser therapy for horses), autonomous harvesting, agronomics,<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id644" id="id644-marker">13</a></sup> crop rotation, drone spy vegetation patterns, harvest safety, transparency and traceability, livestock assessment, behaviors, wearables, intelligent irrigation, mental health crisis interventions,<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id645" id="id645-marker">14</a></sup> produce quality detection, produce sorting and washing, safer monocropping, seed engineering or field placement, seed mixing, soil fertility prediction, spend management, sustainable productivity, weather prediction, and more!</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Accounting" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_accounting_1740182047878474">
<h2>Accounting</h2>

<p>Technology is drastically changing the world of all professional services<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="accounting" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_usecasesaccounting420787"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="accounting use case" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_accountingusecase420787"/>, and accounting is one area where things are set to change drastically. To be blunt, GenAI and agents will transform the way tax and accounting professionals do their work and will push this profession further and further away from preparatory services (which will be greatly automated by AI) to more consultative and auditory services. If you’re an accountant, this is good news. First, your jobs aren’t going away—after all, the calculator didn’t end your profession—imagine an accountant working without a calculator! You’re about to go through a major uplift of your earning potential <em>if </em>you follow the journey we outline in <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06_skills_that_thrill_1740182050334297">Chapter 6</a>. This will help you break free of the bean-counting stereotype—you’ll be like the chef who stops peeling potatoes and starts designing Michelin Star menus.</p>

<p>Preparatory services, traditionally the hallmark of accountants, are increasingly being commoditized, which in turn drives down hourly billing rates for these services. As AI takes on more of the workload, the once-accepted (and still practiced by lawyers) approach of having interns perform tasks at slightly discounted partner rates is losing its appeal. But accountants have long been the trusted reporters and control stewards of financials—so who better to lead your AI governance practice and advise with financial expertise where AI can go to work for any business unit? Who better to help attach true ROI potentials to proposed use cases? Indeed, with preparatory services shifted left, accountants can spend more time on helping the business think about, well, the business. It’s not only accountants who work with money and numbers that are impacted here. This profession has close cousins in those who work in treasury management, auditing, bills payable, order-to-cash optimizations, or loan risk assessments. These domains encompass several financial processes that help to optimize and control a business’s cash flow, liquidity, funding, and keep it compliant.</p>

<p>For example, AI can help accountants better evaluate and prioritize the key factors in a pro forma (bean counter talk for a projected financial statement) to report on and influence predicted financial outcomes. By consulting leadership on these insights, businesses can make data-driven decisions to optimize their financial models and improve forecasting accuracy. This same use case also helps treasury personnel. According to the Treasury Today Group, only about 20% of companies can reliably forecast their cash position beyond a month; beyond three months, that number drops to about 5%.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id646" id="id646-marker">15</a></sup> AI can help these businesses minimize excess liquidity and make use of any surplus in multiple ways (investment, capital expenditures, and so on).</p>

<p>Other searchable AI use cases for this profession include (but are not limited to) automated compliance review, account receivables, cash flow liquidity funding and visibility nowcasting, counterparty risk, complex tax explanation for nonaccountants, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) compliance, fraud prevention and protection, financial report generation, liquidity management or optimization, operational or reputational risk management, simulated compliance testing exercises for auditors, spend management, tax gap analysis, tax code change impact analysis and distillation, and more<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_usecasesaccounting420787" data-type="indexterm" id="id647"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_accountingusecase420787" data-type="indexterm" id="id648"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Education" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_education_1740182047878527">
<h2>Education</h2>

<p>Of all industries, educational institutions<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="education" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_usecaseseducation421457"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="education use case" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_educationusecase421457"/> might be facing the biggest disruption from AI—we’re talking in the same tier as ride-sharing and the taxi industry. Educators need to redefine what it means to learn, assess, and grow in environments where students can use AI to do so much of their heavy lifting. Think about it: how do you give a coding assignment to a student when they can use an LLM to write it? What about an essay?</p>

<p>This is a very controversial space right now, and our regret is the variance of opinions on the use of GenAI and agents in the classroom. To put it plainly, it’s not an “if it should be used” discussion. Many had the same debate about calculators. It’s time.</p>

<p>There are great creative use cases on how to bring AI into the classroom. For example, what if a team had an AI come up with a three-page summary of a topic, but students got together to “punch up” the language? After all, this is what lawyers are doing today—wouldn’t that be teaching them what the future of work looks like? What about critiquing what the AI wrote? Having to cite and check references for veracity (this would teach students how to use AI properly because of its tendency to hallucinate). Teachers could also reimagine lesson plans where AI can help. How about using an LLM to create challenging role-play conversation? Students could have a debate with an AI that has taken on the persona of a historical figure and “time travel” to debate them. As students, we would have found it interesting to talk to a former Canadian prime minister who, in 1863, after throwing up during a debate (he was drunk!) remarked, “I get sick sometimes not because of drink or any other causes, except that I am forced to listen to the ranting of my honorable opponent.” Perhaps not with the historical figure in the example we gave, but imagine fronting such an engagement with an AI-generated person in their likeness, with voice and all. The point is that educators can use LLMs to engage learners and shift the focus to the art of critical thinking as opposed to memorization of facts. To put it plainly, the genie’s out of the bottle, and if some educators keep marching to the beat of their own drum, they’re likely to fall off the real beat and end up shortchanging the very people they’re trying to help. There’s common ground to be found here—and it needs to happen fast and be aligned with the world that students are actually stepping into.</p>

<p>One thing we know for sure: there needs to be an upskill<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="upskilling" data-secondary="for educators to find quality uses for AI" data-secondary-sortas="educators to find quality uses for AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id649"/> for educators so they don’t run away <em>from</em>, but run <em>to</em>, incorporating AI into the classroom. Ironically, AI has countless ways to help teachers, from reducing the burden of assessment and lesson planning, to managing skyrocketing student-to-teacher ratios and more.</p>

<p>This is why we wrote <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06_skills_that_thrill_1740182050334297">Chapter 6</a>, which is all about skilling. This isn’t going to be easy. Shift-right moments in education are rare. But you can’t prepare kids for the jobs of tomorrow if you don’t know anything about the skills of tomorrow. Quite honestly, the future of education will be less and less about preparing students for a specific job. We think it will be about preparing them for the “everythings and anythings” that the future holds. Like it or not, students will graduate into a world full of AI and they’ll need to know their way around these tools, understanding their options and cautions.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>We find the testing of fact memorization is a problem in and outside of schools. Don’t get us wrong; it has its place, but it is the de facto standard because this is the way it’s always been done as opposed to that it works. It always burned us—and not because we got those questions wrong in some database administrator certification question that asked us the exact keyword to change the prefetching size for a buffer pool in a list of tricky syntaxes with subtle differences no one cares about. And what about those “select all that apply” questions that don’t tell you how many apply—don’t even. Imagine a database exam that spawns a live environment with a buffer pool overflow condition where the candidate must disposition that situation. We’re not talking about proctored controls on your laptop, but rather free-form access to the internet and LLMs. This is how people work today. They learn, research, learn, and so it goes. It’s not here yet, but the world needs to move on from the art of memorization for many accreditations where it is being used today.</p>
</div>

<p>A great use case for GenAI and agents is to shift-left<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="shifting left" data-secondary="in education" data-secondary-sortas="education" data-type="indexterm" id="id650"/> the identification of vulnerable students and get better insights about them dropping out of school. After all, a student usually drops out due to a combination of circumstances that are not all academic. AI can be put to work to keep more students in their seats using its predictive elements to intervene with timely supports before it’s too late. Agents can really help here as well; for example, once a situation is identified, reach-out messages, appointment bookings, and notifications to the broader supporting ecosystem (professor, teaching assistants, registrar’s office, accounting, and more) could all be handled agentically. But before AI can help, you need the data (that whole IA thing); remember, to solve any complex problem, you need to <em>collect</em> the dots before you can <em>connect</em> the dots.</p>

<p>There are also tons of use cases for education institutions that have nothing at all to do with education. You’ll find them in other sections in this chapter, but when you consider that approximately 70% of university costs are related to staffing, there is more here to help than at first glance.</p>

<p>Other use cases involve average mark range change, augmented or virtual reality training and testing, curriculum development, dynamic testing, ESL assistance to reduce friction for non-English speakers, initial grading, intervention management, operational and risk management, optimizing residency and operations, straggler identification, student retention, tuition planning, and more<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_usecaseseducation421457" data-type="indexterm" id="id651"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_educationusecase421457" data-type="indexterm" id="id652"/>.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Healthcare" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_healthcare_1740182047878579">
<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>This one is a doozy because the current cost run rate for most countries’ healthcare<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="healthcare" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_usecaseshealthcare422898"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="healthcare use case" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_healthcareusecase422898"/> programs is simply not sustainable. Case in point, the US inflation rate between 2011 to 2019 was 1.75%. For healthcare, it was 7.4%—that’s a multiple of over four! Add to this increasing chronic health issues (obesity, depression, diabetes, and now loneliness) and an aging population, and you quickly come to the realization that something must be done quickly. When did you last see a general practitioner? Did you even get 15 minutes of direct eye contact with them? It’s not that they don’t like you, but much of their time is spent typing about you into their computer and then moving on to the next appointment in their overbooked schedule. That’s because medical practitioners note that they spend just under 40 hours a week on clinical documentation, communication, and authorization interchanges with insurance companies; in fact, time spent on various administrative tasks is one of the top reasons for practitioner burnout, which, of course, leads to staffing shortages.</p>

<p>GenAI and agents have so much potential here that we almost left this section out because we didn’t feel we could do it justice. That said, GenAI also has a complex path ahead between regulations, which use cases to tackle first, and ethics.</p>

<p>Prediction<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="prediction use case for AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id653"/> is a huge use case in this space. The obvious one is predicting disease onset, but with more and more strain on the availability of clinicians, predicting patient load and optimizing staff around that prediction are keys to de-stressing the system and need immediate focus. In fact, one hospital in Toronto uses a single AI algorithm to do most scheduling for nurses in their emergency room. That same hospital can literally predict that on Saturday, between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m., their emergency room will have about 80 patients, of whom 10 will have mental health issues and 12 will be hard to treat.</p>

<p>With the ability for AI to work its way through an unfathomable amount of information, there’s also a chance to flip the script on rare genetic diseases that come with heartbreaking stories of their victims suffering for years. They endure emotional suffering as well, with dozens—even hundreds—of doctor visits in a desperate attempt to uncover what’s wrong, only to be left without answers. The current system is geared toward catching these cohorts that are missed by the system. AI can change the odds here and bring diagnostic genetic assessments to the front of the care pathway as opposed to the back where they sit now. Finally, in what could be the ultimate shift right<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="shifting right" data-secondary="genetic disease example" data-type="indexterm" id="id654"/> potential (shifting right as in saving more lives), a new Canadian study found that an AI early warning application helped one hospital prevent unexpected deaths by 26%.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id655" id="id655-marker">16</a></sup> Can this scale more broadly and repeatedly? We’re not sure, but we’re encouraged.</p>

<p>Remember that the aforementioned (and ones that follow) use cases <em>are not</em> meant to replace medical staff, but rather to serve as an additional tool for patient care and the administration of facilities to support better patient outcomes.</p>

<p>Are you ready to explore AI’s role in modern medicine? Perhaps start with these use cases (and don’t forget the ones we covered in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_ai_to_ai_generative_ai_and_the_netscape_moment_1740182043982974">Chapter 1</a>): aftercare support, care continuum integration, charge capture duties, clinical analysis, data summarization or documentation (really any kind of clinical workflow), doctor and nurse burnout avoidance, discharge summaries, early disease detection, enhanced meal planning, fraudulent medical code uplifts, medical code verification, medical electronic health record integration, medical error reduction, memory supports, MRI and other scanning preliminary assessments, prescription adherence, payment processing, patient communications, portal messaging, registration and summarization, provider notes, radiology assistance, scheduling communications, and many others<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_usecaseshealthcare422898" data-type="indexterm" id="id656"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_healthcareusecase422898" data-type="indexterm" id="id657"/>.</p>

<h2>Insurance</h2>

<p>Insurance<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="insurance" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_usecasesinsurance423823"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="insurance use case" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_insuranceusecase423823"/> revolves around understanding and underwriting risk, and there sure is a lot of complex risk for insurance companies to navigate these days. Consider those underwriting property and casualty (P&amp;C) risks and the impact of more and more frequent and severe natural disasters. This is a critical need. After all, the 2025 California Palisades fire has a minimal cost estimate of $150 billion in damages, and upwards to $250 billion. What about the risk in pricing life insurance policies with an ever-growing unhealthy world population alongside new risks like pandemics? One thing we’re certain about: the insurance industry is a prime candidate for disruption through GenAI and agents, and this will have a major impact on insurance—specifically claims, distribution, underwriting, pay-per-use (we gave a great example in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_ai_to_ai_generative_ai_and_the_netscape_moment_1740182043982974">Chapter 1</a>), personalization (reimagining the insurer/insured relationship), and risk pricing.</p>

<p>Insurance companies could leverage GenAI in an agentic workflow with tool calls to build loyalty among policyholders while helping them avoid potential weather-related auto claims. Consider this: a single hailstorm in Phoenix once caused $20 million in damages! It’s been estimated that weather alerts give P&amp;C underwriters an opportunity to reach out to their clients 10 times a year (as opposed to just at renewal times or when a claim occurs). As the owner of a car in the path of a hailstorm, you don’t want your car damaged. Sure, the insurance will cover it, but that’s a hassle, there’s a risk of future rate increases, and so on, so we’ll just assume you’d rather not deal with such a situation. And we’re pretty sure your insurance company doesn’t want to pay for the repair, the rental, and more, either. There’s common ground here for both parties to act. What about an AI agent whose goal is to minimize the risk of damage to any assets under in-force policies. This goal-oriented AI goes to work to reach out to policyholders about an impending non-life-threatening but property-damaging storm. Based on proximity, forecasts, and other factors, it gives some suggestions such as, “Put your car in your garage” or “There’s sheltered parking within a three-minute drive from your current location; here are the directions.” We think you’d agree, most policyholders would value this kind of outreach if it were in their best interest (we would). As it turns out, one insurance company we worked with used this approach to boost client engagement and found that 52% of policyholders attempted to take action on such alerts. And of those that were able to take significant action, only 6.1% of them made a claim!</p>

<p>Here are a bunch of other insurance-based use cases where we think GenAI and agents can help: anomaly detection, automated claims assessment, compliance checks, claim leakage<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id658" id="id658-marker">17</a></sup> and combined ratio<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id659" id="id659-marker">18</a></sup> management, cost of risk prediction, consequence of failure modeling, customized policies, digital engagement, dynamic pricing and discounting, first notification of loss optimization (FNOL), fraud <span class="keep-together">detection</span>, new line market opportunity identification (like the ever-expanding gigabyte economy), parametrics, personalized risk profiling, product design, reinsurance underwriting, and so many others<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_usecasesinsurance423823" data-type="indexterm" id="id660"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_insuranceusecase423823" data-type="indexterm" id="id661"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Legal" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_legal_1740182047878684">
<h2>Legal</h2>

<p>GenAI and agents are about to become as essential to lawyers<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="legal" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_usecaseslegal424462"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="legal industry use case" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_legalindustryusecase424462"/> as coffee and BARBRI handbooks—shaping the future of this profession, one prompt at a time. Why is the opportunity for disruption here perhaps bigger than in most professions? Goldman Sachs noted that they believe 44% of day-to-day legal tasks could be streamlined or accelerated with the use of AI—that compared to a cross-industry average of 25%.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id662" id="id662-marker">19</a></sup> One of the reasons for this conclusion was because of the overlap of the very tasks that AI is good at and those that are used by lawyers. Think about it: tasks like analyzing documents, writing, drafting arguments and contracts, extracting information, researching, reviewing, and summarizing are all well suited for AI.</p>

<p>Think of the mountains of case law and discovery that are needed to build evidentiary support for a case. How do you sift through all that data? How could a single human comb through 260,000 documents to gain a full understanding of a particular point of view or how the details interconnect? This isn’t finding needles in haystacks; this is finding needles in stacks of needles.</p>

<p>Things will become even more overwhelming because what’s considered to be evidence has evolved too. For example, in Italy, WhatsApp (the second most bundled application in the world) evidence is used to divorce nearly half of Italian adulterers! Gian Ettore Gassani from the Italian Association of Matrimonial Lawyers notes, “We’ve seen adulterers using this service to maintain three or four relationships, it’s like dynamite.” We’re not sure what’s going on in Italy; however, it is evident that communication platforms (such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram) and the way we communicate (some courts have ruled that thumbs-up emojis can legally bind contracts over text) are fundamentally reshaping the scope and definition of <span class="keep-together">evidence</span>.</p>

<p>Now, think across all these documents and applications, and assume you wanted to scan them to figure out which people and companies are associated with each other in a loan table. You could use an agent that first goes through all your documents and uses the named entity resolution capabilities provided by its supporting LLM to capture and connect a list of people, places, and things. The workflow then outputs these connections in markdown, and a tool call converts markdown to a mind map that represents all parties in those documents and how they are connected to each other. Suddenly, you’ve got a visual of people and companies that are working together. This is a great approach for counterparty risk assessments (also used in insurance, banking, and so on).</p>

<p>One of our favorite use cases (surprise, surprise, it’s a horizontal one) for lawyers<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="talking to a document use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id663"/> is the ability to “talk to a document.” Open a document—like a court opinion or a newly passed law—and interact with that document in natural language. For example, if you (or a staffing agency you are working with) is using AI to hire in New York City, you must be aware of Local Law 144, which details laws around Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs). We used Ollama and the granite3-dense:2b<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id664" id="id664-marker">20</a></sup> LLM to summarize (from a corpus of documents) the considerations we should know about regarding this law:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
The text you provided is a set of rules and guidelines related to the use of 
Automatic Decision-Making Employment Tools (AEDTs) in New York City.
Here's a simplified summary:

1. **Bias Audit Requirements**: Employers and employment agencies must conduct 
a bias audit of their AEDT every two years, using an independent auditor. 
The audit should include calculations for all categories except those 
representing less than 2% of the data.

2. **Responsibility for Bias Audits**: Employers and employment agencies are 
responsible for ensuring they don't use an AEDT without a bias audit.
Vendors cannot conduct their own bias audits; they must hire independent
auditors.

3. **Notice Requirements**: Employers and employment agencies must notify 
employees and job candidates in New York City about the use of an AEDT and 
the job qualifications or characteristics it will assess. They must
provide this notice 10 business days before using the AEDT.

4. **Independent Auditors**: There's no list of approved independent auditors. 
They must be impartial and not have a financial interest in the employer
or vendor.

5. **Complaints**: If someone suspects a violation, they can contact 311 or 
the DCWP website to submit a complaint. Discrimination complaints should go 
to the NYC Commission on Human Rights.

6. **Exclusions**: Certain categories can be excluded from the required
calculations if they represent less than 2% of the data.</pre>

<p>See how the LLM quickly summarized the corpus of documents we fed it? Now you could customize this information and instantly prepare it for a client to shape the communication to a target audience. An example is a mailing from a Better Business Bureau in a welcome kit for new stores opening in the city, sent to a target audience that can’t process legal jargon, or perhaps communications to individuals where the client isn’t a native English speaker.</p>

<p>Like all the other professions, lawyers aren’t going away because of AI. Quite the opposite, we think the demand for legal advice and legal services will only go up when you consider the ever-growing complexity of the world—GenAI alone has created all kinds of legal question marks when it comes to fair use copyright. That said, we tend to agree with what Goldman was getting at in its report: leveraging AI to handle the initial round of “heavy lifting” significantly reduces stress and monotony (shift left), allowing attorneys to minimize the time spent on preliminary, lower-level reviews and do more cerebral work (shift right)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="shifting left" data-secondary="legal industry" data-type="indexterm" id="id665"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="shifting right" data-secondary="legal industry" data-type="indexterm" id="id666"/>. Of course, there are some serious gotchas in this industry (as with others, like healthcare) when it comes to AI, and we will cover some of those in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Other use cases for AI in law include arbitration prediction, automated due diligence, alternate dispute resolution support, correspondence, contract and legal drafting and amending, client service transformation, contract lifecycle management, document review, ediscovery, enhancing operational efficiency, facilitating access to knowledge, language or acumen barrier avoidance, legal research and document analysis, legal hold and preservation management for electronically stored information, negotiation support, predictive win-loss litigation or binding arbitration potential outcome rankings, streamlined case web intake, among other potential applications<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_usecaseslegal424462" data-type="indexterm" id="id667"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_legalindustryusecase424462" data-type="indexterm" id="id668"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Manufacturing and Production" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_manufacturing_and_production_1740182047878736">
<h2>Manufacturing and Production</h2>

<p>Manufacturing<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="manufacturing and production" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_usecasesmanufacturingandproduction428427"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="manufacturing and production use cases" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_manufacturingandproductionusecases428427"/> is one of those industries daring leaders for change. From supply chains that at times seem harder to understand than your high school crush, to heavy equipment that seems to have its own mood swings, production lines, don’t forget the people and processes, facilities management, and more. Truth be told, we bet you couldn’t walk through any manufacturing site without spotting a dozen problems where GenAI could be put to work to solve or ease the burden of that problem.</p>

<p>A great example of just how widespread GenAI is for this industry is the drafting of financial disclosure statements<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="financial disclosure statement drafts, use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id669"/>. Property, plant, and equipment (PP&amp;E) are part of a company’s <em>required</em> annual financial statements that represent a company’s day-to-day operations. Put AI to work by cutting a first draft based on last year’s disclosure dynamically updated with data, metrics, and journal entries for the current year. Obviously, financial disclosure requires tremendous oversight, so human-in-the-loop is critical, but this is a great head start. What’s more, over time (using techniques like InstructLab, which we cover in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_using_your_data_as_a_differentiator_1740182052172518">Chapter 8</a>), you could evolve your model with updates around Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) disclosure rules that <span class="keep-together">perhaps</span> changed since last year. We get it, this sounds like an accounting use case...because it is. We included it here because it’s a great example of accounting in manufacturing. Remember, you can stack both horizontal and vertical use cases in a business.</p>

<p>Additive manufacturing (AM)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="additive manufacturing (AM) use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id670"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AM (additive manufacturing) use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id671"/> is jargon that describes the manufacturing process of products by adding layer upon layer of materials. Those layers could be plastic, powder sheets, metal, concrete—and one day, human tissue! AM has been put to work for aircraft, dental restorations, medical implants, automobiles, and even fashion products. Some sort of modeling software (like computer-aided design [CAD]) is typically used to feed a sketch into the AM process, which starts adding its layers for the build. Earlier in this book we talked about how nonverbal or programming domain languages are evolving into LLMs. For example, Georgia Tech built polyBERT, an LLM that thinks about the chemical structure of polymers as a chemical language. This closely resembles the L’Oréal initiative we talked about in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_oh_to_be_an_ai_value_creator_1740182046162988">Chapter 2</a>, but with a language centered around polymers rather than makeup. This LLM can infer shapes and properties to predict how they may behave. An LLM to help in the design of CAD documents or the discovery of new bonding agents is a great manufacturing use case too. Not convinced? Just ask Bryson DeChambeau, who put to work his innovative edge with a set of 3D-printed golf clubs for his historic 2024 US Open golf win. Traditionally, top-tier golfers use forged clubs (white hot metal is pressed into shape), but the additive nature of Bryson’s golf clubs allowed his team to constantly iterate the design with a speed not available before. Think about an LLM built for golf, only without the curse words.</p>

<p>AI could also be put to work to weigh operational considerations (like usage, maintenance, and materials costs) to create an optimized production schedule to minimize downtime and maximize equipment availability.</p>

<p>When it comes to manufacturing, it kind of feels like the only limit is finding the problem to solve. Here are some others to help you do just that: bake contamination detection, compliance and regulations, color analysis, chemical dosing, energy efficiency, machine performance, materials design and discovery, improved defect detection rates, predictive maintenance, polymer characterization, proper gowning detection (and other worker safety tasks), quality escape identification and prediction, sustainability development goals, unplanned downtime mitigation, and more<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_usecasesmanufacturingandproduction428427" data-type="indexterm" id="id672"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_manufacturingandproductionusecases428427" data-type="indexterm" id="id673"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Pharma" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_pharma_1740182047878785">
<h2>Pharma</h2>

<p>Like every other industry, pharma<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="pharma" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_usecasespharma429247"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pharmaceutical industry use case" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_pharmaceuticalindustryusecase429247"/> is having its “AI glow-up” moment—except this one might save lives instead of just saving you some time summarizing the transcripts of the last five status calls you missed into “It’s on the road map.”</p>

<p>Consider the insights that could be gleaned from this sector’s vast amount of data. The possibilities stretch beyond imagination when you consider how companies typically don’t publish their failures from drug discovery or clinical trials. What could we learn from our failures if AI had access to research information about drugs that never made it to market for their intended use? Life sciences manufacturing generates high volumes of data that are typically scattered across internal and external systems that lack interoperability and consistency—what insights could be unlocked to create better patient outcomes or quality of life?</p>

<p>Now think about the use cases associated with shifting-left<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="shifting left" data-secondary="drug development" data-type="indexterm" id="id674"/> drug development times when you consider, on average, new drugs take 10 to 14 years to get to market with a total spend of about $2.6 billion. What’s more, only 8% to 10% of drugs that go into a clinic typically make it across the finish line.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id675" id="id675-marker">21</a></sup> Think about that for a moment: in this industry, if you failed only 80% of the time (doubling your success rate to 20%), you’d be an industry shift-left superhero!</p>

<p>Today, most clinical trials<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="clinical trials use case" data-type="indexterm" id="id676"/> experience suboptimal site performance for several reasons. First, more entrants into this space alongside shrinking populations require more specific characteristics to join a trial; that means the first-to-find/first-to-heal race is more competitive than ever. In fact, clinical trial recruitments can take up to 10 months for a mid-stage trial—AI has the opportunity to cut that in half.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id677" id="id677-marker">22</a></sup> Site selection (and the associated costs) is another factor. Perhaps a trial’s biggest challenge is patient recruitment and retention. Big Pharma has difficulty identifying, enrolling, and retaining diverse patients. In fact, this phase can take up to 30% of a company’s drug development timeline and can delay trials by months. What’s more, once subjects enroll in a trial, there’s an increased need to catalyze the adoption of new modalities to improve the patient experience and retention (another major clinical trial bottleneck that vastly contributes to delays). Now think horizontally about all the ways AI could be put to work for clinical trials supporting an analytics-driven enrollment strategy, patient-centered recruitment and retention strategies, and dynamic and predictive site monitoring.</p>

<p>What lies ahead in this area brings up enormous anticipation as quantum<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="quantum computing" data-type="indexterm" id="id678"/> computing comes more and more into play to even further accelerate drug discovery. For example, some 80% to 90% of our body’s proteins have eluded drug makers because experimental drugs won’t “dock” (get bind affinity) in the body so they can modify a target pathway. Take, for example, a ubiquitous drug like penicillin—to model its structure would require a classical computer that is a physical impossibility (it would need more transistors than there are atoms in the observable universe). But this falls into the realm of quantum possibility. What new compounds and drugs will the world <span class="keep-together">discover</span>?</p>

<p>Here are some additional GenAI and agentic use cases to inspire deeper thinking about its transformative potential in the pharmaceutical industry: adverse event reporting, batch contamination, care continuum integration, cold chain<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id679" id="id679-marker">23</a></sup> custody optimization, compound design, dynamic inventory management, enhanced patient education with dynamic instructional complexity, more diverse clinical trial enrollments, optimized drug formulations, optimized production processes, predicting drug interactions, repurposing existing drugs, quality assurance simulation, and more<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_usecasespharma429247" data-type="indexterm" id="id680"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_pharmaceuticalindustryusecase429247" data-type="indexterm" id="id681"/>.</p>

Now that you’re at this part in the book, we’ve uncovered a bit more. We’ve now evolved from a “formula” to the “scaffolding” of successful AI: our building blocks of AI. And if our AI Value Creation Curve was your inspiration, then the building blocks of AI (shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_3_1740182047851308">Figure 4-3</a>) will be your foundation.</p>

<p>As we stated throughout this chapter (and this book), business value must start with use cases, because the best way to bring this AI moment to life is to talk about what it means for your business. Remember, alignment between business strategy and technology strategy is the north star.</p>

Your data is prepared for AI through an information architecture (IA), which we discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_oh_to_be_an_ai_value_creator_1740182046162988">Chapter 2</a> and will explore further in terms of its benefits in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_using_your_data_as_a_differentiator_1740182052172518">Chapter 8</a>.</p>

This building block includes considerations for cost-effectiveness, deployability, trust, transparency and openness, and performance. There’s a new class of LLMs referred to as small language models (SLMs). You got a glimpse at their effectiveness when we talked about AI-infused coding assistants earlier in this chapter. There are new architectures like Mixture of Experts (MOEs) that are used by model builders like IBM, DeepSeek, and Mistral. Your company won’t be defined by a single model.
