It serves as a training resource for \ncreating Kubernetes operators using standard toolkits. \nThe README explains how to set up and run the operator, \nincluding steps for deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster, \ntesting it, and modifying its API definitions. The project adheres\nto Kubernetes' Operator pattern, aiming to synchronize resources\nto their desired state.\n\nFeatures and Technologies Used\n\nThe repository is built using Go and utilizes Kubernetes operator\ndevelopment principles. It leverages Kubebuilder to create \ncontrollers that follow the Kubernetes Operator pattern. The \noperator interacts with Kubernetes clusters, managing Custom \nResource Definitions (CRDs) and ensuring the cluster state matches\nthe desired configuration. Additionally, the repository provides\nMakefile targets for tasks such as building, deploying, and \nuninstalling the operator.\n\n```", "```py\nCreate a link to click on to open a new pull request to merge the\ndev branch into main.\n\n```"]
