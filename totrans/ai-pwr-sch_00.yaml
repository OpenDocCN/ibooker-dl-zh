- en: Search engines serve as the gateway to accessing most of human knowledge. Web
    search engines offer a queryable cache of the internet, allowing you to instantly
    find information on any topic across billions of websites. Generative AI (artificial
    intelligence) relies heavily on search engines to perform retrieval augmented
    generation (RAG), which is the process of using search to find relevant context
    to provide to AI models so that they generate accurate responses for incoming
    prompts.

    from e-commerce, to email, to social media, to company intranets and private filesystems.
    Performing search well requires optimizing search relevance—the ability to find
    and rank the most relevant results for a given query.'

    1 provides an introduction to AI-powered search, highlighting the major topics
    you’ll learn throughout the book. Chapter 2 is about working with natural language,
    providing background into key natural language processing (NLP) concepts needed
    to implement AI-powered search. Chapter 3 then dives into relevance ranking, covering
    the mechanics of how search engines and vector databases find and rank the best
    results for a given query. Finally, chapter 4 covers crowdsourced relevance, the
    process of using ongoing user interactions with your search results to learn models
    that improve relevance ranking.
