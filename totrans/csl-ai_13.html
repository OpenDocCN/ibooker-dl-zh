<p>In part 4, we’ll turn our attention to the application of causal inference methods to practical problems. You will gain hands-on experience with causal effect estimation workflows, automated decision-making, and the integration of causality with large language models and other foundation models. By this end of this part, you’ll be able to use machine learning–based methods for causal effect estimation, as well as use causal inference methods to enhance modern machine learning applications from reinforcement learning to cutting-edge generative AI.</p>
