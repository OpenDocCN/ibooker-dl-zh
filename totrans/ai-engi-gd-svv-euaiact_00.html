      <h1>Preface</h1>
      <p>The European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act, which came into full effect in August 2024, represents a watershed moment in the global regulation of artificial intelligence. As the first comprehensive legal framework for AI, its stated purpose is clear: to foster innovation and development within the EU while effectively mitigating the potential risks posed by AI systems. This ambitious regulation establishes a uniform legal framework governing the development, placement on the market, putting into service, and use of AI systems across the EU.</p>
      <p>Navigating the complexities of the EU AI Act might, at first glance, seem like a task exclusively for legal teams and policy experts. The Act is indeed complex, featuring 113 articles that address highly technical issues, complemented by 13 annexes that detail implementation specifics and 180 recitals (introductory statements providing context and guidance for interpretation). However, as the practical requirements of the EU AI Act reveal, <em>achieving and maintaining compliance with the Act is fundamentally an engineering problem</em>. This is the core message of this book.</p>
      <p>Operationalizing EU AI Act compliance goes far beyond legal interpretation. It requires establishing roles, processes, structures, and AI engineering practices. Post-market compliance, for instance, directly necessitates the implementation of machine learning operations (MLOps) practices such as monitoring and alerting. Successfully achieving EU AI Act compliance is linked to understanding the design, development, and maintenance of AI systems.</p>
      <p>Compliance is not a legal stamp applied at the end of the development lifecycle, but a continuous process that must be engineered into the core of AI systems from the beginning. The Act’s foundation on the concept of “trustworthy AI” mandates that systems be lawful, ethical, and robust throughout their entire lifecycle. This necessitates embedding ethical and compliance aspects directly into the AI system development process.</p>
      <p>This book serves as your guide to tackling EU AI Act compliance as the engineering challenge it is. We’ll explore various practical methodologies and frameworks essential for this task, including:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>AI engineering</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Defined as the application of software engineering principles to the end-to-end lifecycle of AI systems—including design, development, deployment, and <span class="keep-together">maintenance</span>. </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>CRISP-ML(Q)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>This structured machine learning development process provides a blueprint for designing, developing, and maintaining AI systems with compliance in mind. Its emphasis on quality assurance and continuous risk management throughout the AI lifecycle is directly aligned with the EU AI Act’s risk-based approach. CRISP-ML(Q) requires documentation of the entire development process, including risk management measures, which is crucial for meeting the Act’s technical documentation and transparency obligations. </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>MLOps Stack Canvas</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The MLOps Stack Canvas is a comprehensive and practical framework designed to guide organizations in architecting and managing their machine learning operations infrastructure. The canvas is structured around three core domains: Data and Code Management, Model Management, and Metadata Management. It provides a holistic view of the components necessary for successful ML deployment. By aligning with the CRISP-ML(Q) process model, the canvas ensures that each phase of the ML lifecycle is addressed, from data sourcing and versioning to model deployment and monitoring. It emphasizes critical aspects such as reproducibility, reliability, and efficiency, helping teams to plan infrastructure costs, select appropriate tools, and establish robust workflows. Serving as both a <span class="keep-together">strategic</span> and an operational tool, the MLOps Stack Canvas facilitates clearer communication among stakeholders for all ML and AI initiatives across the <span class="keep-together">organization</span>. </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>SMACTR (Scoping, Mapping, Artifact Collection, Testing, and Reflection)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Introduced as an internal audit framework to guide the practical implementation of ethical AI development throughout its lifecycle, SMACTR promotes a proactive and preventive approach for AI development. Embedding audit processes into the design and development phases allows engineers to anticipate and address potential risks before deployment, aligning perfectly with the Act’s emphasis on risk mitigation. SMACTR’s focus on generating detailed documentation at each stage is also essential for meeting the Act’s technical documentation requirements for high-risk AI systems.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p class="pagebreak-before">The synergy between CRISP-ML(Q) and AI engineering offers a powerful framework for addressing EU AI Act compliance. Furthermore, the integration of SMACTR with the CRISP-ML(Q) methodology provides a robust and auditable process for responsibly developing AI systems. This combination allows for proactively engineering compliance into the ML lifecycle, from data collection through monitoring, rather than treating it as an afterthought.</p>
      <p>The book also explores how these engineering principles apply across the Act’s risk classifications—prohibited, high risk, limited risk, and low risk. While high-risk systems face the most stringent requirements, Article 50 introduces transparency obligations that apply to all AI systems designed to interact directly with humans, regardless of their risk level. These obligations, such as informing users of AI interaction and marking synthetic content, demand practical engineering solutions for proactive compliance. Aligning AI engineering practices with SMACTR and CRISP-ML(Q) provides a structured and automated approach to managing the AI system lifecycle for transparency.</p>
      <p>This book also addresses the particular challenges posed by general-purpose AI (GPAI) and generative AI (GenAI), late but significant additions to the Act. The concept of generative AI operations (GenAIOps) is introduced as an extension of traditional MLOps principles to handle the unique complexities of GPAI and generative AI applications. Applying AI engineering principles to implement transparency obligations for GPAI and integrating CRISP-ML(Q), SMACTR, and GenAIOps are crucial for navigating this evolving landscape.</p>

        <h1>Who Should Read This Book</h1>
        <p>This book is intended for AI engineers, MLOps practitioners, data scientists, AI product managers, and anyone involved in the hands-on development and deployment of AI systems. It demonstrates how, through the application of robust methodologies, disciplined documentation, and continuous integration of ethical considerations, AI teams can build systems that are not only technically innovative but also demonstrably compliant, trustworthy, and aligned with societal expectations. I have tried to make this book as actionable as possible by introducing a comprehensive framework and practical checklists for aligning AI engineering practices with the EU AI Act articles throughout the CRISP-ML(Q) lifecycle.</p>
        <p>As ImageNet creator Fei-Fei Li, known as the Godmother of AI, <a href="https://oreil.ly/_PUIb">noted recently</a>: “Now more than ever, AI needs a governance framework.” This book provides the practical engineering foundation for implementing such a framework, enabling practitioners to build trustworthy AI systems that meet the stringent requirements of the EU AI Act through empirical validation, risk-aware development, and collaborative practices. The law sets the requirements, but it is the engineering that delivers compliance.</p>
