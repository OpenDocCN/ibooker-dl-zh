<p>To help you decide on AI investments, we must first find your AI
strategy.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="The Trap of Hype-Driven Implementation"><div class="sect1" id="id55">
<h1>The Trap of Hype-Driven Implementation</h1>
<p>If your AI strategy centers around a chatbot where customers can “ask
anything,” you’re not alone. Many companies are adding AI everywhere
without a clear strategy. This is a mistake. When everyone does the same
thing, no one stands out. Remember, a business’s strategy is to gain a
competitive edge. This advantage comes from having unique, delightful
products that are hard to copy.</p>
<p>Good strategy involves three key elements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A clear diagnosis of your organization’s challenges</li>
<li>A coherent plan of action</li>
<li>Alignment of resources to address these challenges</li>
</ol>
<p>The worksheet below will guide you through each of these elements
using an example.</p>

<h1 class="less_space">Identify Your Strategy Worksheet</h1>
<p>The best AI strategy amplifies your company’s strengths. Through this worksheet, you’ll learn how to create one.</p>

<p>Using ACME E-Commerce as our guide, we’ll walk through a step-by-step process to:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p><em>Diagnose</em> where your business is now.</p></li>
  <li><p>Create a <em>guiding policy</em> that sets you apart.</p></li>
   <li><p>Sequence <em>coherent actions</em> that move you forward.</p></li>
    <li><p><em>Communicate</em> your strategy effectively.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Remember: It’s not about using AI everywhere. It’s about using it where it counts most for your business. Let’s walk through an example.</p>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Macro environment</td>
<td><strong>Barriers to entry:</strong> It has made it easier for
startups to start. They can now innovate faster and at lower cost. <br/>
<strong>Industry convergence</strong>: AI has blurred lines. It has allowed
tech firms like Google and Amazon to enter healthcare and finance.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Internal capabilities</td>
<td><strong>Talent:</strong> Incumbents are struggling to hire and
upskill. The need for data scientists, AI engineers, and AI-literate
leaders has created a wide talent gap. <br/><strong>Decision
making:</strong> AI tools can help incumbents optimize pricing,
inventory, and marketing on-the-fly. This creates a need for faster
decision making.<br/><strong>Organizational structure:</strong> To use AI
in decision making, you must question hierarchical, bureaucratic
organizational models.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Competitive advantage</td>
<td><strong>Process power:</strong> AI speeds up product development by
massively reducing cycle times. Incumbents that rely on long R&amp;D
cycles are at a disadvantage.<br/><strong>Cornered resources:</strong> AI
has amplified the value of proprietary data. The more you can ethically
collect, the better your use of AI becomes.<br/><strong>Brand:</strong>
AI-driven improvements in customer experience (e.g. a seamless shopping
experience) can elevate and improve your brand’s
equity.<br/><strong>Switching costs:</strong> Personalization and
historical data lock-in can make it harder for your customers to leave
for another competitor.<br/><strong>Network effects:</strong> AI-enhanced
personalization helps to attract more users and create more engagement,
driving greater value for the entire service.<br/> <strong>Scale
economies:</strong> Automation of the productivity zone—reduction of
costs across manufacturing, customer service and logistics enables
companies to produce more with less.<br/> <strong>Counter-positioning:</strong> Real-time AI-powered services undermine
traditional manual methods. Example: Lemonade uses AI to process
insurance claims instantly.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Pricing strategy</td>
<td><strong>Profit maximization:</strong> Personalized, dynamic pricing
is being implemented, much to customer chagrin. Many airlines, Uber, and even
Burger King are implementing this. <br/> <strong>Penetration
pricing:</strong> Use of advanced customer segmentation to identify high lifetime value (LTV) cohorts to target with low introductory pricing is on the rise. <br/>
<strong>Skimming</strong>: Improved demand forecasting using AI is
suggesting when to lower prices to attract the next wave of more
price-sensitive customers while still maximizing revenue.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Ecosystem strength</td>
<td><strong>Time to market:</strong> Many incumbents are realizing they
can’t build all AI capabilities in-house. Instead, they are forming
partnerships with AI startups or acquiring them to infuse innovation
into their business models.</td>

<h2>ACME’s Diagnosis</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Diagnosis summary</dt><dd><p>Our business strategy has always
relied on penetration pricing. We aim to gain an edge by counter-positioning against the competitive field to attract our ideal customer profile. We haven’t
invested enough to boost our brand equity against the others. This is the moment to leverage AI and the new opportunities it provides.</p></dd>

<dt>Diagnosis detail</dt> 
<dd><p>Reasons our growth was impacted in 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. monetary policy contraction and rising interest rates slowed
the rate of new business starts in our target market. We haven’t been as
sensitive to this as we should have.</li>
<li>Our talent position is strong—10% of employee base is an AI
engineer, data scientist, or data engineer.</li>
<li>Competitors have used their resource advantage to invest in features
like AI enhanced site editing, automatic search engine optimization (SEO) with AI,
advanced analytics for merchants, and other core app integrations.</li>
<li>While our core product has advanced, we’ve kept our subscription
pricing the same.</li>
<li>Our net promoter score (NPS) remains extremely high, but our cost to serve has increased,
and our gross margins have decreased YoY.</li>
</ul></dd></dl>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Diagnosis: Pro Tips"><div class="sect2" id="id60">
<h2>Diagnosis: Pro Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>This diagnosis is best done first with five to six senior leaders at
your organization. A time-bound, recorded dialogue is a great way to
generate a first draft. It can be transcribed and refined on paper.</li>
<li>It’s tempting to try to do too much. Instead, first name and unpack
your sources of competitive advantage. This is where
to concentrate AI application.</li>
<li>Self-honesty is the best policy. You usually won’t have more than
two sources of world-class competitive advantage.</li>
<li>After your first draft, get help from other executives. It’s best to
assess your internal capabilities and team next.</li>
<li>Your diagnosis, no matter how complex your business, should fit on a
single page or less.</li>
<li>Once your draft is done, circulate it to the next level of leaders in
your organization for review and comment.</li>

<h2>ACME’s New Guiding Policy</h2>
<p>It’s rare to change the mission of a company, and so in this case we
don’t focus on it. We’ll focus on two of the most important components:
our business and product strategies. As a refresher, for ACME:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Business strategy</dt><dd><p>To be the one-stop shop for SMBs
that lack extensive technical expertise or large budgets.</p></dd>
<dt>Product strategy</dt><dd><p>Create a simple, user-friendly
platform that needs no tech skills. Charge a single price of $15 a month
with no sales caps and comparable transaction fees for payments.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>We know where our current source of competitive advantage has been
(i.e., counter-positioning) and have insights into the
future where we can look to create new competitive advantage with
AI.</p>
<p>The diagnosis is an instruction manual.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Guiding Policy Summary</dt><dd><p>Create new <em>durable advantage</em> by becoming the
de-facto ecommerce <em>brand</em> of choice by charging $0
platform subscription fees for all SMB customers. Update our product
strategy to reflect this. We’ll use AI in two main ways moving
forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>To increase our ability to amplify our more aggressive penetration
pricing strategy with internal AI customer segmentation and
targeting</li>
<li>To expand our single-product offering with AI SEO tools to ensure
SMBs rank in search results</li>
</ul></dd></dl>

<p>After establishing our strategic direction, let’s examine in <a data-type="xref" href="#table0404">Table 4-4</a> the key reasoning behind these decisions and potential pitfalls we avoided.</p>

page</em>, as follows:</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Why do we exist?</td>
<td><p>Mission: To empower small
businesses by providing accessible ecommerce tools that facilitate
digital growth.</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td>What do we do?</td>
<td><p>We provide a SaaS ecommerce
platform for small businesses to easily create and manage online
stores.</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>How will we succeed?</td>
<td><p>By creating new
durable advantage by becoming the de facto ecommerce
brand of choice by charging $0 platform subscription
fees for all SMB customers.</p><p>We’ll use AI in two main ways moving
forward:</p><ul><li>To amplify our more aggressive penetration pricing strategy with internal AI customer segmentation and
targeting</li><li>To expand our single-product offering with AI SEO tools to ensure SMBs rank in search results</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>What is most important right now?</td>
<td><p>Grow our
customer base and 2024 revenue by more than 25% YoY via the following
seven coordinated actions:</p><ul><li>Launch $0 subscription fee for SMB
customers</li><li>Implement AI-powered customer segmentation and targeting</li><li>Develop AI SEO tools for SMB merchants</li><li>Optimize customer
support with AI tools</li><li>Leverage AI for real-time
personalization</li><li>Form strategic partnerships with AI startups
</li><li>Enhance data collection</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Who must do what?</td>
<td><ul><li>CMO to lead new marketing messaging into the market, communicating
our updated product strategy</li><li>CTO to integrate AI SEO tools into the
platform</li><li>Sales to drive onboarding of new customers</li></ul></td>

<p>By integrating all of these steps, you will already be a step ahead
of your competitors. Your deep, hands-on understanding of your business
coupled with the right approach is worth more than any “AI strategy
framework” that a large consulting company will try to sell you.</p>
<p>For reference, <a data-type="xref" href="#table0406">Table 4-6</a> shows some of the frameworks that large consulting
firms will try to sell you.</p>
