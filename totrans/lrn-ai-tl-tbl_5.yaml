    metrics in Tableau Pulse. Now it is time to see what metrics in action look like
    for different industries. In this chapter, I share use cases for sales, finance,
    healthcare, and administering Tableau Pulse itself. My goal is that you’ll walk
    away from this chapter inspired by how you can implement Tableau Pulse into your
    analytics environment and how your end users can benefit from Pulse. In addition
    to giving you some inspiration, I’ll walk you through how to maximize and customize
    the insights section of Pulse metrics.

    with. Rare is the company that doesn’t have some type of product that they are
    offering up to customers. So in this first use case, I want to show you how to
    re-create an existing Tableau dashboard focused on a pipeline of sales opportunities
    for a software company using Pulse. This exercise can be helpful if you’re tasked
    with transitioning existing content or if you need to make a decision whether
    to start with Pulse or to construct an entire dashboard. It will also help illustrate
    the type of insights that are automatically generated versus what your end users
    may have to determine on their own.

    rising cost in cardiovascular drugs appears to be limited to a handful of suppliers,
    both preferred and nonpreferred. Knowing this, she can not only track the pricing
    fluctuations for these specific suppliers, but also feed this information back
    to the company’s medication buyers to immediately change their purchasing strategies.
    She has also followed all these metrics, ensuring they’re closely tracked until
    the issue is resolved.

    monitor itself. Recall from [Chapter 3](ch03.html#ch03_advanced_tableau_pulse_features_1732595608107486)
    that multiple data sets are included in the Admin Insights project that can help
    you understand how end users are working with Pulse. You can refer to that chapter
    to refresh your memory on the fields available and their definitions.

    shows five metric definitions you can create to get started. As you begin implementing
    Pulse in your Tableau environment, these will help you understand user adoption.
    They will also give you insight into the maturity of your Pulse environment by
    identifying how many data sources are in use and an understanding of how many
    child metrics are created from definitions. Instructions on how to construct these
    metrics are described in [Table 5-1](#ch05_table_1_1732595608890771).

    available in Admin Insights by using Prep Builder. For example, you can join the
    Site Content data source with the TS Users data source to include the user’s site
    role and license type. Similarly, you can include the Groups a user is a member
    of by joining to the Groups data source.

- en: You’ve now seen four distinct use cases for Tableau Pulse. In the sales example,
    you saw how an existing dashboard can be reimagined as Pulse metrics. As the example
    was explored, you saw how Pulse metrics provide a very direct insights experience
    compared to the self-service and exploration afforded in the dashboard. In both
    the finance and healthcare examples, you saw how fine-tuning the types of insights
    generated can be used for anomaly detection and concentrated risk detection, respectively.
    Additionally, within the healthcare example, you journeyed along with the pharmaceutical
    procurement manager through the creation of new metrics, ultimately leading to
    actionable intelligence for buyers. Finally, you saw a variety of metrics that
    can be created from Admin Insights that can immediately help you understand both
    user adoption and activity as your organization uses Pulse.
