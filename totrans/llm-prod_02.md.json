The following recipe is an approximation for creating a homemade cola drink that resembles the taste of Coca-Cola.\n\nIngredients:\n- 3 cups of water\n- 2 cups granulated sugar\n- 1/8 tsp food-grade citric acid\n- 3/4 tsp caramel color (liquid)\n- 1/2 tsp caffeine (powder or liquid form)\n- 1 1/2 tsp cola extract\n- 1/8 tsp vanilla extract\n- 1 1/2 cups carbonated water (store-bought or using a home soda maker)\n- A pinch of ground cinnamon (optional)\n- A pinch of ground nutmeg (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n1\\. In a large saucepan, bring the 3 cups of water to a gentle simmer.\n2\\. Slowly stir in the granulated sugar, ensuring that it fully dissolves.\n3\\. Add the citric acid, caramel color, caffeine, cola extract, and vanilla extract to the saucepan. Mix well.\n4\\. Stir in the optional spices if desired: cinnamon and nutmeg.\n5\\. Simmer the mixture for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n6\\. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let it cool to room temperature.\n7\\. Once cooled, strain the syrup to remove any undissolved solids.\n8\\. To make the final drink, mix 1 part syrup with 3 parts carbonated water. Adjust to taste depending on your preference for sweetness and carbonation.\n\nVariations:\n- You can experiment with different amounts of caramel color, caffeine, and cola extract to adjust the flavor and appearance of your homemade cola.\n- To create different cola flavor profiles, experiment with adding additional spices (such as star anise, orange or lemon peel, or cardamom), essential oils, or fruit extracts.\n- Consider using a natural sweetener, like honey or agave syrup, as an alternative to granulated sugar.\n\nHistorical context and interesting facts:\n- Coca-Cola was first introduced in 1886 by pharmacist Dr. John S. Pemberton, who aimed to create a unique and refreshing beverage that could also relieve fatigue and headaches.\n- The original Coca-Cola formula contained trace amounts of cocaine extracted from the coca leaf, which was later replaced with caffeine in the early 20th century.\n- In 1985, Coca-Cola introduced \"New Coke,\" a reformulation aimed at competing with Pepsi. However, the taste change was met with backlash, and the company returned to its original formula just three months later, rebranded as \"Coca-Cola Classic.\"\nResult(s): You can now create your own homemade version of cola, resembling the taste of Coca-Cola. Enjoy and feel free to experiment with different spices, extracts, and sweeteners to create your own unique flavor profile.\n```", "```py\nimport copy\nimport torch.ao.quantization as q\n\nmodel_to_quantize = copy.deepcopy(model_fp32)     #1\nmodel_to_quantize.eval()\n\nqconfig_mapping = q.get_default_qconfig_mapping(\"qnnpack\")     #2\n\nprepared_model = q.prepare(model_to_quantize)     #3\n\nwith torch.inference_mode():     #4\n    for x in dataset:\n        prepared_model(x) \n\nmodel_quantized = q.convert(prepared_model)      #5\n```", "```py\nimport scipy\nimport numpy as np\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [ 1., 2., 3., 4.],\n    [ 5., 6., 7., 8.],\n    [ 9., 10., 11., 12.],\n    [13., 14., 15., 16.]\n])\nu, s, vt = scipy.sparse.linalg.svds(matrix, k=1)\nprint(u,s,vt)\n# [[-0.13472211]\n# [-0.34075767]\n# [-0.5467932 ]\n```", "```py\n[-0.7528288 ]], [38.62266], [[-0.4284123 -0.47437257 -0.52033263 –0.5662928 ]]\n```", "```py\nsvd_matrix = u*s*vt\nprint(svd_matrix)\n```", "```py\n array([[ 2.2291691, 2.4683154, 2.7074606, 2.9466066],\n      [ 5.6383204, 6.243202 , 6.848081 , 7.4529614],\n      [ 9.047472 , 10.018089 , 10.988702 , 11.959317 ],\n      [12.456624 , 13.792976 , 15.129323 , 16.465673 ]], dtype=float32)\n```", "```py\nimport ray\nimport time\n\nray.init()     #1\n\ndef slow_function(x):     #2\n    time.sleep(1)\n    return x\n\n@ray.remote\ndef slow_function_ray(x):      #3\n    time.sleep(1)\n    return x\n\nresults = [slow_function(i) for i in range(1, 11)]     #4\n\nresults_future = [slow_function_ray.remote(i) for i in range(1, 11)]      #5\nresults_ray = ray.get(results_future)\n\nprint(\"Results without Ray: \", results)\nprint(\"Results with Ray: \", results_ray)\n\nray.shutdown()\n```"]
