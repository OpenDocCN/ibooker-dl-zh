<h1><span class="label">Chapter 2. </span>Azure AI Services</h1>

<p>Azure AI Services <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Services" data-type="indexterm" id="icd201"/>are packed with tools to help you automate tasks like language processing, image recognition, intelligent search, and content generation. What’s great is that you don’t need to be an AI expert to dive in. These services are easy to implement in both web and mobile apps, and with more than a dozen AI features available, you can use them on their own or mix them.</p>

<p>One of the best things about Azure AI Services is that they come prebuilt and ready to go. Powered by Microsoft’s high-performance Azure platform, these pretrained ML models are accessible to businesses of all sizes. So whether you’re a small startup or a large enterprise, you can tap into years of Microsoft’s AI research without needing to be a tech wizard. While many tools work right out of the box, others—like Azure AI Vision, Azure AI Speech, and Azure OpenAI Service—can be fine-tuned with your own data to meet specific needs.</p>

<p>Another cool feature is how easily you can plug Azure AI Services into your projects. Developers can access these tools through <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs" data-type="indexterm" id="id294"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs" data-type="indexterm" id="id295"/>Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs or SDKs. <em>Application programming interfaces</em> <em>(APIs)</em> allow <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="APIs (application programming interfaces), defined" data-type="indexterm" id="id296"/>different software applications to connect and communicate with one another—imagine them as digital bridges between your applications. For example, when you book a flight online, the airline’s website uses an API to check available seats and prices from its database. Similarly, when a weather app fetches the latest forecast, it communicates with a weather service’s API to retrieve that data in real time. <em>Software development kits (SDKs)</em>, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="SDKs (software development kits)" data-type="indexterm" id="id297"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="software development kits (SDKs)" data-type="indexterm" id="id298"/>on the other hand, bundle all the tools, libraries, and documentation developers need to build apps for specific platforms. This makes the whole process smoother. Plus, Azure AI Services integrate with other Microsoft services like Azure Logic Apps and Power Automate. This makes Azure AI Services even more versatile.</p>

<p>For the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="topics covered by" data-type="indexterm" id="id299"/>AI-900 exam, you won’t need to dive into the technical nitty-gritty of these services. But you should have a good understanding of what they do, and that’s what we’ll look at in this chapter.</p>

<h1>Basics of Microsoft Azure</h1>

<p>Microsoft <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Services" data-secondary="overview of" data-type="indexterm" id="id300"/>Azure is a huge cloud platform with more than two hundred services that can help you build, run, and manage applications in different environments. Here’s a quick look at some of the options you have:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Cloud</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>This <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cloud services" data-type="indexterm" id="id301"/>is probably what you picture when you think of Azure. It’s a network of remote servers where your apps and data live, allowing you to access your resources from anywhere. You can quickly scale up when demand spikes and scale down when things slow down—all without having to worry about the <span class="keep-together">hardware</span>.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>On premises</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>If you<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="on-premises services" data-type="indexterm" id="id302"/> need to keep certain data on premises for regulatory or security reasons, Azure provides the flexibility to run its services on your own local servers. In this setup, you manage the on-premises infrastructure.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>The edge</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>This <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="edge services" data-type="indexterm" id="id303"/>is about processing data closer to where it’s created, like with <em>Internet of Things (IoT)</em> devices or in remote areas. Azure’s edge services let you reduce latency and bandwidth costs while keeping everything running smoothly, even if your internet connection isn’t always reliable.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>Azure has something for nearly every technical need. Whether it’s<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data storage" data-type="indexterm" id="id304"/> data storage with Azure Blob Storage <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure Blob Storage" data-type="indexterm" id="id305"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Blob Storage" data-type="indexterm" id="id306"/>and Azure Cosmos DB <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure Cosmos DB storage" data-type="indexterm" id="id307"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Cosmos DB storage" data-type="indexterm" id="id308"/>or running <em>virtual machines (VMs)</em> and<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="VMs (virtual machines)" data-type="indexterm" id="id309"/> containers with Azure Virtual Machines and Azure Kubernetes Service,<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure Kubernetes Service" data-type="indexterm" id="icd1028"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kubernetes Service" data-type="indexterm" id="icd1030"/> there’s a solution for you. And with more than 60 regions and 300 data centers worldwide, Azure’s scale is unmatched.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that Microsoft occasionally updates the names of its services or changes the Azure user interface. This means that some steps or visuals you see in this book might look a little different. To help with this, I set up a <a href="https://oreil.ly/L22C3">website</a> where you can find any necessary updates.</p>
</div></section>

<section class="less_space pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="Setup" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="i02_chapter2_setup_1742068260813529">
<h1>Setup</h1>

<p>To <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Services" data-secondary="setting up" data-type="indexterm" id="id310"/>set up an Azure account, just head over to <a href="http://www.azure.com"><em>www.azure.com</em></a>. If this is your first time using Azure, you can sign up for a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="free Azure accounts" data-type="indexterm" id="id311"/>free account. For the first month, you’ll get full access to the entire catalog of services and a $200 credit to explore everything Azure has to offer.</p>

<p>On top of that, Azure gives you free monthly usage of certain services, though there are some limits. For instance, AI services like <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Machine Learning Service" data-see="Azure Machine Learning" data-type="indexterm" id="id312"/>Azure<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure Machine Learning" data-secondary="trial period" data-type="indexterm" id="id313"/> Machine Learning and Cognitive Services <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure Cognitive Services" data-type="indexterm" id="id314"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Cognitive Services" data-type="indexterm" id="id315"/>are free for the first 12 months. With these, you can build, train, and deploy ML models or add AI features—such as speech, vision, and language—to your apps. You can try out services like Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics or Azure AI Vision <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Vision" data-secondary="trial period" data-type="indexterm" id="id316"/>during the trial period, all within the free usage limits.</p>

<p>Even after your first year, more than 55 services stay free as long as you stick to the usage caps. Some of these are AI focused too, like Azure Functions for running event-driven code and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure Kubernetes Service" data-startref="icd1028" data-type="indexterm" id="id317"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kubernetes Service" data-startref="icd1030" data-type="indexterm" id="id318"/>Azure Kubernetes Service for managing containerized AI workloads.</p>

<p>If you’re a student, Azure has a student account<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="student accounts" data-type="indexterm" id="id319"/> that includes $100 in free credits for 12 months—no credit card required.</p>

<p>Azure uses a<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pay-as-you-go model" data-type="indexterm" id="id320"/> pay-as-you-go model. Once your 30-day free trial or 12-month student plan is up, you’ll need to switch to pay-as-you-go if you want to keep using the services, but any leftover credit can still be used. Azure also has a <a href="https://oreil.ly/gF8eP">pricing calculator</a> and lets you set budget and cost alerts. There’s no long-term commitment, and you can cancel at any time.</p>

<p>For what we’ll be doing in this book, the free and student versions will be more than enough to get started.</p>

<p>What if your employer has a subscription to Azure? In that case, you should get approval to use it for preparing for the exam. It’s also important to note that your employer may limit access to certain services. Because of this, you might still want to set up your own account.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Create an Azure AI Resource" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="i02_chapter2_create_an_azure_ai_resource_1742068260813646">
<h1>Create an Azure AI Resource</h1>

<p>To <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Services" data-secondary="creating resources" data-type="indexterm" id="icd202"/>use an Azure AI Service, you’ll need to set up a resource first. Two options are available:</p>

<dl class="less_space pagebreak-before">
	<dt>Multiservice resource</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>This <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="multiservice resources" data-type="indexterm" id="id323"/>allows you to access multiple Azure AI Services using a single key and endpoint. An <em>endpoint</em> is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="endpoints, defined" data-type="indexterm" id="id324"/> the URL where your application connects to interact with a service. This setup is ideal for exploring various services like AI Speech, AI Vision, and AI Language or for projects that require using several services together. Plus, it simplifies billing by consolidating all services under one resource.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Single-service resource</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>This<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="single-service resources" data-type="indexterm" id="id325"/> is for when you need only one specific AI service. Each service gets its own key and endpoint. This makes it easy to track usage and costs separately.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>Which one should you choose? For the most part, it depends on what you’re building and how you want to manage costs.</p>

<p>There are different ways to create resources, but the easiest is through the Azure Portal. Just sign in, click “Create a resource,” and search for “Azure AI Services” in the marketplace if you want a multiservice resource. If you need only a single-service resource, search for the specific service, such as AI Face, AI Language, or AI Content Safety.</p>

<p>Once you’ve picked your service, click Create. You’ll need to fill in details like the <span class="keep-together">following</span>:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Subscription</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>This<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="subscriptions, to Azure resources" data-type="indexterm" id="id326"/> is the billing account for your Azure resources, which determines how you’ll pay for the service.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Resource group</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>This<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="resource groups" data-type="indexterm" id="id327"/> is a container that helps you organize and manage related resources in Azure.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Region</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>This<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="regions" data-type="indexterm" id="id328"/> is the geographic location where your service will be hosted. This will ensure optimal performance and compliance with regulations.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Pricing tier</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>This <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pricing tiers, for Azure resources" data-type="indexterm" id="id329"/>is the level of service you choose, which defines the features, performance, and costs associated with your resource.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>You’ll also need to give your resource a unique name for identification. <a data-type="xref" href="#i02_chapter2_figure_2_1742068260808591">Figure 2-2</a> shows what this screen looks <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Services" data-secondary="creating resources" data-startref="icd202" data-type="indexterm" id="id330"/>like.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Studios" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="i02_chapter2_azure_ai_foundry_1742068260813706">
<h1>Studios</h1>

<p>After<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Services" data-secondary="studios" data-type="indexterm" id="id331"/> creating<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Foundry" data-see="Azure AI Foundry" data-type="indexterm" id="id332"/> an Azure AI resource, you can start using it to build applications. You have a couple of options here—you can work with a REST API or SDK, but there’s also a simpler approach: using studios. These make it easy to experiment with Azure AI Services without needing to have deep coding skills. They have user-friendly interfaces that allow both beginners and experienced developers to explore, demo, and evaluate services. Here are a few studios you can use:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Vision Studio</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>This<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Vision" data-secondary="studio" data-type="indexterm" id="id333"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Vision Service" data-see="Azure AI Vision" data-type="indexterm" id="id334"/> lets you work with image and video analysis tools. You can try out features like object detection, image classification, and video analysis.</p>

It also has tools for custom language models.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Speech Studio</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Here<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Speech" data-secondary="studio" data-type="indexterm" id="id337"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Speech Service" data-see="Azure AI Speech" data-type="indexterm" id="id338"/>, you can explore Azure’s speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and real-time translation services. It’s a helpful tool if you’re looking to build apps that need voice interaction.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Content Safety Studio</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Designed<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Content Safety Studio" data-type="indexterm" id="id339"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Content Safety Studio" data-type="indexterm" id="id340"/> for moderating and detecting harmful content, such as violence or hate speech, this studio helps you set up safeguards against inappropriate content.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition to these individual studios, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Foundry" data-secondary="overview of" data-type="indexterm" id="icd204"/>there’s <em>Azure AI Foundry</em> (formerly called <em>Azure AI Studio</em>), which combines several Azure AI Services into one platform. Developers can use this web-based platform to create AI applications using the latest APIs and models.</p>

<p>To see how it works, let’s go through a quick demo using Vision Studio. You’ll find it on the Azure Portal under “Computer Vision.” If you don’t see it, just use the search bar to locate it.</p>

<p>Once you’ve clicked “Computer Vision,” select “Create Computer Vision.” You’ll be taken to a configuration page where you need to fill out a few details:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Subscription</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Choose<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="subscriptions, to Azure resources" data-type="indexterm" id="id341"/> your Azure plan, such as free trial or pay-as-you-go.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Resource group</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>If <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="resource groups" data-type="indexterm" id="id342"/>you already have a resource group, you can select it here. Otherwise, click “Create new” and enter a name for the group (e.g., “AI-Vision-Group”).</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Region</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Pick<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="regions" data-type="indexterm" id="id343"/> the geographic location where your Computer Vision resource will be hosted. Selecting a region close to you can help reduce latency and improve <span class="keep-together">performance</span>.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Name</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Enter<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="naming resources" data-type="indexterm" id="id344"/> a descriptive name for the resource (e.g., “AI-Vision-Service”). This makes it easier to manage and track your resources.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Pricing tier</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Select<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pricing tiers, for Azure resources" data-type="indexterm" id="id345"/> the pricing plan that fits your needs—whether it’s the free tier or a more advanced option with larger quotas. How is this different from the subscription? Your subscription defines how you pay for all Azure services while the pricing tier defines the specific cost structure for this particular service.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>Once you’ve filled everything out, review your settings and click Create. After the resource is set up, select “Go to resource” and then click “Go to Vision Studio.” You can see what the Vision Studio dashboard looks like in <a data-type="xref" href="#i02_chapter2_figure_3_1742068260808617">Figure 2-3</a>.</p>

</div></figure>

<p>You can either upload an image from your computer or choose a sample image. The AI will then generate a caption. In our example, it provides a caption for a group of cows grazing in a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Foundry" data-secondary="overview of" data-startref="icd204" data-type="indexterm" id="id346"/>field.</p>
