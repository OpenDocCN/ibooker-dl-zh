<section data-pdf-bookmark="Identifying User Segments, User Personas, Pain Points, and User Needs" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch03_identifying_user_segments_user_personas_pain_poi_1736793246808634">&#13;
<h2>Identifying User Segments, User Personas, Pain Points, <span class="keep-together">and User Needs</span></h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Understanding <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="core product management craft and practices" data-secondary="user understanding" data-type="indexterm" id="id579"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="user understanding" data-secondary="personas, pain points, and needs" data-type="indexterm" id="id580"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="user segmentation" data-type="indexterm" id="id581"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="customer segmentation" data-type="indexterm" id="id582"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="personas" data-secondary="understanding" data-type="indexterm" id="id583"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pain points" data-secondary="understanding" data-type="indexterm" id="id584"/>your users is of the utmost importance. A proficient PM should be adept at breaking down their broader audience into distinct segments or personas. This granularity helps tailor product features to address specific needs or pain points. For an AI product, this might mean discerning and hypothesizing which user group will benefit most from a smart algorithm or which segment might need a more intuitive interface.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Specifically, user segmentation is the initial and critical step in understanding your audience. <em>User segmentation</em> involves dividing a more extensive user base into smaller, more defined groups based on shared characteristics. The ultimate aim is to refine product strategies to cater to these groups. To achieve this, one must analyze user data, which can encompass demographics, behavior on the platform, purchasing histories, or levels of engagement.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Writing User Stories" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch03_writing_user_stories_1736793246808695">&#13;
<h2>Writing User Stories</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>User stories</em><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="core product management craft and practices" data-secondary="writing user stories" data-type="indexterm" id="icd309"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="user stories" data-secondary="writing" data-type="indexterm" id="icd310"/> are<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="user stories" data-secondary="defined" data-type="indexterm" id="id585"/> a fundamental tool in product management. They serve as concise, straightforward descriptions of a feature from the end user’s perspective. By centering the narrative on the user’s needs and experiences, user stories ensure that product development focuses on delivering real value.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In AI, where the interplay between human requirements and machine functionality is intricate, user stories help maintain this balance. They compel the development team to consider the user’s context in every design and implementation phase, fostering a user-centric approach that is crucial for the success of AI applications. Compelling user stories in AI also act as a bridge, translating complex technical possibilities into accessible benefits that resonate with users, thus driving greater adoption and satisfaction.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As an AI PM, crafting compelling user stories is even more critical. AI-driven solutions can be complex, often integrating advanced technologies that could easily drift away from practical user applications if not correctly anchored.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Here are some hypothetical user stories for various AI features that follow a particular three-line <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="user stories" data-secondary="template for" data-type="indexterm" id="id586"/>template:</p>&#13;

<h2>Assessing Trade-offs and Prioritizing in AI Product Management</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Not <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="core product management craft and practices" data-secondary="technical trade-offs" data-type="indexterm" id="icd311"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="trade-offs" data-secondary="technical" data-type="indexterm" id="icd318"/>all features or solutions, even if feasible, should be pursued. One of the key responsibilities of an AI PM is to carefully assess trade-offs and prioritize decisions based on business goals, technical feasibility, and ethical implications. This process is not straightforward, because AI systems often present a unique set of challenges that require balancing multiple competing factors. Assessing trade-offs means weighing the benefits of one feature against its costs and potential risks, while always aligning decisions with the company’s long-term strategy and user needs. Let’s break down some of the common types of trade-offs faced during decision making.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Accuracy versus speed" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch03_accuracy_versus_speed_1736793246808816">&#13;
<h3>Accuracy versus speed</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="core product management craft and practices" data-secondary="technical trade-offs" data-tertiary="accuracy versus speed" data-type="indexterm" id="id599"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="speed, accuracy versus" data-type="indexterm" id="id600"/> AI, particularly when designing systems that make real-time decisions, there is often a tension between the accuracy of an algorithm and the time it takes to process data. For example, in autonomous vehicles<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="autonomous vehicles" data-secondary="object recognition algorithms" data-type="indexterm" id="id601"/>, object recognition algorithms<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="object detection and recognition" data-type="indexterm" id="id602"/> must be accurate enough to detect pedestrians, vehicles, and obstacles. However, these algorithms also need to process that data in milliseconds to enable the car to make split-second decisions on the road. An AI PM must decide how much accuracy can be sacrificed to ensure that the system operates within the required time constraints. Too much emphasis on accuracy could delay the system’s response, making it unsafe. Conversely, prioritizing speed without sufficient accuracy could lead to errors, compromising safety and trust in the technology.</p>&#13;

Balancing complexity and simplicity often revolves around balancing ease of understanding and performance. For instance, in customer support chatbots<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="customer service chatbots" data-secondary="complexity versus simplicity" data-type="indexterm" id="id606"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="chatbots" data-secondary="complexity versus simplicity" data-type="indexterm" id="id607"/>, a complex NLP <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="NLP (natural language processing)" data-secondary="chatbots" data-type="indexterm" id="id608"/>model might handle nuanced queries better, and give more humanlike responses. However, such a system can be harder to explain, debug, and maintain. Simpler models, on the other hand, may be more transparent and easier to troubleshoot but could fall short in performance. PMs need to decide if the added complexity is justified by the incremental improvements in user experience or operational outcomes.</p>&#13;

However, there is a significant trade-off between gathering large volumes of data and ensuring that the data is of high quality, relevant, and ethically sourced. In fields such as <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="healthcare" data-secondary="data quantity versus quality" data-type="indexterm" id="id612"/>healthcare, AI models require extensive patient data to improve diagnosis accuracy. However, ensuring that this data is accurate, properly labeled, and compliant with privacy regulations such as GDPR <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)" data-secondary="data quality versus quantity" data-type="indexterm" id="id613"/>s critical. Collecting large amounts of low-quality or biased data can introduce problems that significantly undermine the model’s performance. The role of the AI PM here is to ensure that the data pipeline is robust, and that the focus is not just on volume but also on the quality and ethical considerations of data collection.</p>&#13;

For instance, in a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="content recommendation systems" data-secondary="generalization versus specificity" data-type="indexterm" id="id619"/>recommendation system, a general-purpose model might provide suggestions across various domains (movies, books, music), but could lose some accuracy in each domain compared to a specialized model that only focuses on one domain, such as recommending movies. AI PMs must assess whether the broader reach of a general model is worth the potential loss in performance for more specialized needs or whether a suite of specialized models offers better results despite increased development complexity and cost.</p>&#13;

<p>In reality, trade-offs aren’t just about choosing between A or B; the contrast might not always be obvious. I like to think of the different factors almost like <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="trade space" data-secondary="sliders in" data-type="indexterm" id="id643"/>sliders in a 3D trade space that you need to position precisely, as discussed next in <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:nopage" href="#ch03_defining_your_trade_space_1736793246809320">“Defining Your Trade Space”</a>.

<h2>Defining Your Trade Space</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Imagine<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="core product management craft and practices" data-secondary="trade space" data-type="indexterm" id="icd313"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="trade space" data-secondary="defining" data-type="indexterm" id="icd314"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="trade-offs" data-secondary="trade space and" data-type="indexterm" id="icd314a"/> you’re building an AI-powered feature. Your trade space could involve any of the aforementioned trade-offs. To give a quick example, let’s pick three trade-offs: balancing cost versus benefit, time to market, and risk versus reward. For this example project, you might decide that faster time to market is essential, which could mean choosing an off-the-shelf AI solution. But this choice might sacrifice some control and customization, pushing you to balance these losses by investing more in other areas, such as user experience or customer support.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This trade space isn’t static. As your project evolves, so do the trade-offs. Early in development, you might prioritize quick wins, but as the project matures, long-term sustainability and scalability might take precedence. Visualizing your trade space as a dynamic, shifting landscape allows you to make more informed strategic decisions.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Your trade space will be unique to your product, your market, and your organization’s goals. For example, a small startup might prioritize speed and agility, while a large enterprise might focus more on scalability and long-term ROI.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Here is my six-step guide to defining your own trade space:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ol>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Step 1: Identify key factors</p>&#13;
&#13;
	<p>Start by listing the main trade-offs relevant to your product, such as the factors mentioned earlier. At the very minimum, you will want to include cost, time, expertise, and risk. Some trade-offs will be more obvious and common, such as balancing privacy with personalization, but there might be different trade-offs that you will need to capture on a case-by-case basis by talking to your stakeholders. Research scientists might bring up new factors that you haven’t thought about; for example, aspects of the product that can be improved to ensure that the solution is robust and scalable and to keep computational costs low. It is a good practice to talk to your scientists, engineers, and UX designers to paint a full, accurate picture of your trade space.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Step 2: Rank priorities</p>&#13;
&#13;
	<p>Determine the relative importance of each factor. What’s non-negotiable? What are you willing to compromise on? Note that your stakeholders will have different goals. For example, stakeholder 1 might want to optimize for quality, whereas stakeholder 2 wants to optimize for time to market. Ultimately, you are responsible for painting the full picture by adding your vision and strategic thinking.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Step 3: Map out interdependencies</p>&#13;
&#13;
	<p>Understand how each trade-off influences the others. For example, reducing cost might increase time to market or decrease customization. You will definitely need to talk to your scientist, engineering, and marketing/PR teams.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Step 4: Visualize the trade space</p>&#13;
&#13;
	<p>Create a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="trade space" data-secondary="visualizing" data-type="indexterm" id="id646"/>visual representation of your trade space, such as a matrix or graph, where you can plot different scenarios and outcomes, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_2_1736793246780913">Figure 3-2</a>.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Step 5: Test different scenarios</p>&#13;
&#13;
	<p>Use <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="testing" data-secondary="with trade-space model" data-secondary-sortas="trade-space model" data-type="indexterm" id="id647"/>this trade-space model to simulate different decisions and their impacts. Adjust your strategy based on these simulations.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Step 6: Iterate and adjust</p>&#13;
&#13;
	<p>As your project progresses, revisit your trade space regularly. Adjust your priorities and strategies as new information becomes available or as market conditions change.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_2_1736793246780913">Figure 3-2</a> is an abstract graph that visualizes the trade space with various constraints factored in. It can help you during ideation and decision making. To create a trade space, identify all relevant constraints (such as resources, ethics, technology, or regulations) and trade-offs for your problem, then map these constraints as boundaries to define a solution space, visualizing where acceptable solutions lie within these intersecting limits. Your solution follows somewhere in the solution space. Make sure to explicitly call out the risks and opportunities of each <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="trade-offs" data-secondary="trade space and" data-startref="icd314a" data-type="indexterm" id="id648"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="core product management craft and practices" data-secondary="trade space" data-startref="icd313" data-type="indexterm" id="id649"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="trade space" data-secondary="defining" data-startref="icd314" data-type="indexterm" id="id650"/>trade-off.</p>&#13;

<h3>Software development methodologies</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="software development methodologies" data-type="indexterm" id="id754"/> are two popular development methodologies: Waterfall and Agile.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The <a href="https://oreil.ly/_nwjh">Waterfall methodology</a><sup> </sup>is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Waterfall methodology" data-type="indexterm" id="id755"/> a traditional, sequential software development approach characterized by its linear and structured phases. This model divides the development process into requirements gathering, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance. Each phase must be completed before the next one begins, with little room for revisiting a phase once it’s closed. While the Waterfall model provides a clear, predefined path that can simplify planning and execution, its rigidity is a notable limitation, particularly in projects requiring flexibility due to changing requirements or technologies. In environments where project specifications are unlikely to change and clarity is crucial from the outset, the Waterfall methodology can be highly effective.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The <a href="https://oreil.ly/xIkS9">Agile methodology</a> is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Agile methodology" data-type="indexterm" id="id756"/> a dynamic and collaborative software development approach designed to quickly accommodate change and deliver value. Unlike the Waterfall model, Agile breaks the project down into smaller, manageable increments known <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sprints" data-type="indexterm" id="id757"/>as <em>sprints</em>, typically lasting a few weeks. This approach emphasizes continuous planning, testing, and iterations.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Agile fosters a collaborative work pattern that highly values feedback. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="feedback loops" data-type="indexterm" id="id758"/>Feedback loops help ensure that the development aligns closely with user needs and that adjustments to a model can be made in real time. Agile’s iterative nature allows for rapid releases and swift change, making it ideal for dynamic and uncertain environments.</p>&#13;

<h3>Estimation frameworks</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Estimation<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="engineering foundations" data-secondary="technical concepts" data-tertiary="estimation frameworks" data-type="indexterm" id="icd324"/> frameworks accurately forecast the time and resources required for various tasks and projects. This section looks at several frameworks and techniques that provide a high-level approach to planning.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Top-down estimation." data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="ch03_top_down_estimation_1736793246810949">&#13;
<h4>Top-down estimation.</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="top-down estimation" data-type="indexterm" id="id759"/>method starts with the overall scope of a project and estimates its total effort or cost based on past projects of a similar scale. Top-down estimation is particularly useful in the early stages of project planning when detailed information about the specific tasks and deliverables is unavailable. It’s an effective approach for setting initial budgets, timelines, or project feasibility, especially when speed is a priority and the granular details are not yet defined. However, it may be less accurate for complex or highly detailed projects, as it makes generalizations that might not account for unique challenges or nuances.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Bottom-up estimation." data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="ch03_bottom_up_estimation_1736793246811006">&#13;
<h4>Bottom-up estimation.</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Often<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="bottom-up estimation" data-type="indexterm" id="id760"/> used jointly with top-down estimation, <a href="https://oreil.ly/4lCT5"><em>bottom-up estimation</em></a><sup> </sup>involves breaking a project down into smaller, detailed components and estimating the effort for each before summing them to get a total project estimate. This granular approach allows PMs to assess the scope and needs of a project more accurately, considering specific factors and complexities of each component. By implementing bottom-up estimation, you can set realistic expectations and timelines, allocate resources more effectively, and mitigate the risks associated with project overruns.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Parametric evaluation." data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="ch03_parametric_evaluation_1736793246811062">&#13;
<h4>Parametric evaluation.</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Another<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="parametric evaluation" data-type="indexterm" id="id761"/> valuable technique is <a href="https://oreil.ly/tX6kT"><em>parametric estimation</em></a>, which relies on mathematical models and historical data to generate precise forecasts. By identifying key variables—such as cost per unit, time per task, or labor hours—and applying them to the scope of a project, parametric estimation provides a systematic way to assess resource needs. This approach is most effective when dealing with repetitive or scalable projects, where robust historical data and clear metrics are available. For example, in construction, manufacturing, or software development, parametric estimation can deliver reliable and consistent results. It’s less suitable for one-of-a-kind projects or innovative tasks where historical data or clear metrics might be<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="engineering foundations" data-secondary="technical concepts" data-startref="icd324" data-tertiary="estimation frameworks" data-type="indexterm" id="id762"/> unavailable.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Expert judgment evaluation." data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="ch03_expert_judgment_evaluation_1736793246811119">&#13;
<h4>Expert judgment evaluation.</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Another<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="expert judgment evaluation" data-type="indexterm" id="id763"/> widely used approach, <a href="https://oreil.ly/N4uh_"><em>expert judgment estimation</em></a> involves leveraging the insights and experience of professionals with deep knowledge of the domain. Experts evaluate the scope, challenges, and requirements of a project to provide an informed estimate based on their prior experience with similar initiatives. Expert judgment is especially useful in scenarios where historical data is limited, the project involves innovation or unique elements, or the environment is uncertain. For example, when launching a novel product, developing a prototype, or managing a high-risk project, the nuanced perspectives of experienced professionals can help anticipate challenges and provide practical estimates. However, it’s less ideal when objective, quantitative data is available and could provide greater accuracy or consistency.</p>&#13;

<h1>The AI Product Development Lifecycle and Operational Awareness</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Comprehending<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI PMs (AI product managers)" data-secondary="skill set for" data-tertiary="AIPDL and operational awareness" data-type="indexterm" id="icd305a"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AIPDL (AI Product Development Lifecycle)" data-seealso="AI lifecycle" data-type="indexterm" id="id773"/> fundamental<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI lifecycle" data-secondary="stages of" data-type="indexterm" id="icd305b"/> concepts such as ML algorithms, model training, fine-tuning, LLMs, model quality, and data management is crucial for effectively managing AI products. Grasping these concepts enables you to make informed decisions about designing, developing, and deploying AI systems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Understanding ML algorithms helps you select the right approach to solve specific problems, while knowing model-training processes ensures that these algorithms perform optimally. You need to be able to assess model quality—this is essential to guaranteeing that AI products meet the required standards and deliver reliable predictions. Additionally, effective data management strategies are vital to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the data used for training AI models. These competencies form the backbone of successful AI product management, ensuring that products function efficiently and align with broader business goals and ethical standards. To understand these concepts, let’s dive into the lifecycle of AI.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before"><a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_the_ai_product_development_lifecycle_1736793245641371">Chapter 2</a> introduced the AI Product Development Lifecycle and talked about the AI MVP. In this section, we’ll take a closer look at the AIPDL. Understanding its stages is crucial, because they outline the path from an initial idea to a functioning AI product that can be iterated on and improved over time. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_3_1736793246780937">Figure 3-3</a> shows the phases of the AI lifecycle.

<h2>Project Scoping</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Before <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI lifecycle" data-secondary="stages of" data-tertiary="project scoping" data-type="indexterm" id="id776"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="project scoping stage, of AI lifecycle" data-type="indexterm" id="id777"/>any development begins, you need to have a clear and actionable plan. This is where project scoping comes in. By this point, you should have a finalized PRD, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="PRDs (product requirements documents)" data-secondary="project scoping" data-type="indexterm" id="id778"/>as mentioned in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_the_ai_product_development_lifecycle_1736793245641371">Chapter 2</a>, that defines the objectives, user needs, success metrics, and constraints of your AI product. <em>Project scoping</em> is all about the engineering team translating the product requirements into technical boundaries and expectations. What problems are you trying to solve? What outcomes are you aiming for? What data sources will be involved?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For example, if you’re building an AI-powered personalized content recommendation system<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="content recommendation systems" data-secondary="project scoping" data-type="indexterm" id="id779"/> for a video streaming platform, the project scope might involve identifying key user interaction data to capture (such as viewing history, genre preferences, and watch duration) and setting a clear objective to increase user engagement by recommending relevant content. The PRD in this case would detail the types of data needed, the integration points with the existing platform, and the key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure success.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This phase also includes setting up initial alignment with cross-functional teams (engineering, data science, legal, design). Clear project scoping avoids scope creep and allows everyone to have a shared understanding of the project’s goals and the path forward. It’s a good practice to explicitly call out what is <em>out</em> of scope, which will help you set the right expectations for your cross-functional partners.</p>&#13;

		<p>In cases where real-world data is scarce or sensitive (such as with medical data), you can <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="synthetic data" data-secondary="generation of" data-type="indexterm" id="id832"/>generate <em>synthetic data </em>to simulate possible scenarios. This can involve creating artificial images for computer vision models, generating customer behavior scenarios for recommendation engines, or synthesizing voice data for speech recognition<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="speech recognition" data-type="indexterm" id="id833"/> models. (This is a suboptimal data source and should be used as a last resort, when you lack better data or resources.)</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>When collecting user data, especially for products such as <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="content recommendation systems" data-secondary="regulatory compliance" data-type="indexterm" id="id834"/>content recommendation systems or social media tools, you must ensure<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="regulatory compliance " data-secondary="data collection" data-type="indexterm" id="id835"/> compliance with regulations like GDPR<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)" data-secondary="data collection stage of AI lifecycle" data-type="indexterm" id="id836"/>. This involves implementing robust safeguards to protect user information throughout the data handling process. The need for such measures stems not only from legal requirements, but also from the ethical responsibility to respect user privacy and trust.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Ensuring data protection serves several critical functions. First, it helps maintain user trust, a vital component of user retention and brand reputation. Users are more likely to engage with platforms that they believe handle their data securely and transparently. Second, compliance with data protection laws helps avoid significant legal and financial penalties that can arise from data breaches or misuse. These regulations require that data be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and handled in a way that is secure, which minimizes the risk of breaches and misuse.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Moreover, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ethics" data-secondary="data collection" data-type="indexterm" id="id837"/>ethical data use involves more than just compliance; it includes a commitment to fairness and nondiscrimination in automated decisions made by algorithms. This is particularly important in content recommendation and social media, where algorithms can potentially shape public opinion or impact individual behaviors. By adopting ethical data practices, companies ensure that their systems do not perpetuate biases or lead to unfair outcomes, thereby fostering a more inclusive digital environment.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s continue with the example of building a content recommendation system<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="content recommendation systems" data-secondary="data collection" data-type="indexterm" id="id838"/>. In the data collection phase, you’d gather data from various sources, such as user behavior logs (clicks, watch history), content metadata (genres, directors, and actors), and user-generated information (ratings, reviews).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For a different example, if you were developing an AI image recognition<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="image recognition" data-secondary="open source data" data-type="indexterm" id="id839"/> tool for a social media app, you’d rely on open source image datasets, publicly available photos, or even user-uploaded content to build your dataset. This would involve collecting and manually labeling thousands of images into various categories to train the model to accurately identify objects in new images. The process might also include pulling data from image repositories.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Data collection is just the starting point. The value of data comes from how we label, classify, and make meaning out of information. In data science, the task of cleaning, labeling, and structuring data in a format suitable for model training is known as <em>data preprocessing</em>. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data preprocessing" data-type="indexterm" id="id840"/>This process starts with data cleaning. This involves removing or correcting inaccurate, incomplete, or irrelevant data points, which can significantly skew the outcomes of any analysis. Once we have a clean dataset, we continue to label data. By classifying data, we help the model learn to correctly identify input data. Moreover, classifying data into appropriate categories makes it easier to apply specific analyses and predictive models that require structured inputs. This classification might involve sorting data into predefined categories or creating new ones that better represent the underlying patterns and relationships.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Data collection and processing is not a one-time task; it’s an evolving process. As you gather more user interactions or receive more content, you’ll need to refine your data pipeline continually. As the environment changes and user behaviors evolve, routine updates to the datasets help ensure that models are trained on quality <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI lifecycle" data-secondary="stages of" data-startref="icd326" data-tertiary="data collection" data-type="indexterm" id="id841"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data collection stage, of AI lifecycle" data-startref="icd331" data-type="indexterm" id="id842"/>data.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="less_space">Model Training</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Model <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI lifecycle" data-secondary="stages of" data-tertiary="model training" data-type="indexterm" id="id843"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="model-training stage, of AI lifecycle" data-type="indexterm" id="id844"/>training is the core phase of developing your product. This is where the magic happens, as your data is fed into the algorithms to create a model that can make predictions or provide insights. You need to embrace an experimental mindset, because you might try different algorithms, adjust hyperparameters, and evaluate initial performance to find the best approach.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>At this stage, it’s important to state the difference between an algorithm and a model in the context of data science and ML. While these terms are often used interchangeably, they refer to distinct concepts.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>An <em>algorithm</em> is a set of rules that defines how to perform a task, in many instances, to make decisions. For example, decision trees, regression, and clustering are types of algorithms that describe the steps needed to solve a problem.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A <em>model</em>, on<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="models, defined" data-type="indexterm" id="id845"/> the other hand, is the specific use case of an algorithm that has been trained on data to solve a unique problem. A model is what you get when you feed data through an algorithm and allow it to learn from that data. It includes not only the algorithm’s structure but also the optimized parameters that make predictions or decisions based on similar data to the ones it was trained on. For instance, a model might be a specific decision tree that classifies whether an image is a cat or a dog determined by learning from a set of training images.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>While an algorithm can remain the same, different models can be developed from it by training on different datasets. This flexibility allows models to be optimized for unique business applications. For instance, if you’re building a chatbot for customer support<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="customer service chatbots" data-secondary="model training" data-type="indexterm" id="id846"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="chatbots" data-secondary="model training" data-type="indexterm" id="id847"/>, you might start by training a simple NLP<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="NLP (natural language processing)" data-secondary="chatbots" data-type="indexterm" id="id848"/> model using a dataset of past customer interactions. During this phase, you would select a relevant model (perhaps a transformer-based model, like GPT) and train it to understand and respond to various customer queries. You might need to revisit this step multiple times, tweaking the model to improve accuracy and relevance.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As an AI PM, understanding the basics of this phase and the trade-offs among the different approaches will help you communicate effectively with your data scientists. While you will never need to code as an AI PM, you will need to demonstrate AI awareness, especially when it comes to algorithms. At the end of this chapter you will find <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_6_1736793246781037">Figure 3-5</a>, a map of AI algorithms and applications, to help you understand what goes into model training and algorithms.</p>&#13;

<h2>Validation and Testing</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Once <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI lifecycle" data-secondary="stages of" data-tertiary="validation and testing" data-type="indexterm" id="id849"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="validation and testing stage, of AI lifecycle" data-type="indexterm" id="id850"/>your <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="testing" data-secondary="validation and testing stage of AI lifecycle" data-type="indexterm" id="id851"/>model is trained, the next step is validation and testing. This phase is crucial because it determines how well your model generalizes to new, unseen data. You’ll use separate validation datasets to test the model’s accuracy, reliability, and overall performance.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For the content <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="content recommendation systems" data-secondary="validation and testing" data-type="indexterm" id="id852"/>recommendation system, you might test the model by running it on a separate set of user data that wasn’t included in the training phase. This will help you see how well the model can predict user preferences and identify any biases or gaps in its recommendations. Similarly, for the chatbot, validation might involve testing the model with a variety of real-world queries to see if it provides helpful, accurate responses.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Testing is an iterative process. You might find that the model doesn’t perform as expected or that it introduces unintended biases. In these cases, you’ll need to go back to the previous phase—model training—and refine your approach. The cycle of training, validation, and adjustment is repeated until the model meets the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="MVQ (minimum viable quality)" data-type="indexterm" id="id853"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="minimum viable quality (MVQ)" data-type="indexterm" id="id854"/>MVQ required to launch.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Setting the MVQ is a critical decision, and there’s no single “right” or “wrong” threshold. As the PM, you determine this based on several factors, including user expectations, business goals, risk tolerance, and the specific use case of the AI product. For example, an MVQ for an AI-driven content recommendation system might be achieving a certain level of user satisfaction (often measured by qualitative metrics such as NPS and CSAT). In contrast, the MVQ for an AI medical diagnostic tool might require a higher threshold for accuracy to ensure patient safety, such as a 95% success rate in identifying a particular condition.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This iterative loop is key to building a robust AI product that provides reliable, valuable outcomes for users.</p>&#13;

Deployment is when the model moves from the development environment into a production environment and eventually goes live to the users. This step involves integrating the trained model into the product’s infrastructure, setting up the necessary environments (such as cloud services and APIs), and ensuring that the model can interact with other system components effectively.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">In our content recommendation system<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="content recommendation systems" data-secondary="deployment" data-type="indexterm" id="id857"/> example, deployment would involve connecting the model to the streaming platform, where it can access user interaction data in real time to make personalized content suggestions. For the chatbot, deployment might mean integrating it with a company’s customer support platform, allowing it to handle customer queries directly while learning from <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI lifecycle" data-secondary="stages of" data-startref="icd305b" data-type="indexterm" id="id858"/>new interactions.</p>&#13;

<h2>Remember to Keep Humans in the Loop</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>One<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI lifecycle" data-secondary="human-in-the-loop approach" data-type="indexterm" id="id859"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="human-in-the-loop approach" data-type="indexterm" id="id860"/> “horizontal” aspect that cuts across all stages of the AI lifecycle is the necessity of keeping humans in the loop. While AI brings powerful capabilities, it’s essential to remember that these systems function best when working alongside human expertise and oversight. Keeping humans in the loop ensures that your AI product not only learns from the data but also aligns with user needs, ethical standards, and business goals. Each stage of the AI lifecycle benefits from human involvement.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>During the model-training phase, human input is crucial. Data labeling often requires human expertise, especially in complex domains such as medical imaging and financial analysis. Involving human experts helps ensure that the model is trained on accurate, contextually relevant data, reducing biases and errors in the outcomes.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In the validation phase, human evaluation is essential for interpreting results and understanding the model’s strengths and limitations. Humans can identify subtle errors or biases that automated metrics might overlook, which is crucial for models deployed in high-stakes environments such as healthcare and autonomous driving.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Even after deployment, human <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="feedback loops" data-type="indexterm" id="id861"/>feedback loops are necessary. AI products should allow users to provide real-time feedback on recommendations or decisions. This feedback can then be fed back into the data collection and model retraining phases, creating an ongoing cycle of improvement.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_4_1736793246780958">Figure 3-4</a> illustrates where human input fits into the AI lifecycle. You’ll notice that human involvement isn’t isolated to a single phase; rather, it’s interwoven throughout the entire lifecycle. This ongoing collaboration ensures that the AI product remains adaptable, ethical, and aligned with user needs.</p>&#13;

Rather, it’s a suite of technologies and methodologies that empower a wide range of products and solutions across various industries. The map I created, shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_6_1736793246781037">Figure 3-5</a> (larger version <a href="https://oreil.ly/KDanI">available online</a>), provides an overview of how these technologies converge to create impactful and innovative applications.

<p>This map will help you understand what kind of AI <em>superpower </em>enables what kind of <em>AI-powered user experience</em>. There is, of course, no one-size-fits-all recipe, and there is significant overlap in these categories. However, my hope in creating this for you is to help you map out the different types of learning methods, algorithms, applications, use cases, and real-world examples. Please note this is not meant to serve as an engineering resource, and there are really infinite ways to visualize this, so I am not optimizing for accuracy, just for knowledge sharing (and fun!).</p>&#13;

<p>This is a high-level graph that maps algorithms to use cases from a product perspective, purely for illustrative purposes. The reality of AI product development often involves a more nuanced and complex interplay between different algorithms and use cases.</p>&#13;

It requires a substantial amount of labeled data and is generally used where the outputs are known and need to be predicted based on new inputs.</p>&#13;

<p class="pagebreak-before">Supervised<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="supervised learning" data-secondary="functionalities of" data-type="indexterm" id="id867"/> learning is suitable for classification tasks, such as the following:</p>&#13;

<p>There are many applications and use cases for supervised<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="supervised learning" data-secondary="applications and use cases" data-type="indexterm" id="id874"/> learning models. For example, logistic regression and decision trees have become essential tools across various industries, with financial services being one of the most prominent adopters. These models are particularly effective in fraud detection, where they are trained on preclassified historical data—transactions that have already been labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>By analyzing this data, the model learns to identify subtle patterns and anomalies that may suggest fraudulent activity. For example, if a credit card transaction differs significantly from a customer’s typical spending habits or takes place in an unexpected geographic location, the system can flag it for further review. This predictive capability helps protect both consumers and <span class="keep-together">financial</span> institutions, reducing losses and contributing to a more secure banking experience. Similarly, healthcare companies apply supervised learning in medical diagnostics, especially through image classification techniques. These models can analyze medical images, such as scans or X-rays, to help diagnose diseases, offering invaluable support to healthcare professionals in delivering accurate and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="learning methods" data-secondary="supervised learning" data-startref="icd336" data-type="indexterm" id="id875"/>timely <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI lifecycle" data-secondary="learning methods" data-startref="icd328" data-tertiary="supervised learning" data-type="indexterm" id="id876"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="supervised learning" data-startref="icd333" data-type="indexterm" id="id877"/>care.</p>&#13;

Instead, it generates its own labels from the data by predicting missing parts or properties of the data. LLMs and transformers are crucial in self-supervised learning for understanding and generating humanlike text. These models, trained on vast amounts of unlabeled text data, can predict text continuation and generate coherent pieces of text. Self-supervised learning is especially useful for tasks such as natural language understanding, where labeled data can be scarce or expensive to produce.</p>&#13;

<h2>Responsible AI Practices</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Responsible AI practices are essential for ensuring that AI technologies are developed and deployed in ways that prioritize human welfare, fairness, and transparency. For AI PMs, this means embedding ethical considerations into every stage of the product and AI lifecycle. Lead your team by asking critical questions such as “Who will this product impact?” and “What potential harms might arise?”</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When you identify potential risks, leverage ethical frameworks <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="FATE framework" data-type="indexterm" id="id914"/>such as <a href="https://oreil.ly/2__Yz">FATE</a> (fairness, accountability, transparency, ethics) and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI Ethics Canvas" data-type="indexterm" id="id915"/>the <a href="https://oreil.ly/v5YYH">AI Ethics Canvas</a> to guide the choice of algorithms, data collection methods, and model architectures. Don’t stop there; be sure to monitor product performance and social impact metrics to detect and correct bias, errors, or misuse of the product in real-world settings. Regular audits and updates to the model based on ethical guidelines and user feedback are necessary to maintain responsible AI practices throughout the product’s lifecycle.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Proactively identifying risks in AI systems is critical to preventing unintended societal harms, which can range from algorithmic bias to violating privacy and perpetuating stereotypes. You can conduct various risk assessments by evaluating the fairness of datasets, testing for potential biases in model outputs, and conducting scenario analysis to identify unintended use cases. For example, an AI-based hiring tool could unintentionally favor certain demographics if the training data is skewed, leading to discriminatory hiring practices. Similarly, a predictive policing algorithm might disproportionately target minority communities if trained on historically biased data. These risks, if unaddressed, can lead to public backlash, loss of trust, and even regulatory penalties.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can mitigate these risks by creating diverse datasets. AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on, and ensuring that datasets represent a wide range of demographic, geographic, and contextual diversity is essential to minimizing biases. For example, a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="face recognition systems" data-type="indexterm" id="id916"/>face recognition system trained <span class="keep-together">predominantly</span> on images of lighter-skinned individuals may fail to accurately identify darker-skinned individuals, leading to inequitable outcomes. To ensure robustness, AI PMs should stress-test the product using a wide array of <span class="keep-together">edge cases.</span></p>&#13;

<h3>Ethics and compliance</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Compliance<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="regulatory compliance" data-secondary="best practices" data-type="indexterm" id="id917"/> isn’t just about checking boxes; it’s about ensuring that AI products are trustworthy, are ethical, and meet the legal standards that protect users. This means you and your team must prioritize how data is collected, stored, and used; especially when handling sensitive information. The best practice is to anonymize, encrypt, and limit data collection and usage to only what is absolutely necessary to power the product. There are various policies that set guidelines for ethical AI practices. Proactively accounting for regulations such as <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)" data-secondary="proactively accounting for" data-type="indexterm" id="id918"/>GDPR and the AI Act<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act)" data-type="indexterm" id="id919"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="EU AI Act (Artificial Intelligence Act)" data-type="indexterm" id="id920"/> ensures that the products are designed to be transparent and robust.</p>&#13;

<h3>Explainable AI (XAI)</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>XAI is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="XAI (explainable AI)" data-type="indexterm" id="id921"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="explainable AI (XAI)" data-type="indexterm" id="id922"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="explainability of models" data-secondary="explainable AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id923"/> about designing AI systems to be easily understandable to the people who use them. At its core, it ensures that AI decisions don’t feel like they’re coming out of a “black box,” where the user doesn’t know why or how the system reached the decision it provided. XAI is especially important when designing AI products for high-risk situations; for instance, doctors diagnosing patients, financial advisors assessing risk, or customer service systems that interact with users directly. People need to trust the technology. That trust hinges on understanding not just what the AI decided, but also how it got there.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Making AI explainable means implementing methods that can break down algorithms and decisions into human-friendly explanations. For instance, feature importance scores can highlight which factors mattered most to the AI in making a prediction, such as showing that a patient’s age and medical history were key in suggesting a diagnosis. Visualization<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data visualization" data-type="indexterm" id="id924"/> tools, such as decision trees<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="decision trees" data-type="indexterm" id="id925"/> or heatmaps<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="heatmaps" data-type="indexterm" id="id926"/>, can also help demystify the inner workings of complex models. Counterfactual explanations are another useful strategy to communicate what would need to change to achieve a different outcome; for example, “If your income were $5,000 higher, your loan application would be more likely to get approved.” These methods make AI decisions more transparent, helping users and stakeholders understand what’s happening under the hood.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>But explainability isn’t just about the user; it’s a key component for the teams building the technology. Engineers and data scientists rely on XAI techniques to debug and refine models. If something goes wrong, like the AI making biased predictions, explainability tools can quickly pinpoint the issue.
