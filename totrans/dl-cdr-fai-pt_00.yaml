- en: Deep learning is a powerful new technology, and we believe it should be applied
    across many disciplines. Domain experts are the most likely to find new applications
    of it, and we need more people from all backgrounds to get involved and start
    using it.

- en: That’s why Jeremy cofounded fast.ai, to make deep learning easier to use through
    free online courses and software. Sylvain is a research engineer at Hugging Face.
    Previously he was a research scientist at fast.ai and a former mathematics and
    computer science teacher in a program that prepares students for entry into France’s
    elite universities. Together, we wrote this book in the hope of putting deep learning
    into the hands of as many people as possible.

- en: If you are a complete beginner to deep learning and machine learning, you are
    most welcome here. Our only expectation is that you already know how to code,
    preferably in Python.

- en: If you don’t have any experience coding, that’s OK too! The first three chapters
    have been explicitly written in a way that will allow executives, product managers,
    etc. to understand the most important things they’ll need to know about deep learning.
    When you see bits of code in the text, try to look them over to get an intuitive
    sense of what they’re doing. We’ll explain them line by line. The details of the
    syntax are not nearly as important as a high-level understanding of what’s going
    on.

- en: If you are already a confident deep learning practitioner, you will also find
    a lot here. In this book, we will be showing you how to achieve world-class results,
    including techniques from the latest research. As we will show, this doesn’t require
    advanced mathematical training or years of study. It just requires a bit of common
    sense and tenacity.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we said before, the only prerequisite is that you know how to code (a year
    of experience is enough), preferably in Python, and that you have at least followed
    a high school math course. It doesn’t matter if you remember little of it right
    now; we will brush up on it as needed. [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)
    has great free resources online that can help.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are not saying that deep learning doesn’t use math beyond high school level,
    but we will teach you (or direct you to resources that will teach you) the basics
    you need as we cover the subjects that require them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book starts with the big picture and progressively digs beneath the surface,
    so you may need, from time to time, to put it aside and go learn some additional
    topic (a way of coding something or a bit of math). That is completely OK, and
    it’s the way we intend the book to be read. Start browsing it, and consult additional
    resources only as needed.

    Jupyter notebooks (don’t worry; you will learn all about what Jupyter is in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#chapter_intro)).
    This is an interactive version of the book, where you can actually execute the
    code and experiment with it. See the [book’s website](https://book.fast.ai) for
    more information. The website also contains up-to-date information on setting
    up the various tools we present and some additional bonus chapters.

    our reviewers (thanks, Fred!) said that he likes to read the questionnaire *first*,
    before reading the chapter, so he knows what to look out for.
