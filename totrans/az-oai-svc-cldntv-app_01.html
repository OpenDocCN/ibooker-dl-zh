      <h1 class="calibre4">Introduction</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Artificial intelligence is finally here. While it was certainly already among us, we can consider the 2020s as the beginning of a new era for modern, more accessible, and powerful artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p class="subtitle">If you are reading this book, you probably already know that AI is not a new concept. It’s been several decades since its first appearance (at least as a concept, during a very <a href="https://oreil.ly/kk-Ey" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">famous university conference in the United States</a>), and we can now say that people from almost all walks of life are beginning to understand the potential and considerations of artificial intelligence. After several <a href="https://oreil.ly/au2B6" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">AI summers and winters</a> and cycles of hype and deception, the promise of AI value for companies and individuals is finally here, and terms such as generative AI, generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), and <a href="https://oreil.ly/8KuvO" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">large language model (LLM)</a> are everywhere.</p>
      <p class="subtitle">The arrival of AI-enabled tools such as OpenAI’s <a href="https://oreil.ly/HUWak" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://oreil.ly/ercyb" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Midjourney</a>, and the new <a href="https://oreil.ly/NofXj" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Microsoft Copilot</a> engine is facilitating the interaction between people and the algorithms. Even more, the generative AI wave can be considered a democratizing element for mainstream AI adoption, due to its unique value for natural language–based <span class="keep-together">communication.</span></p>
      <p class="subtitle">And this is not only for the general public. Companies, politicians, governments, observatories, startups, etc. are all talking about generative AI, adopting the technologies to improve their services to clients and citizens, analyzing its potential, and thinking about future AI regulations.</p>
      <p class="subtitle">That’s the key difference between then and now: <em class="hyperlink">awareness</em>. Before, AI-enabled capabilities were kept behind the scenes (e.g., face detection and classification engines for image repositories, natural language processing and generation [NLP/NLG], and speech technologies for personal home assistants). Nowadays, most people are aware that behind a GPT type of application, there is a “machine” with AI capabilities and power algorithms. </p>
      <p class="subtitle">And what comes after awareness? Plenty of things depending on the involved actor, but if we observe the typical patterns from companies and startups, mostly learning and understanding the key technology elements, and an unstoppable willingness to adopt<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="artificial intelligence (AI)" data-secondary="adoption of" id="id183" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>. That brings us to <em class="hyperlink">enablement</em>, the key element for adoption. For many years, most organizations could not leverage powerful AI-enabled technologies. That was a privilege reserved for just a few companies and research centers—a bit of an AI aristocracy with important entry barriers for innovation and competition. This is changing though, in many ways thanks to cloud computing. </p>
      <p class="subtitle">Over the last two decades, public clouds<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloud native architectures and applications" data-secondary="public clouds and AI adoption" id="id184" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM, Oracle, and <a href="https://oreil.ly/c5Q1h" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Microsoft Azure</a> have enabled companies around the world to obtain infrastructure capabilities and, depending on the use case, access to very advanced services. In recent years, areas such as big data, AI, and security were the superstars, and the key reasons for adopters to move to the cloud and leverage aaS (as-a-service) capabilities, along with potential <a href="https://oreil.ly/oXxPn" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">financial and scalability reasons</a>.</p>
      <p class="subtitle">Since 2022, generative AI<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="generative AI" data-seealso="implementation of generative AI" id="id185" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Azure OpenAI Service" id="id186" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/> capabilities have suddenly taken the stage. For example, Microsoft Azure incorporated <a href="https://oreil.ly/XVU1A" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Azure OpenAI Service</a>, a cloud-based platform as a service (PaaS) with enterprise-grade capabilities to leverage generative language, code, and image features (more on this later). This was the first and most advanced option for AI adopters, with a key competitive advantage from OpenAI’s technologies. But you, my avid reader, probably know this already. And that’s why you’re here, looking for a way to apply generative AI by using pre-built models that can be easily customized and integrated via APIs (application programming interfaces) with all the security and moderation advantages a company may need.</p>
      <p class="subtitle">Now it’s time to dig into how to use Azure OpenAI and other Microsoft services to design, build, and integrate cloud native solutions that will solve actual business needs, with clear business cases, that will enable you to deliver high-quality services to your clients and users. If you are here, you certainly understand the cloud advantage, but you need some additional pieces of knowledge and guidance<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="democratization of technology" id="id187" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2"/>. That’s what this book is about—actual AI <em class="hyperlink">democratization</em> (illustrated in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig-i-1" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Figure I-1</a>) for the whole innovation ecosystem. You are (or will be) part of it. Let’s use this book to get you on board.</p>

        <p class="subtitle">This book is an applied guide that contains the technology “building blocks” (managed services that deliver specific value and interconnect with other applications, within an end-to-end AI architecture) related to the implementation of Azure OpenAI–enabled applications. This means you will be learning about technical settings, but also business-related topics, such as return on investment (ROI) and responsible AI.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Last but not least, the reading experience will be complemented with several expert interviews in <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#exploring_the_big_picture" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 calibre6 pcalibre4 pcalibre2">Chapter 7</a>. Generative AI and Azure OpenAI are rapidly evolving topics, so I want this book to become a living resource for your next professional projects.</p>
