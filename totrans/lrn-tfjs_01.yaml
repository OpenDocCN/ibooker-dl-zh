    X” or “If only I had applied at startup Y before they became famous.” The world
    is replete with moments that define us for better or worse. Time never goes backward,
    but it echoes the lessons of our younger choices as we go forward. You’re lucky
    enough to have this book and this moment to decide.

    The changes will ultimately be decided by those who grab hold and shape the world
    into what it will be tomorrow. Machine learning is an adventure into new possibilities,
    and when it is unified with the broad exposure of JavaScript, the limits drift
    away.

- en: TensorFlow is one of the most popular machine learning frameworks on the market.
    It’s supported by Google’s top minds and is responsible for powering many of the
    world’s most influential companies. TensorFlow.js is the indomitable JavaScript
    framework of TensorFlow and is better than all the competitors. In short, if you
    want the power of a framework in JavaScript, there’s only one choice that can
    do it all.

    before, this book will be your guide. It leans into the framework to keep you
    active in pragmatic and exciting creations. You’ll comprehend the basics of machine
    learning with hands-on experience through the construction of all kinds of projects.
    While we won’t shy away from math or deeper concepts, we also won’t overly complicate
    the experience with them. Read this book if you’re building websites in JavaScript
    and want to gain a new superpower.

    skills to JavaScript. Here, you’ll find various core concepts illustrated, displayed,
    and portrayed in the TensorFlow.js framework. This will allow you to apply your
    vast knowledge to a medium that can exist efficiently on edge devices like client
    browsers or the Internet of Things (IoT). Read this book and learn how to bring
    your creations to countless devices with rich interactive experiences.

    create a whirlwind adventure into a variety of applications of machine learning
    and touch on each with small, tangible examples, or I could choose a single path
    that tells an ever-growing story of the concepts. After polling my friends and
    followers, it was clear that the latter was needed. To keep this book sane and
    under a thousand pages, I chose to remove any JavaScript frameworks and to focus
    on a singular pragmatic journey into the visual aspects of AI.
