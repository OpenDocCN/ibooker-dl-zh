<p class="calibre15">In chapter 3, we used Copilot to write several functions for us. What are they good for? Maybe our <code class="calibre25">money_made</code> function could be part of a stock trading system, our <code class="calibre25">is_strong_password</code> function could be used as part of a social networking website, or our <code class="calibre25">best_word</code> function could be used as part of some Scrabble AI. Overall, we’ve written some useful functions that could be part of larger programs. And, we did this without writing much code ourselves or, indeed, understanding what the code even does. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p10">
<p class="calibre15">However, we believe that you need to understand at a high level what code does. Because this will require some time to learn, we’ve split this discussion over two chapters. In this chapter, we’ll explain why reading code is important and introduce you to a Copilot feature that can help you understand the code. After that, we’ll dive into the top 10 programming features you’ll need to recognize to read most basic code produced by Copilot. We’ll do the first five in this chapter and the remaining five in the next chapter. Don’t worry: you’ve actually been informally introduced to all 10 already—we’re just going to deepen your understanding of each one. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p11">
<h2 class="readable-text-h1" id="sigil_toc_id_59"><span class="calibre22">4.1</span> Why we need to read code</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p12">
<p class="calibre15">When we talk about reading code, what we mean is understanding what code does by looking at it. There are two such levels of understanding, and they’re both important.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p13">
<p class="calibre15">The first level is being able to understand, line by line, what a program will do. This often involves tracing the values of variables as the code runs to determine exactly what the code is doing at each step. This is useful, but isn’t the whole story. It’s like following a cooking recipe step-by-step without knowing what the recipe is making or how its ingredients fit together. At the end, you might have a cake, but you might not be able to grasp why the cake turned out so well or how you could come up with such a recipe yourself. You need to understand why the recipe, as a whole, is effective.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p14">
<p class="calibre15">So, that’s the second level: determining the overall purpose of a program. That is, you need to be able to zoom out, away from each line, and understand what the program is doing at a high level.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p15">
<p class="calibre15">At the end of these two chapters, we want you to be able to begin to understand code from Copilot at both of these levels. We’ll start focusing on that line-by-line understanding, but toward the end of this chapter and through the rest of the book, you’ll start being able to look at a small chunk of code and determine its overall purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p16">
<p class="calibre15">We can illustrate the difference between the two levels of reading code by referring back to our <code class="calibre25">best_word</code> function from chapter 3, reprinted in the following listing.</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p17">
<h5 class="listing-container-h"><span>Listing 4.1</span> <code class="calibre25">best_word</code> function for Scrabble</h5>
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area"><strong class="calibre17">def best_word(word_list):</strong>
<strong class="calibre17">    """</strong>
<strong class="calibre17">    word_list is a list of words.</strong>
<strong class="calibre17">    </strong>
<strong class="calibre17">    Return the word worth the most points.</strong>
<strong class="calibre17">    """</strong>
    best_word = ""
    best_points = 0
    for word in word_list:
        points = num_points(word)
        if points &gt; best_points:
            best_word = word
            best_points = points
    return best_word</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p18">
<p class="calibre15">A <em class="calibre18">tracing description</em> of what this program does is a description of each line. For example, we would say that we’re defining a function called <code class="calibre25">best_word</code> that takes one parameter called <code class="calibre25">word_list</code>. We have a variable called <code class="calibre25">best_word</code> that we start off as a string with no characters, otherwise known as the empty string. (It’s unfortunate that the function and this variable are both called <code class="calibre25">best_word</code> because it makes it trickier to refer to one or the other, but that’s what Copilot gave us.) We also have another variable, <code class="calibre25">best_points</code>, that we start at <code class="calibre25">0</code>. Then, we have a <code class="calibre25">for</code> loop over each word in the <code class="calibre25">word_list</code>. Inside the <code class="calibre25">for</code> loop, we call our <code class="calibre25">num_points</code> helper function and store its return value in the points variable, and so on. (We’ll explain how we know what each line of code does over this chapter and the next.)</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p19">
<p class="calibre15">In contrast, a <em class="calibre18">description of the overall purpose</em> would be something like our docstring description: “Return the word with the highest Scrabble point value from a list of words.” Rather than refer to each line, this description refers to the code’s purpose as a whole, explaining what it does at a high level.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p20">
<p class="calibre15">You’ll come to an overall-purpose level of understanding through a combination of practice with tracing and testing, and we hope you arrive there in full glory by the end of the book. Working at a tracing level generally precedes the ability to work at an overall-purpose level [1], so in this chapter and the next, we’re going to focus on the tracing level by understanding what each line of code does. There are three reasons why we want you to be able to read code:</p>
</div>
<ol class="calibre28">
<li class="readable-text1" id="p21"> <em class="calibre18">To help determine whether code is correct —</em>In chapter 3, we practiced how to test the code that Copilot gives us. Testing is a powerful skill for determining whether code does the right thing, and we’ll continue to use it throughout the book. But many programmers, the two of us included, will only test something if it seems plausibly correct. If we can determine by inspection that the code is wrong, then we won’t bother to test it: we’ll try to fix the code first. Similarly, we want you to identify when code is simply wrong without having to spend time testing it. The more code that you can identify as wrong (through quick tracing or honing your overall-purpose skills), the more time you save testing broken code. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p22"> <em class="calibre18">To inform testing —</em>Understanding what the code is doing line by line is useful on its own, but it also helps turbocharge your ability to test effectively. For example, in the next chapter, you’ll learn about loops—that they can cause your code to repeat zero times, one time, two times, or as many times as needed. You’ll be able to combine that knowledge with what you already know about testing to help you identify important categories of cases to test. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p23"> <em class="calibre18">To help you write code —</em>We know, you want Copilot to write all of your code! We want that too. But inevitably, there will be code that Copilot just doesn’t get right, no matter how much prompt engineering you do. Or maybe enough prompt engineering could finally cajole Copilot to write the correct code, but it would be simpler and faster to just do it ourselves. In writing this book, the two of us strive to have Copilot write as much code as possible. But, because of our knowledge of Python programming, we’re often able to see a mistake and just fix it without going through any hoops to have Copilot fix it for us. Longer term, we want you to be empowered to learn more programming on your own, and having an understanding of Python is our way to provide a bridge for you from this book to other resources later. There is research evidence that being able to trace and explain code is prerequisite to being able to write code [1]. </li>
</ol>
<div class="readable-text" id="p24">
<p class="calibre15">Before we get to it, we need to be clear about the level of depth that we’re striving for. We’re not going to teach you every nuance of every line of code. Doing so would revert us back to the traditional way programming was taught prior to tools like Copilot. Rather, through a combination of Copilot tools and our own explanations, we’re going to help you understand the gist or overall goal of each line of code. You’ll need more than this if you endeavor to write large portions of programs in the future. We’re trying to target the sweet spot between “this code is magic” and “I know exactly how every line of the code works.”</p>

<h2 class="readable-text-h1" id="sigil_toc_id_60"><span class="calibre22">4.2</span> Asking Copilot to explain code</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p26">
<p class="calibre15">To this point, we’ve used Copilot to generate code for us. That’s its most well-known feature, but it’s not the only one. We’re going to show you another of its best features right now: explaining what Python code does!</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p27">
<p class="calibre15">The Copilot extension is always changing. The specific steps we give here may vary somewhat, and, in that case, we encourage you to consult more general GitHub Copilot documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p28">
<p class="calibre15">To try the Explain feature, you need to highlight some code that you want Copilot to describe to you. Let’s try this with our <code class="calibre25">best_word</code> function (listing 4.1). If you don’t have this code typed in from chapter 3, please enter it now.<span/></p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p29">

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p30">
<p class="calibre15">Highlight the code as in figure 4.1. After this, we have a few options. The first is to click the Chat icon in the Activity Bar (on the left-hand side of VS Code), or press Ctrl-Alt-I. This will open the Copilot Chat interface, as in figure 4.2. (There are other interfaces for Chat, including a Quick Chat that you can open with Ctrl-Shift-I—it doesn’t matter which chat interface you use.) Copilot Chat is able to respond to your questions not only with natural language but also with blocks of code, buttons/links that you can click to invoke commands, and more. It also suggests questions that you may wish to ask and, of course, allows you to type whatever code-related questions you like.<span/></p>
</div>

<img alt="figure" src="../Images/4-2.png" class="calibre51"/>
<h5 class="figure-container-h"><span>Figure 4.2</span> Copilot Chat interface in VS Code</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p32">
<p class="calibre15">For now, we’ll use Copilot Chat to explain the code. In the text box, type the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p33">
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area">/explain</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p34">
<p class="calibre15">If Copilot asks, you want the @workspace option. If this doesn’t work for you, you can also try this command:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p35">
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area">/explain how the selected code works</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p36">
<p class="calibre15">Typing a forward slash (/) is how you tell Copilot Chat that you’re specifying a command (Copilot documentation refers to these as slash commands), rather than natural language. In this case, we’re asking for the <code class="calibre25">/explain</code> command to be run by Copilot for the selected text. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p37">
<p class="calibre15">Alternatively, you could ask Copilot to explain the code by highlighting the code in the function just like in figure 4.1. Then, right-click the code in the function, and you’ll see the menu that appears in figure 4.3.<span/></p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p38">

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p39">
<p class="calibre15">In this menu, highlight Copilot, and you’ll see the list of options shown in figure 4.4. These options are the more commonly used features with Copilot.<span/></p>

<h5 class="figure-container-h"><span>Figure 4.4</span> A list of options that you can use with Copilot</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p41">
<p class="calibre15">The last step is to select the Explain This option. The Copilot Chat window will open (as shown earlier in figure 4.2), and you’ll get an explanation of the code. As usual, Copilot is nondeterministic, so your results will likely differ from ours. In fact, if an explanation is confusing you, you might try the <code class="calibre25">/explain</code> command again or writing your own prompt to get a different explanation. As educators, this is the start of a dream come true, where learners will be able to ask for as many explanations as they need to fully understand how code works.</p>
</div>
<div class="callout-container">
<div class="readable-text" id="p42">
<h5 class="callout-container-h">Copilot explanations can be wrong </h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p43">
<p class="calibre15">As with the code produced by Copilot, the explanations from Copilot can be wrong too. You might be thinking, “Wait, what’s the value of a tool to understand code if it can be wrong?!” First, we agree that this can be really frustrating. However, Copilot’s explanations are right often enough in our experience that they can be really helpful, particularly for understanding code basics such as the things we’re teaching in these two chapters. Moreover, what learners historically did when they were confused about their code was to ask friends or websites about the code, which can lead to mistakes too. A way to help mitigate the potential for error is to ask Copilot for its explanation a couple of times because you’re less likely to get grossly incorrect answers across multiple tries.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p44">
<p class="calibre15">Here’s what Copilot gave us the first time we asked:</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text4" id="p45">
<p class="calibre54">The provided Python code defines a function named <code class="calibre25">best_word</code> that takes a list of words as an argument (<code class="calibre25">word_list</code>). The purpose of this function is to determine and return the word from the list that is worth the most points. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text4" id="p46">
<p class="calibre54">The function starts by initializing two variables: <code class="calibre25">best_word</code> and <code class="calibre25">best_points</code>. <code class="calibre25">best_word</code> is an empty string that will eventually hold the word with the highest point value, while <code class="calibre25">best_points</code> is set to 0 and will hold the highest point value found.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text4" id="p47">
<p class="calibre54">The function then enters a loop where it iterates over each word in the <code class="calibre25">word_list</code>. For each word, it calculates the point value of the word by calling the <code class="calibre25">num_points</code> function (not shown in the provided code). The <code class="calibre25">num_points</code> function presumably takes a word as an argument and returns its point value.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text4" id="p48">
<p class="calibre54">If the point value of the current word is greater than the current <code class="calibre25">best_points</code>, the function updates <code class="calibre25">best_word</code> to be the current word and <code class="calibre25">best_points</code> to be the points of the current word. This way, the function always keeps track of the word with the highest point value.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text4" id="p49">
<p class="calibre54">After the loop has iterated over all the words in the list, the function returns <code class="calibre25">best_word</code>, which at this point should be the word with the highest point value from the list. If the list is empty or all words have a point value of 0, the function will return an empty string.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p50">
<p class="calibre15">To us, this is an excellent description of what the code does. It starts with an overall explanation of the code, and then proceeds to give more of a line-by-line explanation. Notice, however, to make full sense of it, you need to know important Python terminology and features. The explanation from Copilot refers to functions, arguments, variables, strings, loops, making decisions (“If the point value”), and returning. This explanation is quite useful if you understand the terminology, but much less useful if you don’t. By the end of this and the next chapter, you’ll know the main terminology and features of Python that you need to interpret a typical explanation from Copilot.</p>
</div>
<div class="callout-container">
<div class="readable-text" id="p51">
<h5 class="callout-container-h">Asking for explanations</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p52">
<p class="calibre15">The type of explanation that you get from the <code class="calibre25">/explain</code> command may not meet your requirements. For example, suppose that you want Copilot to explicitly give you each line of code and explain what it does, so that you can more easily connect the code to its specific explanation. You can make that happen! Try this prompt: “Explain that code again, but do it line by line. Give each line of code and the explanation of what it does.” Doing so gave us a very detailed breakdown of each line of code, followed by its explanation. We encourage you to craft your own prompts if built-in commands aren’t giving you the level of detail that you want. </p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p54">
<p class="calibre15">We’re going to give you a whirlwind tour of the 10 Python features that you’ll need for the rest of your programming journey, starting with the first five of those in this chapter. Python is an interactive language, which makes it easier than other languages for us to play around with and see what stuff does. We’ll take advantage of that here as we explore programming features. This is how the two of us learned Python and how many thousands of programmers have done so. Don’t hesitate to experiment! To get started, press Ctrl–Shift–P and type <code class="calibre25">REPL</code>, and then select Python: Start REPL. This should result in the situation shown in figure 4.5. (REPL stands for read-execute-print-loop. It’s called that because Python reads what you type, executes/runs it, prints the results back to you, and does all of this over and over in a loop.)<span/></p>

<img alt="figure" src="../Images/4-5.png" class="calibre55"/>
<h5 class="figure-container-h"><span>Figure 4.5</span> Starting REPL from VS Code</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p56">

<h5 class="figure-container-h"><span>Figure 4.6</span> REPL running in VS Code</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p58">
<p class="calibre15">Then, we can start typing Python code. For example, type</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p59">
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area">&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 * 4</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p60">
<p class="calibre15">and press Enter. You’ll see the response of <code class="calibre25">20</code>. We won’t spend time on simple math here, but the way you interact with Python to learn how it works is exactly the same: you type some code, and Python responds. Now, let’s jump into the first five of those 10 Python features we mentioned.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p61">
<h3 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_62"><span class="calibre22">4.3.1</span> #1. Functions</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p62">
<p class="calibre15">You learned all about functions in chapter 3, so let’s just summarize what we learned. You use functions to break a large problem into smaller pieces. In retrospect, that <code class="calibre25">best_word</code> function we wrote in chapter 3 is a pretty big task: it has to figure out which word in a list of words is worth the most points. How many points is a word worth? Aha—that’s a subtask that we can carve out from this function, which we did in our earlier <code class="calibre25">num_points</code> function.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p63">
<p class="calibre15">We design a function to take parameters, one parameter for each piece or collection of data that the function needs to do its job. After doing their work, most functions use <code class="calibre25">return</code> to send the answer back to the line of code that called them. When we call a function, we pass values, known as arguments, with one value for each parameter, and we often store that return value using a variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p64">
<p class="calibre15">For each program we write, we’ll likely need to design a few functions, but there are also some functions that are built-in to Python that we get for free. We can call those like we call our own functions. For example, there’s a built-in <code class="calibre25">max</code> function that takes one or more arguments and tells us the largest:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p65">
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area">&gt;&gt;&gt; max(5, 2, 8, 1)
8</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p66">
<p class="calibre15">There’s also the <code class="calibre25">input</code> function, which we used in our <code class="calibre25">get_strong_password</code> function from chapter 3. It takes an argument that becomes the prompt to the user, and it returns whatever the user types at the keyboard:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p67">
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area">&gt;&gt;&gt; name = input("What is your name? ")
What is your name? Dan
&gt;&gt;&gt; name
'Dan'</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p68">
<p class="calibre15">If <code class="calibre25">input</code> is the function to receive input from the keyboard, is there an <code class="calibre25">output</code> function to output a message to the screen? Well, yes, but it’s called <code class="calibre25">print</code>, not <code class="calibre25">output</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p69">
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area">&gt;&gt;&gt; print('Hello', name)
Hello Dan</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p70">
<h3 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_63"><span class="calibre22">4.3.2</span> #2. Variables</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p71">
<p class="calibre15">A variable is a name that refers to a value. We used variables in chapter 3 to keep track of <code class="calibre25">return</code> values from functions. We also just used a variable here to hold the user’s name. Whenever we need to remember a value for later, we use a variable. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p72">
<p class="calibre15">To assign a value to a variable, we use the = (equals sign) symbol, which is called the <em class="calibre18">assignment</em> symbol. It figures out the value of whatever is on the right and then assigns that to the variable:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p73">
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area">&gt;&gt;&gt; age = 20 + 4     <span/> #1
&gt;&gt;&gt; age
24</pre>
<div class="code-annotations-overlay-container">
     #1 The right-hand side of the = symbol is evaluated, which means 20 + 4 is evaluated to be 24. Then, the variable age is assigned the value of 24.
     <br class="calibre1"/>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-container">
<div class="readable-text" id="p74">
<h5 class="callout-container-h">The = symbol is different in Python than in math </h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p75">
<p class="calibre15">The = sign is used in Python and other programming languages to denote <em class="calibre18">assignment</em>.

<p class="calibre15">The <code class="calibre25">if-else</code> structure in listing 4.2 is known as a <em class="calibre18">conditional</em> statement, and it allows our program to make decisions. Here, if <code class="calibre25">num1</code> is greater than <code class="calibre25">num2</code>, then <code class="calibre25">num1</code> is returned; otherwise, <code class="calibre25">num2</code> is returned.

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p89">
<p class="calibre15">After <code class="calibre25">if</code>, we put a Boolean condition (<code class="calibre25">num1</code> <code class="calibre25">&gt;</code> <code class="calibre25">num2</code>). A Boolean condition is an expression that tests a condition where the result would either be <code class="calibre25">True</code> or <code class="calibre25">False</code>. If it’s <code class="calibre25">True</code>, then the code under the <code class="calibre25">if</code> runs; if it’s <code class="calibre25">False</code>, then the code under the <code class="calibre25">else</code> runs. We create Boolean expressions using comparison symbols such as <code class="calibre25">&gt;=</code> for greater than or equal to, <code class="calibre25">&lt;</code> for less than, &gt; for greater than, == for equal to, and <code class="calibre25">!=</code> for not equal to. Notice that we’re using indentation not only for the code of the function but also for the code of the <code class="calibre25">if</code> and <code class="calibre25">else</code> parts of the <code class="calibre25">if-else</code> statement. Indentation is necessary for the code to function properly, so it’s worth paying attention to (we talk more about indentation in the next chapter).

<p class="calibre15">We’re using <code class="calibre25">and</code> to capture a complex condition. For example, in the first line, we want age to be greater than or equal to 30 and less than or equal to 39. Python works from top to bottom, and when it finds a condition that’s true, it runs the corresponding indented code. Then, it stops checking the remaining <code class="calibre25">elif</code>s or <code class="calibre25">else</code>—so if two conditions happened to be true, only the code for the first one would run. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p103">
<p class="calibre15">Try experimenting with various values for the age variable to observe that the correct code runs in each case. In fact, if we were serious about testing this code, we could use the <code class="calibre25">if</code> statement structure for a good sense of the values we’d want to test. It’s all about testing the boundaries of values. For example, we definitely want to test the ages 30 and 39 to make sure, for example, that we’re correctly capturing the full 30–39 range with the first condition. Similarly, we’d want to test 20, 29, 10, 19, 0, 9, and then something larger than 39 to test the <code class="calibre25">else</code> way at the bottom.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p104">
<p class="calibre15">If you use additional <code class="calibre25">if</code>s rather than <code class="calibre25">elif</code>s, then they become separate <code class="calibre25">if</code> statements, rather than a single <code class="calibre25">if</code> statement.

<div class="readable-text" id="p118">
<p class="calibre15">Remember that we can ask Copilot to explain code, as we demonstrated in section 4.2. Here’s what we got when we asked Copilot to explain this code:</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text4" id="p119">
<p class="calibre54">The provided Python code defines a function named <code class="calibre25">clean_number</code>. This function is designed to take a single argument, <code class="calibre25">phone_number</code>, which is expected to be a string representing a phone number. The purpose of this function is to remove certain characters from the phone number string, specifically parentheses “(” and “)” and hyphens “-”.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text4" id="p120">
<p class="calibre54">The function uses the <code class="calibre25">replace()</code> method, which is a built-in method in Python for strings. The <code class="calibre25">replace()</code> method replaces a specified phrase with another specified phrase. It takes two arguments: the first is the substring that needs to be replaced, and the second is the substring that will replace the first substring.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text4" id="p121">
<p class="calibre54">In this function, the <code class="calibre25">replace()</code> method is called three times on <code class="calibre25">phone_number</code>. Each call to <code class="calibre25">replace()</code> is used to remove one type of character: first the open parenthesis “(”, then the close parenthesis “)”, and finally the hyphen “-”. It does this by replacing these characters with an empty string "", effectively removing them.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text4" id="p122">
<p class="calibre54">After all replacements are done, the cleaned <code class="calibre25">phone_number</code> is returned by the function. This will be a string containing the digits of the phone number without any parentheses or hyphens.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text4" id="p123">
<p class="calibre54">This function could be useful in situations where you need to process or store phone numbers in a consistent, character-free format. For example, you might want to remove these characters when storing phone numbers in a database, or when comparing phone numbers for equality.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p124">
<p class="calibre15">That confirms what this function does: removes parentheses and hyphens from a phone number string. And it uses the <code class="calibre25">replace</code> method to do so. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p125">
<p class="calibre15">Wait—“replace” sounds like we’re changing some characters to some other characters (replacing them), not removing them. How is <code class="calibre25">replace</code> able to remove characters for us, then? The explanation said, “It does this by replacing these characters with an empty string "", effectively removing them.” That’s a clue to how <code class="calibre25">replace</code> is doing this, but we might want to know more. We therefore next used the prompt “How does the replace method use the empty string to remove characters?” and received the following explanation from Copilot:</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text4" id="p126">
<p class="calibre54">The <code class="calibre25">replace()</code> method in Python replaces all occurrences of a specified substring in the string it’s called on with another specified substring. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text4" id="p127">
<p class="calibre54">In this case, the specified substrings are the characters “(”, “)”, and “-”. The method is called on the <code class="calibre25">phone_number</code> string, and the second argument to <code class="calibre25">replace()</code> is an empty string "". </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text4" id="p128">
<p class="calibre54">So, what happens is that every occurrence of the specified character in <code class="calibre25">phone_number</code> is replaced with an empty string. This effectively removes that character from the string, because replacing something with nothing is equivalent to removing it. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text4" id="p129">
<p class="calibre54">This is done three times in the <code class="calibre25">clean_number</code> function, once for each character that needs to be removed. After all three characters have been removed, the cleaned <code class="calibre25">phone_number</code> is returned.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p130">
<p class="calibre15">And if you wanted to learn even more, you could continue asking Copilot questions or do your own testing at the Python prompt. For example, you could verify that <code class="calibre25">replace</code> removes all (, ), and - characters, even if there are multiples of each. And you could explore using <code class="calibre25">replace</code> to actually replace characters (its typical use case), rather than removing them. This kind of exploration is also helpful if we need to separate truth from bits of incorrect information that Copilot may provide. This is why we need a baseline of our own Python knowledge!</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p131">
<p class="calibre15">You’ll also often see what look like mathematical operators being used on strings. They are the same as math symbols, but they do different things on strings. The + operator is used to put two strings together, and the * operator is used to repeat a string a specific number of times. Examples are shown here:</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container" id="p132">
<div class="readable-text">
<pre class="code-area">&gt;&gt;&gt; first = 'This is a '
&gt;&gt;&gt; second = 'sentence.'
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence = first + second     <span/> #1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(sentence)
This is a sentence.
&gt;&gt;&gt; print('-=' * 5)    <span/> #2

<div class="code-annotations-overlay-container">
     #1 Combines first and second strings and assigns result to sentence

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p134">
<p class="calibre15">A <em class="calibre18"/>string is great when we have a sequence of characters, such as a password or a single Scrabble word. But sometimes, we need to store many words or many numbers. For that, we need a list. We used a list in chapter 3 for the <code class="calibre25">best_word</code> function because that function needed to work with a list of individual words.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p135">
<p class="calibre15">Whereas we use quotation marks to start and end a string, we use opening and closing square brackets to start and end a list. And, as for strings, there are many methods available on lists. To give you an idea of the kinds of list methods available and what they do, let’s explore some of these: </p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p137">
<p class="calibre15">Many Python types, including strings and lists, allow you to work with particular values using an <em class="calibre18">index</em>. You need to use indices whenever you want to work with part of a string or list rather than the whole thing. An index is just a number that identifies an element. Indices start at 0 for the first element and go up to, but not including, the number of values. The first value has index 0 (not index 1!), the second has index 1, the third has index 2, and so on. The last value in the list is at the index, which is the length of the list minus 1. The length of the list can be determined by using the <code class="calibre25">len</code> function. For example, if we do <code class="calibre25">len(books)</code>, we’ll get a value of <code class="calibre25">4</code> (so the valid indices are from 0 up to and including 3). People also often use negative indices, which provides another way to index each value: the rightmost value has index –1, the value to its left has index –2, and so on. Figure 4.7 depicts this example with both positive and negative indexing.<span/></p>

<p class="calibre54">The first line of the code uses the <code class="calibre25">input()</code> function to prompt the user to enter their age.

<p class="calibre54">The rest of the code is a series of conditional statements that check the value of age and print out a corresponding message. The <code class="calibre25">if</code> statement checks if the age is less than 13, and if so, it prints “You are a child.” If the age is not less than 13, the program moves to the next condition, the <code class="calibre25">elif</code> (short for <code class="calibre25">else</code> <code class="calibre25">if</code>) statement, which checks if the age is less than 20. If so, it prints “You are a teenager.” If the age is not less than 20, it moves to the next <code class="calibre25">elif</code> statement, which checks if the age is less than 60.

<div class="readable-text4" id="p175">
<p class="calibre54">The code involves manipulating a string stored in text by finding a specific word and replacing it with another word. It uses methods to locate where the word starts and then constructs a new string where the word has been replaced. Finally, it prints out the modified string.</p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p176">
<p class="calibre15">Your task is to do the following:</p>
<ol class="calibre58">
<li class="calibre30">Identify why the initial prompt might lead to a vague or unhelpful explanation.</li>
<li class="calibre30">Improve the prompt to ensure a more detailed and specific explanation from Copilot. Consider what you specifically don’t understand about the string methods and how the code uses them.</li>
<li class="calibre30">Write the revised prompt to Copilot, and discuss how your changes will lead to a better explanation.</li>

<li class="readable-text1" id="p178"> We need to be able to read code to determine whether it’s correct, test it effectively, and write our own code when needed. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p179"> Copilot can provide line-by-line explanations of code to explain what the code is doing, and you can use your own prompt to influence the type of explanation you get. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p180"> Python has built-in functions such as <code class="calibre25">max</code>, <code class="calibre25">input</code>, and <code class="calibre25">print</code> that we call just like we call our own functions. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p181"> A variable is a name that refers to a value. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p182"> An assignment statement makes a variable refer to a specific value. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p183"> An <code class="calibre25">if</code> statement is used to have our programs make decisions and proceed down one of multiple paths. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p184"> A string is used to store and manipulate text. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p185"> A method is a function associated with a particular type. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p186"> A list is used to store and manipulate a general sequence of values (e.g., a sequence of numbers or a sequence of strings). </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p187"> Each value in a string or list has an index; indexing starts at 0, not 1. </li>
<li class="readable-text1" id="p188"> Strings are immutable (not changeable); lists are mutable (changeable). </li>
