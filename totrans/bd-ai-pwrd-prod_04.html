<p>I hope it’s clear to you by now that the central role of an AI PM is to orchestrate AI innovation and seamlessly integrate it into user experiences. But let’s put that role into the broader context of an organization. Where exactly do you fit in as an AI PM, and how will your responsibilities shift as you move up the ladder?</p>

<h1>The AI PM Career Ladder</h1>

<p>A successful AI product strategy hinges on aligning the AI product vision and road map with the company’s overall business objectives. The work of AI PMs can vary significantly depending on their level within the organization. This brings us to <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_1_1736793247311730">Figure 4-1</a>, a high-level map of AI product management tasks across different levels inspired by larger organizations. As you explore it, identify where your current role aligns to understand what a successful product approach could look like for you and your team. Keep in mind, however, that these levels are meant for illustrative purposes. Roles and responsibilities can vary widely from company to company, and your specific role may be a blend of several <span class="keep-together">management</span> levels.</p>

<p>Let’s break down what we see in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_1_1736793247311730">Figure 4-1</a>. The left column outlines the different levels within AI product management, ranging from hands-on execution at levels 4 and 5 to company-wide strategy at levels 9 and above, as well as the tasks and strategic focus for each.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_2_1736793247311766">Figure 4-2</a> complements the information shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_1_1736793247311730">Figure 4-1</a> by breaking down the scope and focus areas for each level in more detail. For example, at levels 4 and 5, the emphasis is on monitoring AI model performance and ensuring data quality. This reflects the on-the-ground nature of execution-level roles. As you move up, the focus shifts to developing strategy, prioritizing use cases, and managing the AI deployment pipeline, indicating a transition toward shaping how AI will drive business goals.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Execution-Level AI Product Management (Levels 4–6)" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_execution_level_ai_product_management_levels_4_6_1736793247322636">
<h2>Execution-Level AI Product Management (Levels 4–6)</h2>

<p>We<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="execution-level AI product management" data-type="indexterm" id="id929"/> start at the execution level, which typically includes associate product managers (APMs) up to group PMs. If you find yourself in this layer, your focus is on the day-to-day development and deployment of AI products and features. You’re the one working closely with AI/ML engineers and data scientists, tracking progress, removing roadblocks, and shipping AI capabilities. At this stage, your work revolves around setting Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), identifying product–market fit, and pushing through the product development cycle.</p>

<p>Look at the tasks listed in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_2_1736793247311766">Figure 4-2</a> for levels 4 through 6. Here, you see responsibilities such as monitoring AI model performance and ensuring data quality—key areas where execution-level AI PMs spend much of their time. For example, if you’re building a personalized <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="content recommendation systems" data-secondary="execution-level AI PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id930"/>content recommendation system (as we briefly discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03_essential_ai_pm_knowledge_1736793246808259">Chapter 3</a>) for a platform like Netflix <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Netflix" data-type="indexterm" id="id931"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="video streaming services" data-secondary="execution-level AI product management" data-type="indexterm" id="id932"/>(as mentioned in the figure), your work will involve close collaboration with engineers to develop, test, and refine the algorithms that drive those recommendations.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="AI/ML Product Management (Levels 5–7)" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_ai_ml_product_management_levels_5_7_1736793247322703">
<h2>AI/ML Product Management (Levels 5–7)</h2>

<p>Moving<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI/ML product management" data-type="indexterm" id="id933"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ML (machine learning)" data-secondary="AI/ML product management" data-type="indexterm" id="id934"/> up a bit, AI/ML PMs play a critical role in defining product requirements, prioritizing the road map, and coordinating execution. They are responsible for driving individual AI product development from ideation through to deployment. Here, your job extends beyond simply building the product; it involves understanding the business goals and translating them into actionable AI strategies.</p>

<p>According to <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_2_1736793247311766">Figure 4-2</a>, at levels 6 and 7 you start setting the multiyear AI product vision and defining the supporting data and infrastructure strategy. Take the example of Pfizer <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Pfizer" data-type="indexterm" id="id935"/>leading the development of an <a href="https://oreil.ly/NHoxe">AI-powered drug discovery platform</a>; this kind of role requires aligning the AI product strategy with research and commercial teams, ensuring that the AI platform accelerates time to market. It’s about balancing technical capabilities with long-term business objectives.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Strategic Leadership (Levels 8+)" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_strategic_leadership_levels_8_1736793247322764">
<h2>Strategic Leadership (Levels 8+)</h2>

<p>As <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic leadership" data-type="indexterm" id="id936"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="leadership and collaboration skills" data-secondary="strategic leadership" data-type="indexterm" id="id937"/>you rise in seniority, your responsibilities shift from hands-on product development to setting the product strategy and leading the organization. Working at Meta <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Meta" data-secondary="role consolidation" data-type="indexterm" id="id938"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Google" data-secondary="role consolidation" data-type="indexterm" id="id939"/>and Google, I’ve observed how big tech companies have trended toward consolidating roles. The ladder becomes shorter as companies focus on having a small number of senior leaders who define the product direction and vision (top layers) and select managers who handle execution (bottom layers).</p>

<p>When you hit levels 8 and above, the focus is on aligning AI products with the overall business strategy and managing an entire AI product portfolio. This involves a lot of cross-functional work, ensuring that AI efforts are strategically aligned with company goals, governance policies, ethics, and compliance. For example, Google oversees its AI initiatives across a diverse suite of products (Assistant, Search, Maps, Translate, etc.), ensuring that data practices align with regulatory standards.</p>

<p>At the very top (levels 9+), you may step into roles such as head of AI Product or chief AI officer. In positions such as these, you’re not just managing individual products. You’re shaping the entire company’s AI vision at scale. This level of leadership involves embedding AI across all units of the company, securing multibillion-dollar investments, and establishing company-wide responsible AI governance frameworks. The responsibilities here include ethical considerations, ensuring that data practices are compliant, and maintaining the integrity of AI models. The difference between these levels isn’t just in scope; it’s also in the strategic mindset required.</p>

<p>By understanding these levels, you can better map out where you currently stand and where you might want to go. Maybe you’re at the execution level, working closely with engineers to build AI-driven features. Or perhaps you’re moving toward shaping an AI product vision that aligns with the company’s broader strategy.</p>

<p>The key takeaway is that your role as an AI PM will evolve, expanding from developing specific features to setting company-wide AI initiatives. But remember, these levels and responsibilities are a guide, not a strict hierarchy. Your journey might look different depending on your organization’s structure and goals.</p>

<dt>What was your path to AI product <br/>management?</dt>

<dd><p>My path to product management was unorthodox. I’m a trained archaeologist and earned my PhD studying changes in human behavior in ancient Mexico and Peru. In those cultures, knowledge was power. For instance, the Maya were able to accurately predict solar eclipses, but the information was held in the hands of a few elites. Their ability to tell the populace that next week during the middle of the day, the sun would disappear and the stars would come out, and it actually happened, was enough for the townspeople to believe that their leaders spoke with the gods and validated their power.</p>

<p>The advent of smartphones democratized knowledge in a way that was never before possible. All of a sudden we all had access to all of the world’s knowledge, wherever we are, 24/7, and basically for free (or at least it’s available for the masses).</p>

<p>Recognizing that we were entering a watershed moment in human history, I elbowed my way into a startup and became a Mobile product manager. The advances we are seeing with AI, and generative AI <span class="keep-together">specifically</span>, feel like we are entering another watershed moment, which is why I leaned hard into the growing field of AI.</p></dd>


<dt>Describe a day in your life as an AI product leader.</dt>

<dd><p>I spend many of my days spreading awareness about the current capabilities of AI for product management, and the potential impact on the future. In only a few short years, AI has changed the game for product managers. Right now it’s impacting not only what people are building, but how they are building. In 2023 and 2024, most companies have focused on integrating some aspect of AI into their products, largely to fulfill consumer demand and expectations. This has caused a number of folks in the field to contemplate new trade-offs in their product decision-making process, such as speed versus accuracy.</p>

<p>As I’m writing this in mid-2024, AI has made small improvements to product managers’ daily tasks, from leveraging <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenAI" data-secondary="ChatGPT" data-type="indexterm" id="id942"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-type="indexterm" id="id943"/>ChatGPT to help create user stories, to summarizing meeting notes and quickly translating them into Jira tasks. It’s a cliché at this point, but an AI-enabled product manager will beat out one who doesn’t leverage AI. Ironically, those who are not keeping up for fear that AI will replace them may actually be the first <span class="keep-together">to go</span>.</p></dd>


<dt>What do you want people coming into the field to know?</dt>

<dd><p>My advice for someone who is coming into the field is to lean in. We are still very much in the infancy of AI’s impact on software development, product development, and our lives in general.</p>

<p>In early 2023, there were only a handful of folks who were truly experienced in AI product management (<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Nika, Marily" data-type="indexterm" id="id944"/>Marily Nika being one of them). As of mid-2024 there are more, but few with more than a year under their belt. A mentor of mine once provided sage advice: “If you focus on a new field, you can quickly find yourself becoming a top voice.”</p>

<p>AI has already made significant impacts on our personal and professional lives. It will only continue to do so, likely at a pace the likes of which we have never seen. Earlier in human history tens of generations could go by with little or no technological innovations. The tectonic shifts in AI are moving so rapidly that every six months, fundamental changes are coming out. There’s never been a more exciting time to build digital products. We are literally shaping the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI PMs (AI product managers)" data-secondary="profiles of" data-startref="icd405" data-tertiary="Cole, Ethan" data-type="indexterm" id="id945"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Cole, Ethan" data-startref="icd406" data-type="indexterm" id="id946"/>future!</p></dd>

<dl>
<dt>What was your path to AI product <br/>management?</dt>

<dd><p>My path to AI product management is perhaps circuitous. I have an electrical engineering degree and began my career as an engineer but, after a couple years, went to business school. I felt isolated as an engineer and desired a role with more human interaction, so I went into business development and sales. That, however, turned out to be too much human contact, and I missed the technology. After a few years I settled into product management, which I feel has been an excellent fit for my skills and personality.</p>

<p>After founding a company with a heavy algorithmic focus (we built technology that significantly improved the relevance of Google’s search results), I really returned to my roots. I got back into programming and then, in 2017, ran across an ad on Facebook for a “deep learning nanodegree” from Udacity<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Udacity" data-type="indexterm" id="id947"/>. I had no idea what a neural network was, but signed myself up on impulse. I was hooked from the first lesson.</p>

<p>I continued to pursue online coursework while experimenting on my own. This eventually led to an AI product management role at PARC<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="PARC" data-type="indexterm" id="id948"/>, the famed research and development laboratory. One of my interviewers mentioned he was impressed by my initiative, so I’m confident this is what got me the job.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, because of my passion for AI and desire to deeply understand the material, I sought ways to continue learning. One day, while staring at Hoover Tower out my office window, I decided to see what programs Stanford<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Stanford University" data-type="indexterm" id="id949"/> might have. A couple years later I received my Graduate Certificate in AI and am now a TA in the program. I also moved to Meta where, as an ML product manager, I’ve been as close to the cutting edge as anyone could hope to be.</p></dd>

<dt>Describe a day in your life as an AI product leader.</dt>

<dd><p>My product management responsibilities at a previous company ran the gamut, from flying around the country to interview prospective customers to working with engineering and design to spec out the PRD. The breadth of the experience was extraordinary and exhilarating. With respect to the AI, however, I spent considerable time with ML research scientists to understand the limits of what was possible as well as conceive a value proposition that would work in an MVP.</p>

<p>My biggest learning might be how difficult it is to scope an MVP for an AI product. I’ve since spoken about this at several conferences. The most substantial hurdle in Andrej Karpathy’s<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Karpathy, Andrej" data-type="indexterm" id="id950"/> “software 2.0” world is that you cannot “know,” <em>a priori</em>, how your application will perform.</p>

<p>Its behavior will depend on many factors, including the volume and quality of the training data. Models in practice can diverge significantly from theory, and many users won’t have the patience to train the systems themselves. It’s difficult to judge without significant experience, so I advise ML product managers to take great care when defining any MVP that’s based on an ML model.</p>

<p>That being said, in the end we pulled together the necessary ML components, sufficiently trained on available data, to launch a product that delivered considerable value to our <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI PMs (AI product managers)" data-secondary="profiles of" data-startref="icd407" data-tertiary="Cramer, Mark" data-type="indexterm" id="id951"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Cramer, Mark" data-startref="icd408" data-type="indexterm" id="id952"/>beta <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI PMs (AI product managers)" data-secondary="profiles of" data-startref="icd402" data-type="indexterm" id="id953"/>partners.</p></dd>

<dt>What was your path to AI product <br/>management?</dt>

<dd><p class="fix_tracking">My path into AI was by “accident.” In 2019 I was admitted to <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Georgia Tech" data-type="indexterm" id="id958"/>Georgia Tech’s master’s program in computer science, and at the same time, I was interviewing with Microsoft for a product manager role that was 90% typical PM role and 10% AI and ML.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Three months after I joined this new role at Microsoft, we were reorganized into a 100% AI and ML team. At that time, Kaggle<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kaggle" data-type="indexterm" id="id959"/>, my classes at Georgia Tech, and working closely with data scientists on my team helped me understand and navigate the complexities of the world of AI and machine learning.</p></dd>

<dt>Describe a day in your life as an AI product leader.</dt>

<dd><p>As an AI product manager, I spend part of my day doing what any other PM would do: working on product requirements documents, looking at data, talking with customers, and checking progress with the engineering and data science team. </p>

<p>What makes my days unique is that I spend time understanding data that we’ll use for our experiments and brainstorming with the data scientists on experiments and metrics, as well as meeting with other stakeholders who want to use machine learning in their products/features. With them, I spend my time understanding the problems they are trying to solve and whether we need machine learning to solve them.</p>

<p>One of the biggest differences in being an AI and ML PM is that, at the beginning of a new project, you spend time looking at what data you’ll use, finding (ideally) responsible AI frameworks to guide your development, understanding whether you really need AI and ML, and thinking about how you and your users will understand and interpret the data.</p></dd>

<dt>What do you want people coming into the field to know?</dt>

<dd><p>Most product management skills are transferable, but for AI and ML, it’s important to understand the technical aspects of machine learning as well as the principles of when and how you need to think about AI and ML for your product.</p>

 <dt>What was your path to AI product <br/>management?</dt>
 
 <dd><p>My path to AI product management has been fueled by a lifelong passion for building. Even during my university years, while pursuing my mechatronics engineering degree at Waterloo, I was drawn to hands-on projects, starting companies and organizations—at one point even designing conveyor systems for the Toronto airport through my own consulting practice. This drive to create continued after graduation, leading me to a role as a PM at Microsoft<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Microsoft" data-secondary="PM" data-type="indexterm" id="id962"/>, where I honed my skills on Outlook. But my heart remained in 0-to-1 environments. That’s why I launched a startup; it ended up going through Y Combinator, and I learned a lot.</p>

<p>While the company inevitably wound down, the experience led me to the Bay Area, where I went back to my PM roots, joining a growing company and helping to build their product team while reporting to one of the founders. Seeking to learn from the best, I joined Google’s Assistant team, leading launches for new speech and camera features, including Continued Conversation<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Google" data-secondary="Continued Conversation" data-type="indexterm" id="id963"/> and Face Match<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Google" data-secondary="Face Match" data-type="indexterm" id="id964"/>. This was my entry into AI product management, before the generative AI boom!</p>

<p>After five years and multiple successful launches, I transitioned to Google Labs, where I most recently led product development for the Gemini API<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Google" data-secondary="Gemini" data-type="indexterm" id="id965"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Gemini" data-type="indexterm" id="id966"/> and Google AI Studio for Developers<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Google" data-secondary="AI Studio for Developers" data-type="indexterm" id="id967"/>. Now I’m focused on building new products with generative AI, embracing the thrill of 0-to-1. Part of what I love so much about 0-to-1 projects and the current AI space is working on difficult problems, figuring out whether something is even possible, and navigating around hard constraints on what’s able to be built.</p></dd>


<dt>Describe a day in your life as an AI product leader.</dt>

<dd><p>Google I/O 2024<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Google" data-secondary="I/O 2024" data-type="indexterm" id="id968"/>, where I launched new features for the Gemini API and AI Studio onstage during the Developer Keynote, highlighted just how drastically the pace of AI has accelerated. What used to take months or even years—building, iterating, refining, optimizing—now happens in weeks. Comparing this year to 2019, when I launched Face Match, a more “traditional AI” feature, it’s mind-blowing just how much faster things are moving right now.</p>

<p>This speed means constant learning is key. My typical day includes absorbing information from podcasts, research papers, articles, and more. I also dedicate time to strategic thinking and writing, crafting PRDs, strategy documents, and “thought pieces” to crystallize ideas. Of course, being a PM means meetings—though I aim for maximum efficiency—along with one-on-ones with my team and peers, often opting for “walk and talks.” I also try to attend at least one tech event monthly to stay ahead of the curve and expose myself to how others are thinking about things.</p>

<p>Currently, my focus is split between managing a team of PMs and driving individual product work. This dual role ensures that I’m providing my team with clear direction, validating our road map, and clearing roadblocks, while also staying hands-on with the products we’re building.</p></dd>


<dt>What do you want people coming into the field to know?</dt>

<dd><p>Here’s what I want anyone entering the AI PM field to know: we are still in the incredibly early stages. The difference between you and someone with “years of experience” is likely a matter of months. You absolutely have time to catch up, and even get ahead.</p>

<p>Many of the core tenets of being a great PM still hold true: be relentlessly curious, embrace continuous learning, and deeply understand the problems you’re solving.</p>

<p>That said, two things are especially crucial for aspiring AI PMs. First, embrace relentless learning. AI moves at warp speed, so what’s “best” is constantly evolving. Stay updated on the latest advancements and their product implications. Second, develop a strong “product-level” understanding of AI by getting your hands dirty. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GenAI (generative AI)" data-secondary="required shift in thinking about" data-type="indexterm" id="id969"/>Generative AI is powerful but requires a shift in thinking. It’s not a magic bullet, and these models are probabilistic, not deterministic. Play with different tools, build something, and try integrating AI into your everyday life—recently I tried making a short film using AI, and I learned so much in the process! This hands-on experience is invaluable for understanding the technology’s capabilities, limitations, and potential <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI PMs (AI product managers)" data-secondary="profiles of" data-startref="icd403" data-tertiary="Konzelmann, Jaclyn" data-type="indexterm" id="id970"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Konzelmann, Jaclyn" data-startref="icd404" data-type="indexterm" id="id971"/>applications.</p></dd>

<dt>What was your path to AI product <br/>management?</dt>

<dd><p>It was accidental. I was a quant derivatives trader at PIMCO [Investment Management]<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="PIMCO Investment Management" data-type="indexterm" id="id975"/> and wanted to spend all of my time on deep learning and building social robots. I founded a startup that pivoted from robotic pets to voice chat assistants for recommending financial products, and then shut it down as a profitable startup with not enough growth. I decided that PMing the products was my favorite part and then joined Amazon Music ML<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Amazon" data-secondary="Music ML" data-type="indexterm" id="id976"/>, and later came to Meta Ads Ranking<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Meta" data-secondary="Ads Ranking" data-type="indexterm" id="id977"/> and then GenAI.</p></dd>


<dt>Describe a day in your life as an AI product leader.</dt>

<dd><p>I have my plan for Monday through Wednesday, my top priorities. I have blocked out time for deep work and reading, and a chaotic mess of meetings around that to learn about needs from customers, partners, leadership, and others. I try to read between two and five AI papers a week, very efficiently, and this takes effort to keep the time for it. I’m constantly prioritizing which meetings to attend when I’m double- or triple-booked (whether I can add value, or if it’s better if I touch base async to assist or give input).</p>

<p>Success in any week is pushing my three to five top priorities forward and being as useful as possible to others in a dozen or more areas. Often it’s connecting where many needs overlap (the customers, the business, leadership requests, etc.), and learning how to gracefully defer or say no when needs can’t be met. Ultimately, AI is just a path to build something great that people want—it constrains the method and solutions, but choosing the most important customer segments and their key problems is at the heart of PM work.</p></dd>


<dt class="pagebreak-before less_space">What do you want people coming into the field to know?</dt>

<dd><p>It’s hard—I feel like AI PM is the neurosurgery of PM work. You have to learn a ton of specialized knowledge and keep up with a firehose of papers and research, while working with highly technical teams to implement ideas, where small mistakes can have big consequences.</p></dd>

<dt>What was your path to AI product <br/>management?</dt>

<dd><p>I started out as a software engineer, but early in my career I realized that I had more passion for using technology to help solve user needs than for pushing technology for the sake of technology. While working as an engineer during the day, I went to NYU Stern [School of Business]<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="NYU Stern School of Business" data-type="indexterm" id="id981"/> at night and received my MBA. That credential proved to be an accelerant on my path to product management.</p></dd>


<dt>Describe a day in your life as an AI product leader.</dt>

<dd><p>As a product leader, the biggest focus should be on understanding customer needs, prioritization, and resource allocation. Once you reach a certain level of seniority in your career, your primary job is not always about figuring out the best solution. What is most important is understanding what the opportunities are, making sure you have the right team to capitalize on those opportunities, and then setting those people up for success.</p></dd>


<dt>What do you want people coming into the field to know?</dt>

<dd><p>AI is an amazing tool, but it is not a product in itself. With the increase in software possibilities with AI, the fundamentals of true product management become even more important. That’s focusing on customer needs and making sure that you are bringing the right solutions to market. Users don’t care about what technology is used. They care about which product meets their needs.</p></dd>

<p>Yana Welinder is the CEO and founder of Kraftful.</p>

<dl>
<dt>What was your path to AI product <br/>management?</dt>

<dd><p>I <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI PMs (AI product managers)" data-secondary="profiles of" data-tertiary="Welinder, Yana" data-type="indexterm" id="kab001"/>transitioned into product management after a diverse career in law, tech policy, and academia. As a professor, I authored the most cited paper on the policy implications of AI and computer vision, published in the Harvard Journal of Law and Technology. My research at Stanford and Harvard opened doors to speak at the White House, the UN Internet Governance Forum, and other intellectually stimulating events. Yet, I always felt something was missing in my work. Returning to industry as a Director at the Wikimedia Foundation, I had two significant opportunities to dive into product management: (1) leading the product, research, and design team to develop strategy recommendations for improving the Wikipedia readership experience; and (2) spearheading the transition of Wikipedia to encrypted access (HTTPS by default).</p>

<p>These experiences revealed what had been missing: the tangible, user-focused impact of building products. Next, I became PM number two at Carbon, a fast-growing unicorn disrupting manufacturing and enabling previously impossible designs—most notably the Adidas shoe with a lattice structure. This role was a crash course in product management, spanning software, hardware, and materials science, all supported by an in-house R&amp;D lab. I worked on various AI-enabled products before founding Kraftful, where I now build AI products for product managers, combining my passions for product craft, AI, and innovation.</p></dd>


<dt>Describe a day in your life as a CEO of an AI startup.</dt>

<dd><p>Startups always operate in dog years, and AI capabilities are growing exponentially. Running an AI startup right now feels like sprinting at the speed of light—yet somehow never fast enough. I reflected on this yesterday while rebuilding our AI analysis with the latest large language models. This involves experimenting with new prompts and parameters of the latest large language models, work I usually tackle on weekends when I’m not in meetings. During the week, I share my findings with our engineers, who then build the architecture to scale the prompt chain I’ve developed. This sparks frequent impromptu meetings to review results and fine-tune our approach. </p>

<p>At the same time, other engineers are focused on new features and UI improvements, where my role shifts to traditional product management—defining features and collaborating with design and engineering to bring them to life. A large part of my day is also spent talking with customers via calls or Intercom, gaining insights into how we can make Kraftful better. This is especially critical when building an AI product that has never existed before—our customers refine their requirements as they use it, helping us adapt and improve in real time.</p></dd>


<dt>What do you want someone who’s coming into the field to know—one piece of advice if they’re considering becoming an AI PM?</dt>

<dd><p>AI is a rapidly evolving field, and entering it can feel like merging onto a fast-moving freeway. The key is to stay up-to-date with the latest trends, models, and tools while mastering the fundamentals. Familiarize yourself with core concepts like machine learning, natural language processing, and neural networks. You don’t need to be an AI engineer, but you should be comfortable discussing these technologies with your team. Your role is to translate complex AI capabilities into solutions that users find valuable and easy to adopt. Most importantly, focus on building a product that solves a real problem. Always start with the problem in mind—this will keep you from creating an AI solution in search of a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI PMs (AI product managers)" data-secondary="profiles of" data-startref="kab001" data-tertiary="Welinder, Yana" data-type="indexterm" id="id982"/>problem.</p></dd>
