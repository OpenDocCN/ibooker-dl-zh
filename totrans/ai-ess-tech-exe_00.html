 <h1>Why We Wrote This Book</h1>
 
  <p>There’s a significant disconnect between the people building AI products and the executives making decisions about them, leading to misguided strategies and wasted resources. For nonpractitioners, navigating the AI space is overwhelming. There’s a sea of advice on how to create effective AI products, but much of it comes from sources that aren’t hands-on with the technology.</p>
 
<p>Without practical experience, it’s challenging to separate fact from fiction and make informed decisions. On the flip side, AI practitioners in the trenches often struggle to communicate their knowledge in a way that resonates with executives. They tend to think and speak in technical terms, which can be off-putting or confusing for those without a deep technical background. This is where we come in.</p>

<p>I’m <a href="https://hamel.dev">Hamel Husain</a>, an AI practitioner deeply involved in the technical aspects of artificial intelligence. My partner is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregceccarelli">Greg Ceccarelli</a>, who brings extensive executive leadership experience as a Director and Chief Product Officer at large organizations like <a href="https://pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> and <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>With the combination of my hands-on AI experience and Greg’s executive leadership background, you can be sure that everything you read from us is both technically accurate and accessible to executives like you. In this report, you’ll receive practical and actionable insights on unlocking the true potential of AI to create competitive advantage.</p>
