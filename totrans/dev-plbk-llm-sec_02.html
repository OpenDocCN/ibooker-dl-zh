      <h1><span class="label">Chapter 2. </span>The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications</h1>&#13;
      <p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project)" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html0"/>In the spring of 2023, I began researching security vulnerabilities specific to LLMs. At the time, there was a relatively large body of research on security for AI in general, but very little organized research about LLMs. However, I did find some research papers and blogs that covered some ideas in the area. I began the process of collecting these research papers and summarizing them using ChatGPT. Eventually, I provided a few examples from the current Top 10 list of web application vulnerabilities and asked ChatGPT to generate a draft Top 10 for LLMs in a similar format.</p>&#13;
      <p>I thought what came out looked interesting, so I sent it to Jeff Williams, a founder of OWASP, the Open Worldwide Application Security Project, to see what he thought. Jeff, Contrast Security’s chief technology officer, wrote the first OWASP Top 10 list in 2001. His goal was to create an accessible resource for developers that detailed the most critical risks and vulnerable areas of web applications. At the time, the World Wide Web was still only a few years old, and most developers had little to no understanding of how to create secure web applications. That original Top 10 list became a seminal work and a foundational resource in application security.</p>&#13;
      <p>I didn’t tell Jeff that my list was primarily machine generated. As the original Top 10 list’s author, I figured he could give me an idea of whether my Top 10 list looked novel and worth pursuing. Jeff encouraged me to petition the OWASP board for approval to spin it up as a new project. A few weeks later, the OWASP board approved the project, and I announced it, along with a link to a refined version of the draft Top 10 I’d generated with ChatGPT. </p>&#13;
      <p>What I thought would be an obscure research project and a bit of fun turned out to be much bigger. When I announced the project formation on my personal LinkedIn page, I’d hoped to find a dozen or so like-minded individuals interested in the obscure topic of LLM security. As it turned out, my initial blog post racked up almost 10,000 views, and hundreds of individuals volunteered to join the expert team in the weeks that followed.</p>&#13;
      <p>This book isn’t a product of OWASP, and the vulnerabilities and risks here won’t precisely map to any public version of the Top 10 for LLM apps list. Instead, you should expect to see my view on these risks. However, my learning and thinking on the topic is heavily influenced by my work leading the project and the creation and initial release of the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications list. Since then, I’ve had many people ask me for details about how we ran the project and how we were able to create such an impactful framework in such a short time. So, before we examine individual risks and vulnerabilities, I’ll give you some of the backstory of OWASP and the LLM Applications project.</p>&#13;
      <section data-pdf-bookmark="About OWASP" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="about_owasp">&#13;
        <h1>About OWASP</h1>&#13;
        <p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project)" data-secondary="basics" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html1"/>The Open Worldwide Application Security Project is a nonprofit organization focused on improving software security. Founded in 2001, OWASP provides a platform for security experts to share their knowledge and best practices about web security, from application-level vulnerabilities to emerging threats. Today, it has tens of thousands of active members and over 250 local chapters around the globe.</p>&#13;
        <p>The organization is community-driven and encourages the participation of volunteers who contribute to various projects, including documentation, tools, and forums. It operates under an open source model, making its resources freely accessible to the public. Over the years, OWASP has garnered a strong following among the security community, and its guidelines and tools are considered industry standards in many contexts.</p>&#13;
        <p>In addition to the original Top 10 list for web applications (updated regularly, most recently in 2021), specialized Top 10 lists have emerged from OWASP over the years. These include:</p>&#13;

        <h1>The Top 10 for LLM Applications Project</h1>&#13;
        <p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project)" data-secondary="OWASP top 10 for LLM applications" data-type="indexterm" id="id269"/>Within a week after I posted the announcement about the formation of the Top 10 for LLM Applications project, well over 200 people had signed on to it, and we held a kick-off event via Zoom. At that first meeting, I laid out a vision for what I hoped the group could accomplish and proposed an aggressive roadmap: we would build the first version of the list in eight weeks. A typical OWASP Top 10 list may take a year or more to develop, but we decided that this space was moving so fast and this type of resource was so needed that we had to work more quickly.</p>&#13;
        <p>We decided to run the project in two-week, Agile-style sprints. Since most of the experts in the group were familiar with Agile development, everyone quickly adapted to the pace. </p>&#13;
        <section data-pdf-bookmark="Project Execution" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="project_execution">&#13;
          <h2>Project Execution</h2>&#13;
          <p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project)" data-secondary="OWASP top 10 for LLM applications" data-tertiary="execution" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html3"/>The first sprint of the project was brainstorming and commentary. Everyone reviewed the original version of the list, which I called version 0.1. There were plenty of problems with that initial version, and the team was aggressive about pointing them out. At the same time, we began to create a wiki page with links to all the resources the group found on LLM security issues. It turned out a lot had been written, but this was the first time anyone had ever collected the information and made it easy to access. This new, curated collection of resources was the first win for the group.</p>&#13;
          <p>The second sprint was to generate a new version of the list. This time, rather than being the work of a single person and an AI, it would be the product of the collective wisdom of our expert team, which continued to grow week by week. In the first week, the group focused on generating ideas for the Top 10 list. We published a template and asked the group to submit candidate vulnerabilities. In that week, we developed 43 detailed descriptions of possible areas. We then conducted two rounds of voting using Google Forms, leveraging the team’s collective wisdom to narrow the list to 10, which we published as version 0.5. This version was far more detailed and <span class="keep-together">comprehensive</span> than version 0.1. The positive reception from the larger community gave the group the energy to keep working.</p>&#13;
          <p>The next sprint was used to refine each entry. We created Slack channels for each vulnerability type and chose a volunteer as the entry lead for each item. Subteams of 10 to 30 individuals then fleshed out and tuned each entry. Again, we included a round of voting for the whole team to be involved and point out weak areas that needed more attention. Along the way, we found some entries overlapped and merged them. This change created space to pull up some entries that had fallen below the 10 item cut-off. The result of this sprint became version 0.9 of the list. Interestingly, the word count of version 0.9 was about 33% shorter than 0.5; the extra time and refinement had allowed the subteams to focus their thinking and make the entries punchy and tight.</p>&#13;
          <p>Finally, we took a final sprint to review, tweak, and clean up each entry. We gathered another round of feedback via Google Forms to ensure everything was ready. By this time we had a dedicated design lead who laid out the whole document in an attractive PDF for publication.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html3" data-type="indexterm" id="id270"/></p>&#13;
        </div></section>&#13;
        <section data-pdf-bookmark="Reception" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="reception_idxZ5XUS">&#13;
          <h2>Reception</h2>&#13;
          <p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project)" data-secondary="OWASP top 10 for LLM applications" data-tertiary="reception" data-type="indexterm" id="ch02.html4"/>My announcement for the 1.0 version of the list was viewed on LinkedIn over 40,000 times. And that doesn’t include the many posts made by group members on their own pages and blogs. In the days following the publication of the announcement, reporters picked up the news and it was covered in media outlets such as <em>Wired</em>, <em>SD Times</em>, <em>The Register</em>, <em>I</em><em>nfosecurity</em><em> Magazine</em>, and <em>Diginomica</em>. It’s safe to say hundreds of thousands of people became aware of our work in just the first few weeks.</p>&#13;
          <p>Beyond the sheer number of people exposed, the thing that amazed me was the uniformly positive feedback. We also saw the first government agencies in the US and Europe referencing our work as a foundational document. While everyone on our expert team agreed there was much more to do, it seemed the world was so hungry for advice in this area that our document hit the mark. While we received many questions and comments, it’s safe to say that everyone involved felt pleased and proud of our work. </p>&#13;

        <section data-pdf-bookmark="Keys to Success" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="keys_to_success">&#13;
          <h2>Keys to Success</h2>&#13;
          <p>Many people have asked me how we could drive this project so quickly to a successful outcome. Looking back, I believe several factors contributed. I’ll share them here in the hopes that others running similar projects in the future might benefit.</p>&#13;
          <p>Timing undoubtedly played a considerable role. The wave of interest in LLMs that followed the release of ChatGPT was massive. It drew my attention, and countless others became excited as well. This helped attract a large and diverse expert group and motivated a smaller group of these people to spend long hours on the project with a tight deadline.</p>&#13;
          <p>Having a clear plan and timeline from the start was crucial. My knowledge of LLM security was limited at the beginning of the project, but I’ve made a career of running complex projects with many contributors. Creating a clear roadmap with specific phases and a schedule let people know what we were doing and when. The fact that everyone could see a goal that wasn’t too far away kept people motivated. Every two weeks, we had global meetings via Zoom and posted recordings on YouTube for people who couldn’t attend live. The meetings and recordings were critical to coordinating a globally distributed team.</p>&#13;
          <p>A freeform but short brainstorming phase at the start was critical. LLM security was such a new area that taking those first two weeks for people to throw out ideas and argue on Slack was crucial. It also allowed us to collect and socialize a repository of the existing research in the area. That let us start at a point where everyone on the project had access to the best preexisting research. </p>&#13;
          <p>However, keeping this phase short was equally critical. We could maintain momentum by limiting brainstorming to two weeks and shifting quickly to a creation phase. I’ve seen other projects get stuck and be unable to move past brainstorming before people lose interest.</p>&#13;
          <p>Creating the project’s core team wasn’t something I’d originally planned, but it became critical. Having a large expert team was a fantastic asset. The group grew to nearly 500 people by the time we published 1.0. A team that large would have been totally unmanageable. During the project’s first few weeks, I was looking for active and knowledgeable people. I approached about a dozen of them and asked if they’d be willing to join the project’s core leadership team. I told them it would be extra work, but they’d get to be at the heart of the project. There would be no specific reward for taking this role. Most accepted immediately. I believe that recognizing people and asking for their support formally motivated them to spend more time and energy on the project. They were all invested! </p>&#13;
          <p>Short sprints with visible deliverables are a core tenet of Agile, and this is a place where it shined. Using an Agile Release Train model, I could continue to drive the group forward despite conflicting opinions. If some members had concerns about an area, we didn’t let it get us stuck. We acknowledged it and agreed we’d resolve it in the next sprint. When we got to version 1.0 of the list, there were still some places where people wanted to do more, so we just agreed there would be more versions of the list. It would be a living document, and the most important thing was to get a version of this resource into the hands of the developers who needed it<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch02.html4" data-type="indexterm" id="id271"/>.</p>&#13;

        <p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project)" data-secondary="author’s top 10 for LLM applications" data-type="indexterm" id="id272"/>As I mentioned, this book is not a product of the OWASP Foundation. However, the experience of working with this team has had an enormous impact on my understanding of and perspectives on LLM security. This mindset means that much of the guidance in the following chapters is influenced by the fantastic team that builds and maintains the Top 10 project. In this way, readers should feel comfortable that they’re getting advice that isn’t the product of a single author, but is informed by a larger community of experts.</p>&#13;
        <p>In the following several chapters, we’ll review the top risk and vulnerability areas for LLMs. The risks we discuss will contain many areas common to the OWASP Top 10, but won’t be precisely the same as any version of the official Top 10 list. The Top 10 list is a quick read that highlights critical areas; here, we’ll dig more deeply into the risks, remediation steps, and expanded real-world case studies.</p>&#13;
        <p>We’ll return to the OWASP version of the Top 10 list in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#learning_from_future_history">Chapter 10</a>, where we’ll briefly review the 2023 version of the list and map it to chapters in this book. We’ll then show how to use the Top 10 framework to document and share analysis of security vulnerabilities and successful exploits.</p>&#13;
        <p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#architectures_and_trust_boundaries">Chapter 3</a>, we’ll examine the overall structure of typical LLM applications and discuss the trust boundaries and dangers. Subsequent chapters will then probe individual risk areas and examine vulnerabilities, attacks, and examples so that you can plan your strategy for securing your own use cases. </p>&#13;
