<p class="body">WordPress <i class="fm-italics">themes</i> are all about design—how your site looks to your visitors. Some themes also add plugins for functionality, but the main focus in most cases is on appearance.<a id="idIndexMarker001"/></p>
<p class="body">There are tens of thousands of themes. But don’t worry about finding the perfect theme—in an upcoming chapter, I’ll show you how to easily modify and fine-tune <i class="fm-italics">any</i> theme. So, for now, just find a theme whose design is somewhat similar to what you’re after. Exactly which design elements or functionality a theme brings to your site varies from theme to theme, but here are some typical elements:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Layout</i>—The location of sidebars, menus, header images, columnar text, and other elements. Often the theme will allow you to choose from several options when positioning, for example, a sidebar.<a id="idIndexMarker002"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Behaviors</i>—How links, buttons, the blog page, and other features look and behave.<a id="idIndexMarker003"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Color schemes</i>—Colors that a designer considers harmonic and appropriate to the site’s purpose. Themes are often designed for a particular site topic, such as an artist’s portfolio or a lawyer’s practice. In almost all cases, the theme allows you to easily change the colors and typography in the Appearance &gt; Customize screen.<a id="idIndexMarker004"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Typography</i>—How the text characters in headlines, body text, captions, and other text elements look.<a id="idIndexMarker005"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Backgrounds</i>—Frames around pages and background images.<a id="idIndexMarker006"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Plugins</i>—Default functionality that is provided by the theme, such as an e-commerce system or security defense.<a id="idIndexMarker007"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Widgets</i>—Functionality that goes on a sidebar or footer, such as the hours your store is open or an events calendar.<a id="idIndexMarker008"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Forms</i>—Filled in by visitors so you can contact them via email or request information such as their credit card.<a id="idIndexMarker009"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Image displays</i>—Sliders or carousels that animate your images.<a id="idIndexMarker010"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Social media features</i>—Functionality that automates sending your blog’s posts to your social media, or a button that, when clicked, posts a blog message to a visitor’s social media. <a id="idIndexMarker011"/><a id="marker-142"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">Every WordPress site has a theme. When you first create a new site, WordPress installs a default theme of its own design. The name of this default theme is the current year: Twenty Twenty-Five, Twenty Twenty-Six, and so on. (All the official WordPress themes from past years remain updated and available.) But changing to a different theme is quite easy, at least in the early stages of site building.</p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">
<p class="fm-sidebar-title">Choose the right theme early in the site-building process</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">When you’re just starting a new site, switching to different themes is pretty painless. But if a site is mature, or large, replacing a theme can be complicated.<a id="idIndexMarker012"/></p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Consider these potential hazards:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet1">
<p class="list-s">Does your theme bring extra functionality to your site (in addition to styling), such as shortcodes, custom widgets, or post formats? These will be lost if you change themes.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet1">
<p class="list-s">Changing a theme can also damage some of your site’s core features such as your contact forms, menu bar, and theme-specific widgets or plugins.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet1">
<p class="list-s">Links can break—pointing to addresses on the site that no longer exist. The “How to Find and Fix Broken Links in WordPress (Step by Step)” article on the WPBeginner website (<a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/wJYa">https://mng.bz/wJYa</a>) describes the Broken Link Checker tool as well as other available tools that help you ensure your site’s links are good. And, “How to Automatically Find and Fix Broken Links in WordPress” on the Themeisle site (<a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/qxJ6">https://mng.bz/qxJ6</a>) explains the process of fixing links.<a id="idIndexMarker013"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Finally, here’s some more good advice from WPBeginner about changing the theme if you have a large,<a id="idTextAnchor003"/> mature site: <a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/7pJ7">https://mng.bz/7pJ7</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Warning</span> To avoid having to change themes, you might want to stay away from free themes. They are more likely to be abandoned by their designer. Instead, use a <i class="fm-italics">freemium </i>theme—one that has both a free and a paid version. When a theme provides income, its developer is less likely to quit updating it, thus forcing you to change to a different theme. That said, the free themes provided by WordPress itself aren’t abandoned. And some of them are quite good—particularly Twenty Sixteen.<a id="idIndexMarker014"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_3">6.1 Choosing an appropriate theme</h2>
<p class="body">Your site has a purpose, preferably a narrowly focused, single goal. And the look and feel of your design should support that goal. It’s true that the majority of your visitors won’t likely consciously deconstruct the design elements, but that’s no reason for <i class="fm-italics">you</i> to ignore them.<a id="idIndexMarker015"/><a id="marker-143"/></p>
<p class="body">People know how they feel, if not always why they feel that way. You want to create a space that’s appropriate to the site’s purpose and avoids annoying your audience. Make them feel comfortable.</p>
<p class="body">Some themes are clearly wrong: decorating a marriage counselor’s site with happy clowns dancing around with balloons—nope. Including pictures of farm machinery in a party rental site isn’t a good idea either, nor is blood-red crimson as the main color in a hospital site.</p>
<p class="body">And some themes offer a variety of templates—variations on the theme. (Templates are sometimes called <i class="fm-italics">child themes</i>).<a id="idIndexMarker016"/></p>
<p class="body">As you know from your school days, popularity isn’t a guarantee of future success, but it provides a hint. As with plugins, you want to look for a popular theme—in most cases, this predicts both quality and longevity. And if you prefer not to invest much up front, you can start with a freemium theme—use its free plan at first and perhaps later move up to the premium plan. Here’s a list of several quality popular themes (<a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/mGzW">https://mng.bz/mGzW</a>; all except Divi are freemium):</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Astra</i>—This theme offers quite a few prebuilt or template elements to choose from, including menus, layouts, color options, and more. It’s also compatible with WooCommerce and various page-builder plugins, and includes search engine optimization (SEO) tools.<a id="idIndexMarker017"/><a id="idIndexMarker018"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">OceanWP—</i>The theme has a collection of prebuilt complete sites appropriate for many purposes. It’s also compatible with WooCommerce and SEO. <a id="idIndexMarker019"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Divi—</i>By Elegant Themes, Divi has its own drag-and-drop page builder plus many ready-made layouts for a variety of site goals. It has additional compatibility with SEO and WooCommerce. It’s not freemium, but it is free to try for 30 days. <a id="idIndexMarker020"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">SeedProd—</i>More than just a Coming Soon page utility, SeedProd has a respected drag-and-drop page builder and a collection of quality templates. <a id="idIndexMarker021"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Ultra—</i>This theme includes a sizable set of sample sites that you can use as a base to build on. It also has a proprietar<a id="idTextAnchor004"/>y page builder called Themify.<a id="idIndexMarker022"/><a id="marker-144"/></p>

<div class="fm-sidebar-block">
<p class="fm-sidebar-title">Don’t forget responsiveness</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">When choosing your theme, ensure that it’s <i class="fm-italics">responsive.</i> Responsiveness means that the page layout, menu, and other elements of your site will be effectively redrawn and rearranged so a visitor to your site can easily read, click, and otherwise interact on <i class="fm-italics">any</i> size screen. Your site is going to be viewed on screens ranging in size from flat-screen TVs down to cellphones. Clearly, it’s a necessary, albeit challenging, task to accommodate all of these dimensions and screen shapes.<a id="idIndexMarker023"/></p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Most site builders construct their sites on a desktop monitor, but most visitors to a site will be using a cellphone (it’s estimated that 60% of all internet traffic is via cellphone). Clearly, links that are easily clicked by a mouse on a 27-inch monitor can be quite hard to hit with a finger on a cellphone screen—unless there’s plenty of space between the links.</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Responsiveness requires a variety of adjustments. For example, what appears as a horizontal list of menu items on a large screen will be displayed vertically on a cellphone. Sometimes the word “Menu” is all you see. The visitor taps that word to open a vertical list of the menu items.</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">A quality theme will ensure responsiveness—text is easy to read, links can be easily triggered, and page design isn’t askew—even when reduced down to a 2-inch-wide cellphone screen. That said, before you make your site public, test it on several screen sizes and shapes—phone, tablet, laptop, and monitor—to see if you need to do some tweaking. And note that Google judges the quality of sites by their mobile friendliness, among many other things.</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">You can go to any page in your site and press Ctrl-Shift-I to open the Inspector. Up top, you’ll see Dimensions. Drop that menu down to view your site on different screen sizes and shapes.<a id="idIndexMarker024"/></p>
</div>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_4">6.2 Use an up-to-date theme</h2>
<p class="body">You should install a theme that’s being kept up-to-date by its developers. This is another reason to choose a paid or freemium theme because the owners of those themes are making money and are unlikely to abandon this income stream. This isn’t an absolute guarantee of longevity (some theme developers have dropped a theme in favor of a different one, and some have gone out of business), but we’re talking about the odds.<a id="idIndexMarker025"/><a id="idIndexMarker026"/><a id="marker-145"/></p>
<p class="body">If a theme is listed in the WordPress library, hover your mouse on the theme’s thumbnail image, and click More Info. This will tell you how popular the theme is and if it’s being kept up-to-date. Here are five reasons to avoid outdated themes:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Security</i>—Themes that aren’t updated can become a target for hackers because updates quite often include patches for security vulnerabilities. Remember that themes, like plugins, are computer code and can thus potentially provide an entrance for malware.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Compatibility</i>—WordPress itself is updated regularly. If your theme isn’t keeping up with these updates, you can start experiencing compatibility problems that affect functionality in your site.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">User experience (UX)</i>—Site design and features evolve. A theme that isn’t actively improved can look and behave outdated. It might become slow or even fail to be effectively responsive, causing it to look bad on screens of various shapes and sizes.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">No support</i>—If a theme is abandoned, so too is any support. So, if you’re having a problem with the theme, you can get no solutions from its developer.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">No new features</i>—In addition to plugging security holes, theme updates can include new features or improvements to existing ones. This, too, can limit the functionality and appeal of your website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Definition</span> Cascading style sheets (CSS) is a design language that allows you to pretty much totally revise any of a theme’s design choices. We’ll dive deeply into CSS in chapter 7. You’ll find out that you need not actually learn the CSS language. You can just describe what you want changed, and AI will write the code for you. Or you can use a what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) plugin that also generates CSS for you automatically. (Recall that these days, human programmers are fast becoming unneeded.) <a id="idIndexMarker027"/><a id="idIndexMarker028"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_5">6.3 Avoid installing multiple themes</h2>
<p class="body">You can have more than one theme active in a WordPress site by using a plugin for that purpose. So, if you want a different look for, say, your blog page or several pages displaying your catalog, you might try a multi-theme installation. But honestly, having multiple themes is probably more trouble than it’s worth. Plugins supporting multiple themes come and go rather quickly, so if you install one, you’ll likely end up having to find a replacement plugin at some point. Such plugins can also slow down your site or create side effects and incompatibilities. <a id="idIndexMarker029"/><a id="idIndexMarker030"/></p>
<p class="body">So, you would be better off considering activating a single theme such as SeedProd that offers many page templates. It has a drag-and-drop page builder that gives you freedom to design pages individually. And SeedProd supplies more than 150 predesigned templates that can be applied individually to different pages. In effect, it’s like a multi-theme collection. Astra and Divi are also good multi-template themes to consider.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> Go to your Appearance &gt; Themes screen after you’ve activated your chosen theme. If there are any other installed themes, uninstall them. Inactive themes take up server space, can be an entrance for malware (after all, they are code on the host’s server), and can slow down your site.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_6">6.4 Don’t modify theme code files</h2>
<p class="body">“Look, but don’t touch” is the best advice when visiting your Appearance &gt; Theme File Editor screen. WordPress itself displays this message: There is no need to change your CSS here— you can edit and live preview CSS changes in the built-in CSS editor. And then, WordPress provides a link to your site’s Appearance &gt; Customize &gt; Additional CSS screen. That CSS screen, as you’ll learn shortly, is the location where you should modify CSS, not in the theme’s style.css file. <a id="idIndexMarker031"/><a id="idIndexMarker032"/><a id="marker-146"/><a id="idIndexMarker033"/></p>
<p class="body">Making mistakes when modifying the theme’s CSS code will rarely trigger a disaster. After all, CSS is about design—it just describes a site’s colors, layout, and other appearance elements. And things like that don’t break a site.</p>
<p class="body">But one good thing about putting CSS code in the Additional CSS screen is that when your theme gets updated, this screen remains untouched. So your CSS survives. By contrast, any changes you make in the Theme File Editor will be overwritten by a theme update.</p>
<p class="body">The theme’s CSS file isn’t the only code file you can access in the Theme File Editor screen. Figure 6.1 displays some of the theme’s PHP and JavaScript programming code files. (What you see here depends on your theme.)</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="761" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH06_F01_Mansfield.png" width="534"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 6.1 You can view your theme’s code files if you wish, but don’t modify anything.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">The programming code files govern site <i class="fm-italics">behaviors</i> instead of appearance. For example, there’s code describing how the blog page should list its posts. Other code manages the site’s built-in search tool. Mess with these, and you’d better know how to program in PHP or JavaScript. And remember, changes you make here will be wiped out during the next theme update.</p>
<p class="body">Some security plugins, hosting services, IT staff, and theme developers—tired of having to provide tech support when people mangle these theme code files—simply remove the Theme File Editor from the WordPress menu. There’s also a Plugins &gt; Plugin File Editor to which the same “Don’t touch” warnings apply. So unless you really understand the code languages, avoid modifying either the theme or plugin files.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_7">6.5 Take advantage of the Appearance &gt; Customize screen</h2>
<p class="body">Themes give you some easy ways to modify the site’s design elements. They are found in the Appearance &gt; Customize screen. Theme developers decide how many and which modifications you can make here, so among different themes, there’s quite a range of how many options you’re given.<a id="idIndexMarker034"/><a id="marker-147"/><a id="idIndexMarker035"/></p>
<p class="body">Free themes tend to limit you to only a handful of customizations. But popular premium themes usually offer considerably more, both in the Customize screen and elsewhere. Some paid themes even include full-featured page-builder systems—similar to WordPress’s Gutenberg block editor, only usually better.</p>
<p class="body">Most of the modifications you can make in the Appearance &gt; Customize screen are WYSIWYG. You can see the effect of your changes instantly. And remember, given that you’re not modifying the theme’s files (in the Theme File Editor screen), changes you make in the Appearance &gt; Customize screen will survive a theme update.</p>
<p class="body">Here’s a list of the customizations offered by WordPress’s own Twenty Sixteen theme. This set is typical of what free themes provide:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Typography</i>—Font family, weight, underline, strikethrough, overline, case, color, background color, size, letter spacing, margins, padding, border, and border radius. These customizations can be made to the body text and six levels of headlines.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Site identity</i>—Title, tagline, logo, and icon (it’s a small symbol that’s displayed in browser tabs and bookmarks).</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Colors</i>—Complete color schemes (titled dark, system, light, red, yellow, default), page background color (what’s underneath the text and media content of all the pages on the site), page frame color (a border around the pages), main text (body text and headlines), secondary text (footers, tagline, dates on posts), and hyperlinks.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Header image</i>—An image that appears on each page of the site, usually below the site title, but above the body content.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Background image</i>—An image that appears as a border around the page, replacing the page frame color.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Menus</i>—The location of the menu(s). Rather than working in the Customize screen, it’s more efficient to go to your Appearance &gt; Menus screen to manage the menu location(s).</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Widgets</i>—Small units of functionality (calendar, map to a store), similar to plugins, which appear on the sidebar in your site. Rather than working in the Customize screen, it’s easier to work with widgets in your Appearance &gt; Widgets screen instead.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Homepage settings</i>—Whether your site displays the blog on the home page, or a static page instead. It’s more efficient to manage this in your Settings &gt; Reading screen.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Additional CSS</i>—A screen where you can customize the appearance of your site, add custom animation, and other design modifications. We’ll explore CSS in depth in chapter 7.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_8">6.6 Consider the psychology of color</h2>
<p class="body">As with many other design elements, people are affected by your site’s color scheme, even if they aren’t aware of it. Colors evoke subconscious feelings, sending a message in support of—or in opposition to—the site’s purpose. Colors can generate a mood in your visitors and can even affect their behavior within the site or speed up their exit.<a id="idIndexMarker036"/><a id="idIndexMarker037"/><a id="marker-148"/></p>
<p class="body">Fortunately, there are guidelines to help you choose colors for your page background, page frame, typography, and other elements. For example, medical sites almost universally choose variations of white (conveying cleanliness) paired with light blue (reliability, trustworthiness, and authority). Rarer is a green and white pairing, although green <i class="fm-italics">is</i> associated with health. Red is extremely rare for the same reason that you won’t find bullfight paintings in the waiting room, unless the doctor and his entire staff are insensate.</p>
<p class="body">Halloween sites go for black and orange. Bridal shops choose white, of course, and delicate pastels. Christmas shops are in red, white, and green. Banks use blue, and less often red (associated with action) and yellow (warmth). Some legal and banking sites eliminate color altogether, choosing monochromatic schemes—black, white, and gray (suggesting sobriety—that there’s no fooling around here—color being frivolous).</p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">

<p class="body">You can, of course, choose a theme that reflects your site’s topic, and then trust the designer’s choice for an appropriate default color scheme, or choice of schemes, in the Appearance &gt; Customize screen.

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_9">6.7 Pay attention to layout</h2>
<p class="body"><i class="fm-italics">Layout</i>—how the various content zones of your pages interact—must also be considered when designing a site. These zones are made up of blocks of text; media, such as images or video; and the empty areas known as white space. But zones can also be sidebars, menus, or other distinct sections of content. The main idea is that you want your pages to look balanced. <a id="idIndexMarker040"/><a id="idIndexMarker041"/><a id="marker-149"/></p>
<p class="body">When people hear the word <i class="fm-italics">balance</i>, they automatically think of symmetry—an equilibrium like a balance scale or a pendulum. But with visuals, such as paintings or web pages, balance isn’t that simple. Many factors are at play. And usually, strict symmetry is the worst choice!</p>
<p class="body">Say you’re taking a picture of a glorious mountain view: a <i class="fm-italics">balanced</i> photograph would involve just the right amount of scenery in the foreground, like a moose or a house. In the background, perhaps you’d have snowcapped mountains. And, finally, you’d have a bright blue sky above. It’s the contrast between these parts that provides dimensionality and appeal. But you need to ensure that the foreground, background, and sky are in balance. Not too much sky, or too little, for example—and not three equal zones either.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Note</span> Consider the egg. Some say that it’s the perfect form because it’s an asymmetric sphere.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_10">6.7.1 Achieving balance without symmetry</h3>
<p class="body">Visual balance can involve multiple interacting elements: everything from empty space between content, lines that lead the eye, color, contrast, headline size, and more. And there are some seeming paradoxes. For example, a large empty area can have the same visual weight as a smaller, but detailed, content area. In other words, white space itself has weight. Luckily, there are some rules you can employ to create pleasing, balanced pages. And even more luckily, you now have a design expert to provide suggestions—your AI assistant.<a id="marker-150"/><a id="idIndexMarker042"/><a id="idIndexMarker043"/></p>
<p class="body">One tactic is to just let a pro (or a friend talented at visual design) give you predesigned layouts to choose from. Then, you just use their layout template, replacing their images and text with yours. Designers create layouts that, in most cases, are already well balanced. You would just use the same positioning and size of the blocks of text and images or other media that the designer used. One drawback though is that this can lead to too much similarity among the pages on your site, or even similarity between your site and others that use this same template.</p>
<p class="body">Layout involves adjusting the position, size, and alignment of a page’s content. Your goal is to end up with a visually attractive design that’s appropriate to the message you want the page to convey. And it should also guide a visitor’s eye along a path that you prefer them to take.</p>
<p class="body">First, you’ll want to create a starting point, a <i class="fm-italics">focal point</i>, the location within the page that is in some way more intense—it’s whatever first attracts viewers’ attention. It’s where they will start their path through the page. Perhaps it’s the most detailed, or largest, or brightest, or in some cases, the most shocking, area in the page. As you’ll soon see, there’s a rule that can tell you where to put the focal point, and there are actually <i class="fm-italics">four specific locations</i> within a page from which you can choose. It’s called the <i class="fm-italics">rule of thirds.</i> You’ll learn much more about this rule shortly.<a id="idIndexMarker044"/><a id="idIndexMarker045"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> In website lingo, the focal point is often called the <i class="fm-italics">hero</i>. Especially on the home page, you want the focal point to define or represent the site in some way. The hero is most often an image or other visual. If text, it should be a brief headline. The hero’s qualities—color, fonts, shapes, and so on—should usually also be reflected in the design on the rest of the page. This provides visual cohesion.</p>
<p class="body">Your pages should be balanced—visually weighted so the zones of content are pleasingly distributed. The easiest shortcut to achieve theoretically ideal balance is to just make the page symmetrical. Exact symmetry, however, can result in a page that looks static, old-fashioned, or even dead. Many attractive, modern sites avoid strict symmetry, though there are always exceptions. Balance without rigid symmetry is why, when asked what’s the perfect shape, some will say the egg rather than the sphere.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_11">6.7.2 Considering Mondrian’s classic balancing act</h3>
<p class="body">Piet Mondrian’s paintings are famous for achieving balance without rigid symmetry. Notice in figure 6.2 that some areas are <i class="fm-italics">nearly</i> symmetrical in size. But, the entire composition is balanced both horizontally and vertically. (This image isn’t an original Mondrian; it was generated by Midjourney AI in the style of Mondrian. And color has been removed to focus on the shapes and their interplay.) There is <i class="fm-italics">some</i> symmetry in figure 6.2—can you spot it? (Answer is coming up shortly.)<a id="idIndexMarker046"/><a id="idIndexMarker047"/><a id="idIndexMarker048"/><a id="marker-151"/></p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 6.2 Your task when designing page layouts is to effectively balance the various blocks of content without resorting to symmetry.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">One way to critique your layout is to divide the page into four zones, and then see if all four have closely equivalent visual weight. Figure 6.3 illustrates this.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="423" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH06_F03_Mansfield.png" width="709"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 6.3 When an image is separated into a quadrant, you can more easily check the balance.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">Some will say, clearly the upper-right zone is less heavy than the others. But weight isn’t only about a zone’s average darkness or the amount of detail. <i class="fm-italics">Visual weight</i> means judging both the relative complexity of the design (in this example, <i class="fm-italics">complexity</i> means how many lines are in each quadrant) as well as the <i class="fm-italics">size</i> of the shapes (larger shapes weigh more). Those factors must be considered in tandem.</p>
<p class="body">Others will say, by that rule, any subdivided space will be automatically balanced because fewer lines create larger spaces, and vice versa. In some pages, this will be true, but if you eliminate the line complexity, the result can be unwanted symmetry. Look at figure 6.4 where removing lines in the upper-left quadrant generates a blatant symmetry. Compare this to figure 6.3 to see this difference.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="409" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH06_F04_Mansfield.png" width="714"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 6.4 Remove lines in this design, and symmetry is inevitable.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">You can go further in analyzing balance by dividing the page diagonally—thus displaying four triangular shapes. And, of course, we’re simplifying things here by only considering straight lines, grayscale, and rectangles. Curves and other nonrectangular shapes certainly play a role, as do color, typography, and other factors. Over time, you can train your eyes to look for both symmetry and balance. Some people find that squinting helps to see the overall relationships between the areas of an image.</p>
<p class="body">Now, let’s get back to the answer the earlier question regarding the symmetry in figure 6.2. The symmetry in the original page is created by the horizontal line right through the middle, which results in a top half and a bottom half of equal size.</p>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-152"/>In nature photography there is often a major dividing line that separates the sky from the ground. It’s called the <i class="fm-italics">horizon line</i>. Professional photographers believe that framing the shot with that line in the exact middle is bad practice. It’s one kind of symmetry. Among other things, a horizon in the exact middle means you’re giving equal weight to the sky and the earth, as if you couldn’t make up your mind which should predominate.<a id="idIndexMarker049"/></p>
<p class="body">Think of it this way: if you locate the horizon line higher in the frame, you allow the earth to dominate the picture, and hopefully the most effective visual (the focal point) is found within that space. The viewer starts by looking at the focal point within the dominant zone, and then moves up to the sky later, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="body">If you find it too challenging to achieve a good compromise between total symmetry and an unbalanced composition, what can you do? Who do you call? GPT and others are quite happy to pose as art critics.</p>
<p class="body">You can upload an image for GPT to view and critique. And you can even ask it to modify the image for you and return the improved version to you as a download. Let’s try that:</p>

<p class="fm-exercise">Balance in Composition:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">The composition is well-balanced with elements that guide the viewer’s eye across the scene. The two cranes form a natural point of interest and are balanced by the cluster of vibrant flowers on the left. The sunlight filtering through the trees creates a radiant point that contrasts with the cooler tones of the water and foliage, aiding in the balance.</p><!--<p class="fm-exercise-break">  </p>-->
<p class="fm-exercise">Avoidance of Symmetry:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">The composition has avoided strict symmetry, which contributes to a more dynamic and natural scene. While there are symmetrical elements, like the two cranes and the reflection on the water, they are offset by the uneven distribution of trees, flowers, and light. This asymmetry provides a sense of natural randomness and avoids the rigidity that can come with perfect symmetry.</p><!--<p class="fm-exercise-break">  </p>-->
<p class="fm-exercise">Focal Point:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">The clear focal points are the two cranes in the water. They are centrally located and are a point of contrast against the darker background of the water and trees. Their reflection in the water also enhances their prominence in the composition.</p><!--<p class="fm-exercise-break">  </p>-->
<p class="fm-exercise">Potential for Cropping:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">While the composition is already strong, cropping can be used to emphasize certain elements. For example, a crop that brings the cranes slightly off-center could enhance the dynamism of the composition, possibly adhering to the rule of thirds. Cropping out some of the right side might also focus the scene more on the cranes and the sunlight behind them.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Let’s try a crop to see if we can shift the focus slightly and adhere more closely to the rule of thirds for an even more engaging composition. I’ll make the adjustments and show you the result.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">The image has been cropped to potentially enhance the composition by bringing the focal points—the cranes—slightly off-center and adhering to the Rule of Thirds.

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_12">6.7.3 It went haywire</h3>
<p class="body">GPT’s first attempt at cropping was irrational, chopping almost 50% off the image! It didn’t follow its own advice in its text response. Instead of moving the cranes slightly off-center as it recommended, GPT removed the cranes entirely! So we went back and forth through three more efforts, chatting, with me asking it to follow its text suggestions, which were good. Finally, I told it to “take your time” and “do what you said to do.” And then GPT did take about twice as much time as the previous efforts. And it succeeded by finally giving me the crop shown in figure 6.5.<a id="idIndexMarker053"/><a id="idIndexMarker054"/><a id="marker-154"/></p>

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 6.5 GPTimproved this composition by effective cropping. The white lines show where the image was cropped.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">To sum up the main point of this section: try to achieve balance in your composition, but avoid taking the lazy approach by simply resorting to a strictly symmetrical design. That would be balanced all right, but boring, inert. And even if you’re comfortable with your results, it never hurts to ask an AI for its opinion.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_13">6.7.4 White space versus negative space</h3>
<p class="body">The previous Mondrian examples don’t take into account the background that usually separates content zones in a web page. There are two kinds of separation: white space and negative space. Both are important design concepts that are related, and although often used interchangeably, there is a traditional distinction. Negative space is sometimes enclosed <i class="fm-italics">within</i> content; white space is connected to other white space areas. What does this mean?<a id="idIndexMarker055"/><a id="idIndexMarker056"/><a id="idIndexMarker057"/><a id="idIndexMarker058"/></p>
<p class="body"><i class="fm-italics">Negative space</i> refers to the space between the content. In other words, whatever isn’t positive space (content such as paragraphs or images). It’s sometimes used to create shapes or patterns that can enhance the composition or convey additional meaning. Negative space isn’t necessarily white or even a single color. It’s the background.<a id="idIndexMarker059"/></p>
<p class="body">As you can see in figure 6.6, FedEx’s logo is an example of negative space used to send a message. The space between the E and X creates an arrow, symbolizing rapid delivery, I guess.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="142" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH06_F06_Mansfield.png" width="441"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 6.6 For most people, the arrow here is a subliminal message.</p>
</div>
<p class="body"><i class="fm-italics">White space</i>, by contrast (also known as <i class="fm-italics">blank space</i> or <i class="fm-italics">empty space</i>), refers to margins, padding, or the space between columns, lines of type, graphics, images, or the other design elements. White space comes from print design—the unprinted parts of a book page, such as the margins. It’s purpose isn’t to send subliminal messages like negative space, but rather to help balance the layout and improve readability.<a id="idIndexMarker060"/><a id="idIndexMarker061"/><a id="idIndexMarker062"/></p>
<p class="body">White space doesn’t actually have to be white; it’s merely the areas that are free of text or media. The purpose of white space is to give the elements in your design room to breathe, or to avoid visual overload by breaking the page up into chunks of text. White space can also help guide your visitor’s eye around the page.</p>
<p class="body">The primary difference between negative space and white space is that negative space is used conceptually to create a shape or enhance the meaning of a design. But white space is more of a practical feature. White space should be used to make a web page look more inviting.</p>
<p class="body">People are usually put off by massive blocks of gray text. They’ll feel like you’re giving them an assignment. So, you want your text to be in paragraphs, separated by white space, and in sufficiently narrow columns so that the reader doesn’t have to struggle to locate the start of each next line.<a id="idIndexMarker063"/><a id="marker-155"/><a id="idIndexMarker064"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_14">6.8 Using the rule of thirds</h2>
<p class="body">The famous rule of thirds is an excellent tool to help you achieve asymmetrical balance on your site’s pages. It also drives the viewer’s eye to the most important location in your page (the subject of the page, the focal point). <a id="idIndexMarker065"/><a id="idIndexMarker066"/></p>
<p class="body">When working on visual compositions—photographs, paintings, or web pages—the rule of thirds is a fundamental principle widely applied by visual artists. It was first proposed in the 18th century in a 1797 book titled <i class="fm-italics">Remarks on Rural Scenery</i> by John Thomas Smith.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_15">6.8.1 Mastering cropping to emphasize the focal point</h3>
<p class="body">The rule of thirds divides a page or painting into nine equal parts by superimposing two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines. <i class="fm-italics">Cropping</i> is commonly used by artists to improve an image. And you can best follow the rule of thirds by cropping (as illustrated previously in figure 6.5 with the cranes).<a id="idIndexMarker067"/><a id="idIndexMarker068"/><a id="idIndexMarker069"/><a id="marker-156"/><a id="idIndexMarker070"/></p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">
<p class="fm-sidebar-title">Cropping and outpainting</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text"><i class="fm-italics">Cropping</i> means trimming the edges off an image—chopping off some content from one or more of the sides. This can do several things: change the aspect ratio (the shape of the image), reframe the image, or—as in our next example—improve the composition and highlight the main focal point by using the rule of thirds. <a id="idIndexMarker071"/></p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text"><i class="fm-italics">Outpainting</i>—only possible now that AI can manipulate visu<a id="idTextAnchor006"/>als—is the opposite of cropping. With outpainting (aka <i class="fm-italics">extended canvas</i> or <i class="fm-italics">edge expansion</i>), you upload an image and then ask that one or more sides of the image be <i class="fm-italics">extended</i> (rather than trimmed, as when cropping). How can this work? How can you add visual content to an image that wasn’t in the original image? You couldn’t, before AI came along.<a id="idIndexMarker072"/></p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Outpainting <i class="fm-italics">expands</i> the image, creating <i class="fm-italics">new content</i> that reflects the image’s perspective, style, and content. The new content is a variation of the existing content—not merely a copy. (Outpaint a picture of fresh produce, and a bin of bananas might be added to an existing bin of apples.) Outpainting can also be used with the rule of thirds to move the focal point onto a new and expanded grid. Much more on this and other techniques is explored in chapter 7.</p>
</div>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">tip</span> <i class="fm-italics">Aspect ratio</i> refers to the shape of a photo, painting, or other image. Traditionally, landscape images are wider than they are high. Portraits are the opposite—higher than they are wide. A web page, when viewed on a computer monitor, is in landscape mode. A cellphone, is normally in portrait mode, unless you turn the phone 90 degrees to change it to landscape mode. Most computer monitors have a 16:9 aspect ratio, so they are landscape. <a id="idIndexMarker073"/></p>
<p class="body">The most common way to apply the rule of thirds by cropping. Cropping tools are found in any quality photo editor such as Photoshop, Paint.NET, or GIMP. (The latter two are free and can be safely downloaded from <a class="url" href="https://ninite.com">https://ninite.com</a>.)</p>
<p class="body">When you use a cropping tool in a photo editor, grid lines are automatically displayed on the image, superimposing the rule of thirds grid on the image. A good place to locate your focal point is where the grid lines cross.</p>
<p class="body">Figure 6.7 shows how I dragged the crop grid (using the photo editor’s crop tool) until the man’s eyes are on two of the focal points and the mouth is on a grid line. Compare this image to figure 6.8, which shows the result of my crop. To use this tool to balance your website pages, take a screenshot of a page, and load it into your photo-editing application.</p>

<p class="body">The rule of thirds grid will show you how to improve the positioning of your web page’s focal point (a photo of a painting you’re trying to sell or the main headline)—whatever you want your visitors to notice first. Then, drag the crop grid until your focal point is on one of the four intersections that the rule of thirds displays. The crop tool will display eight small boxes (drag handles, as shown earlier in figure 6.7) on the edge of the crop grid, any of which can be dragged to reposition the grid lines. By the way, if you didn’t notice a relationship between the hair and the smoke, it’s likely that you have talents other than design.</p>
<p class="body">Alternatively, you can simply locate the focal point somewhere along a grid line. That approach is less powerful, though. The further away your focal point is from the grid’s four intersections, the weaker the effect.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> The following layout recommendations mostly apply to pages on your site that are static (not scrolled) and that are viewed on a typical computer monitor.

<p class="body">Figure 6.9 shows the rule of thirds grid overlaying the painting. The four arrows point to the main focus areas. These are the intersections where the focal point should be positioned. To accomplish that, you drag the crop tool’s handles (the eight small squares on the frame of the grid) until the painting’s focal point is on one of those intersections. The handles can be dragged in various directions to define the crop.<a id="idIndexMarker078"/><a id="marker-158"/><a id="idIndexMarker079"/></p>

<p class="body">The final result, shown in figure 6.11, is a stronger composition. The image now has better overall balance and more depth, sending the viewer’s eye first to the point of interest—that farmhouse. This image is now clearly about a farmhouse, and then secondarily, its context, the valley, and not much at all about the sky.</p>

</div>
<p class="body">However, you might want to crop this a different way because the aspect ratio in the previous image is usually reserved for portraits rather than landscapes. Further cropping (figure 6.12) can change the image into the traditional landscape shape (wider than high). The more you work with the crop tool and its grid, the more you’ll value its usefulness when balancing the overall image and strengthening the focal point.</p>

<p class="body">I can’t argue with that.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_18">6.8.4 Considering some other design rules</h3>
<p class="body">Studies of eye movements have shown that the human eye naturally gravitates toward the intersection points in the rule of thirds grid when looking at images. (People don’t tend to start by looking at the center of a painting or web page.) So the grid works with this natural tendency, leading to more aesthetically pleasing, engaging, dynamic, and balanced images. <a id="idIndexMarker082"/><a id="marker-163"/><a id="idIndexMarker083"/></p>
<p class="body">If you locate your subject right in the middle of the screen, that tends to deaden the image, making it more static. The result usually suffers from a lack of dynamism similar to rigidly symmetrical layouts. Locating the subject off-center tends to result in a more forceful, alive, and just plain attractive image.</p>
<p class="body">Are there other design rules? Yes, there are several (triangles, diagonals, alternative grids). One of the most well-known rules is called the golden ratio (or golden spiral). It’s a mathematical progression seen in nature in sunflowers, DNA, and nautilus seashells, as shown in figure 6.16.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="413" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH06_F16_Mansfield.png" width="738"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 6.16 The famous golden ratio emerges in nature but is also used in art, architecture, fashion, and film. This shell was generated by AI. And it couldn’t exist in nature. Can you see why not?</p>
</div>
<p class="body">If you’re curious about how to apply the golden ratio, Photoshop has another cropping grid that will assist you. Or you can use this formula: a/b = 1.618. For example, if your building is 25 feet wide (b), then the height (a) should be approximately 25 × 1.618 = 40.45.</p>
<p class="body">A related rule is called the Fibonacci spiral (sequence or curve). Both the <i class="fm-italics">Girl with a Pearl Earring</i> and the <i class="fm-italics">Mona Lisa</i> are built on this pattern. It can be constructed by a series of squares whose lengths are Fibonacci numbers. Drawing arcs from opposite corners of each square within a frame creates a curve resembling a spiral, leading the viewer’s eye around the picture. Typically, the greatest detail is located in the smallest of the boxes. This rule is like a whirlpool and produces only that one focal point. <a id="idIndexMarker084"/></p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">
<p class="fm-sidebar-title">Preserving image style or character with Midjourney</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Another rule to keep in mind is <i class="fm-italics">simplicity.</i> Modern design taste tends toward minimalism. A minimalistic website page is usually best, unless you’re selling quilts or something. Upload a shot of your web page, and ask Midjourney (using the <code class="fm-code-in-text">--sref</code> feature with <code class="fm-code-in-text">–sw</code> set to <code class="fm-code-in-text">800</code>) or GPT to revise the image to make it more minimalist.<a id="marker-164"/><a id="idIndexMarker085"/></p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Midjourney’s <code class="fm-code-in-text">--sref</code> feature is powerful. It means <i class="fm-italics">style reference</i>. To use it, you upload an image (or several), and Midjourney creates new images in the style of the submitted images. You can adjust the amount of influence of the uploaded images by using the <code class="fm-code-in-text">–sw</code> (style weight) parameter. Give <code class="fm-code-in-text">–sw</code> a number between 0 and 1,000.<a id="idIndexMarker086"/><a id="idIndexMarker087"/></p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">There is a related parameter called <code class="fm-code-in-text">––cref</code>, for <i class="fm-italics">character reference</i>. It defaults to <code class="fm-code-in-text">100</code> unless you use the <code class="fm-code-in-text">–cw</code> (character weight) parameter, which can be set from <code class="fm-code-in-text">0</code> to <code class="fm-code-in-text">100</code>. At <code class="fm-code-in-text">100</code>, the resulting images will replicate the clothing, hair, facial features, and even accessories of the uploaded images. But a<a id="idTextAnchor007"/>t <code class="fm-code-in-text">0</code>, only the face is copied, and clothing and other elements are not.<a id="idIndexMarker088"/><a id="idIndexMarker089"/></p>
</div>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">ANSWER</span> The shell in figure 6.16 is like an Escherian staircase. It starts in the center of the shell as an interior view, but gradually flips over to become an exterior view as you circle outward. As you can see, Midjourney is perfectly capable of generating images even in the complex style of an artist such as Escher.</p>
<p class="body">All this being said, rules are made to be broken, so you can make exceptions if you’re sensitive to composition and design in general. If anyone has earned the right to break rules, it’s Leonardo da Vinci. He actually centers Mona Lisa horizontally within the frame. But he does follow the rule of thirds in several ways, including locating that smile on a grid line.</p>
<p class="body">One final focal point example: Midjourney was asked to create a painting in the style of Mondrian, but to follow the rule of thirds very strictly. In figure 6.17, notice the eight white marks indicating the position of the grid lines. The four additional marks indicate the midpoints.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 6.17 This super-strict application of the rule of thirds creates quite a few symmetries.</p>
</div>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-165"/>Figure 6.18 shows how overly strict adherence to the rule of thirds produces many symmetrical rectangles—both in size and position.</p>

<p class="body">If you find page design too much trouble, uninteresting, or impossible, you can ask someone who works with visuals to review your site and make suggestions. Or, as always, consult AI for suggested improvements. Systems such as GPT have built-in text-to-image capabilities, so you can first upload your page and ask for suggestions. Then, ask it to create a new image that incorporates those suggestions. If you want further modifications, just ask a follow-up question or two as we did when cropping previously. <a id="idIndexMarker090"/><a id="idIndexMarker091"/><a id="idIndexMarker092"/><a id="idIndexMarker093"/></p>

<p class="fm-exercise"><i class="fm-italics">Relevance</i>: The image seems disconnected from the main message of the home page. If “INSTANT POT” is the focus, then the image of raw potatoes does not clearly relate to that theme. Usually, for a cooking or recipe website, one might expect to see the end product, kitchen scenes, or the relevant cooking appliance in use.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise"><i class="fm-italics">Contrast and Visibility</i>: The image has a dark background which contrasts with the overall light and airy feel of the website, making it stand out in a way that does not seem intentional or aesthetically harmonious.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise"><i class="fm-italics">Placement</i>: The image is somewhat awkwardly placed on the bottom right, not integrated with any text or other design elements. It feels like an afterthought rather than a cohesive part of the design.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise"><i class="fm-italics">Size and Proportion</i>: The image is small relative to the size of the leaves and the overall page layout, which diminishes its impact. This can make the viewer unsure of the image’s importance in the context of the site.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise"><i class="fm-italics">Lack of Context</i>: There’s no caption or text around the image to explain why it’s there or what it represents. Is it related to a specific recipe? Is it highlighting the type of ingredients used in the recipes provided?</p>
<p class="fm-exercise"><i class="fm-italics">Quality and Style Consistency</i>: The style of the potato image is a stark photograph which doesn’t match the more stylized and faded approach taken with the leaf image. Consistency in image style is important for brand identity <i class="fm-italics">and overall cohesion.</i></p>

<p class="body"><a id="marker-170"/>This analysis is spot on, GPT. As you’ve seen, AI can make excellent design suggestions. Once you master communicating with AI—how to prompt it and when to ask follow-up questions—AI becomes your primary resource for improving the content of your site—for the writing as well as the design.</p>
<p class="body">In this chapter, you learned the basics of site design. You explored the elements of balance, composition, color, white space, and negative space. You also saw how to employ several design rules. And throughout, AI played a big part in both conceptualizing and finalizing a site’s home page. That home page is the first thing your visitors will see, and it should clearly convey the site’s tone, purpose, and quality. AI’s assistance with this will prove invaluable.</p>
<p class="body">The next chapter takes you into advanced site design. You’ll dive deep into contemporary trends. And you’ll also learn to fine-tune <i class="fm-italics">any</i> element of your theme’s design defaults—everything from layout, to transition animations, to opacity on the Z-axis. To accomplish that, you’ll master the powerful YellowPencil plugin. It writes CSS programming for you automatically. You tell it you want this paragraph red, and YellowPencil writes the code to make it so. No need for you to learn the CSS language yourself. You’re once again in the position of bossing and judging, while letting a plugin or AI carry out the actual slogging and hard work. And, as always, AI will be there at your side to assist in many ways.<a id="idIndexMarker104"/><a id="idIndexMarker105"/></p>

<p class="list">Your site’s design is important—you’ll want your visitors to feel comfortable and impressed with how things look. If design isn’t your thing, ask someone else who understands design (like AI) for their suggestions. Important considerations include the psychology of color, composition, layout, white space, and design rules such as the rule of thirds and the golden ratio.</p>
