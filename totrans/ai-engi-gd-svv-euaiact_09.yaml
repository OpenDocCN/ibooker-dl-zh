- en: Data products are curated outputs derived from raw data that provide value to
    end users, typically in the form of insights, actionable information, or analytics.
    They are created through various stages of the data engineering lifecycle, including
    ingestion, storage, transformation, and serving. Data products can take [many
    forms](https://oreil.ly/x9hlV), such as reports, dashboards, machine learning
    models, or APIs.

    This framework supports scalable data governance by guiding the creation of consistent,
    reliable, and well-documented data products. Each data product consists of eight

- en: A critical component of data products from a data governance perspective is
    the [data contract](https://oreil.ly/WxikE). Data contracts are formal agreements
    between data producers (e.g., source system owners, data engineers) and data consumers
    (e.g., analysts, data scientists, business users) that define the expectations,
    responsibilities, and standards for data exchange. They ensure that data consistently
    meets specific agreed-upon quality, format, and delivery requirements.

    and Mark Freeman define these contracts as “a mechanism for expanding software-oriented
    collaboration to data teams, bringing quality to data through human-in-the-loop
    review, just as the same systems facilitated code quality for product teams.”

    defined by governance policies and include requirements for data masking and encryption
    of sensitive data. Specify access control policies and procedures, data handling
    guidelines for different privacy classifications, and relevant compliance requirements
    (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA). Clearly define the roles of data owners, stewards,
    and other governance stakeholders.
