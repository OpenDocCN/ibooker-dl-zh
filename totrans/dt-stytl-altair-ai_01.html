<p>By purchasing this book, you have decided to embark on the stimulating path of combining data storytelling, Python, and generative AI. Likely, you already have some knowledge of data visualization and want to learn new techniques to improve your charts and how to use generative AI in the chart creation process. Simply put, by reading this book, you would like to learn how to do data storytelling using generative AI. I’ll tell you right away that the book isn’t only that—it’s more than just background on data storytelling and generative AI. In fact, throughout the book, you will also learn a methodology that will allow you to create your own data-based stories systematically. So it won’t be another book of code and examples to implement, but here and there, I will give you the theoretical basis for implementing your own data-driven stories. This book is a mix of theory and practice, which will allow you to apply the techniques learned in other contexts. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p9">
<p>The examples you will encounter throughout the book—and in this chapter—will be essential, as they aim to be as simple as possible to understand a working method. At the end of the book, you will realize that rather than having implemented examples, you will have learned a working methodology. Therefore, I ask you not to be disappointed by the simplicity of the examples but to look at the methodology behind them and how you can apply it in your work, which is certainly more complex than the examples described in this book. So let’s start our journey!</p>

<h2 class="readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">1.1</span> The art of data storytelling</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p11">
<p><em>Data storytelling</em> is a powerful way to share data insights by transforming them into narrative stories. It is an art you can use for any industry, such as government, education, finance, entertainment, and healthcare. Data storytelling is not only for data scientists and analysts; it’s for anyone who has ever wanted to tell a story with data.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p12">
<p>To move from data visualization to data storytelling, you need to change perspective. Instead of looking at the data from your point of view, you will have to look at it from the point of view of the people you will tell it to—in other words, the <em>audience</em>. Figure 1.1 shows the journey from data to the intended audience, as viewed through the eyes of both the skilled data scientist (represented on the left)<span class="aframe-location"/> and the eagerly awaiting audience (represented on the right). The flow consists of three major phases: data exploration, analysis, and presentation. The size of each box reflects the amount of time devoted to its respective phase. While data scientists and audiences share a common goal (that is, to grasp the essence of the data truly), how they achieve said goal varies. Data scientists understand data during the data exploration phase, whereas audiences take center stage during data presentation.</p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p14">
<p>Data storytelling can help data scientists and analysts to present and communicate data to an audience. You can think of data storytelling as the grand finale of the data science life cycle. It entails taking the results of the previous phases and transforming them into a narrative that effectively communicates the results of data analysis to the audience. Rather than relying on dull graphs and charts, data storytelling enables you to bring your data to life and communicate insights compellingly and persuasively. Data storytelling gives the audience an opportunity to feel emotions and experience wins and setbacks while pursuing a goal.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p15">
<p>More formally, data storytelling builds compelling stories, supported by data, allowing analysts and data scientists to present and share their insights interestingly and interactively. The ultimate goal of data storytelling is to engage the audience and inspire them to make decisions. In some cases, including business scenarios, data is not the first step; to begin with, you have in mind a narrative or a hypothesis. Then, you search for data that confirms or negates it. In this case, you can still have data storytelling, but you must pay attention not to alter your data to support your hypothesis. Brent Dykes, a well-known consultant in storytelling training, suggests the following approach: “Whenever you start with the narrative and not the data, it requires discipline and open-mindedness. In these scenarios, one source of risk will be confirmation bias. You will be tempted to cherry-pick data that confirms your viewpoint and ignore conflicting data that doesn’t.” (Dykes, 2023) Remember to build your data stories on accurate and unbiased data analysis. In addition, always consider the data you are analyzing.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p16">
<p>Some time ago, I had the opportunity to work on a cultural heritage project on which I had to automatically analyze entities from the transcripts of a registry of names dating back to around 1700–1800. The goal was to calculate some statistics about the people in the register, such as the most frequently appearing name, the number of births by year, and so on. Sitting at my computer, I calculated and visualized data statistics. The project also involved linking these people to their graves to build an interactive cemetery map. At some point in the project, I had the opportunity to visit the cemetery. As I walked through it, the rows upon rows of headstones made me stop. It hit me like a ton of bricks: every name etched into those stones represented a life. Suddenly, the numbers and statistics I had been poring over in my datasets became more than just data points—they were the stories of real people. It was a powerful realization that changed the way I approached my work. That’s when I discovered the true power of data storytelling. It’s not just about creating fancy graphs and charts—it’s about bringing the people behind the data to life. We have a mission to give these people a voice, to ensure that their stories are heard. And that’s exactly what data storytelling does; it gives a voice to people often buried deep within the numbers. Our mission as data storytellers is to bring these stories to the forefront and ensure they are heard loud and clear.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p17">
<p>In this book, you’ll learn two technologies to transform data into stories: Python Vega-Altair (or simply Altair) (<a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/">https://altair-viz.github.io/</a>) and generative AI tools. Python Altair is a Python library for data visualization. Unlike the most known Python libraries, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, Altair is a declarative library where you specify only what you want to see in your visualization. This aspect is beneficial for quickly building data stories without caring about how to build a visualization. Altair also supports chart interactivity, so users can explore data and interact with it directly.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p18">
<p>Generative AI is the second technology you’ll use to build data stories in this book. We will focus on ChatGPT to generate text, DALL-E to generate images, and GitHub Copilot to generate the Altair code automatically. I chose to use GitHub Copilot to generate code, rather than ChatGPT, because Copilot was trained with domain-specific texts, including GitHub and Stack Overflow codes. Instead, ChatGPT is more general purpose. At the time of writing, generative AI is a very recent technology, still in progress, which translates a description of specifications or actions into text.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p19">
<p>Data storytelling is about more than communicating data; it’s about inspiring your audience and inviting them to take action. Good data storytelling requires a mix of art and science. The art is in finding the right story, while the science is in understanding how to use data to support that story. When done well, data storytelling can be a potent tool for change. In the remainder of this section, we’ll briefly cover three fundamental questions about data storytelling. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p20">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">1.1.1</span> Why should you use data storytelling?</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p21">
<p>Data storytelling enables you to convey the results of your data analysis process, using narratives that can be easily understood by an audience. Throughout this book, we will see many examples and case studies. For example, you will see how to transform the raw chart in figure 1.2 into the data story shown in figure 1.3.<span class="aframe-location"/><span class="aframe-location"/></p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p24">
<p>Data storytelling allows you to fill the gap between simply visualizing data and communicating it to an audience. Data storytelling improves your communication skills and standardizes and simplifies the process of communicating results, making it easier for people to understand and remember information. Data storytelling also helps you learn to communicate more effectively with others, improving personal and professional relationships.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p25">
<p>Use data storytelling if you want to do any of the following:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p26"> Focus on the message you want to communicate and make data more understandable and relatable. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p27"> Communicate your findings to others in a way that is clear and convincing. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p28"> Connect with your audience on an emotional level, which makes them more likely to take action. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p29"> Inspire the audience to make better decisions by helping them understand your data more deeply. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p30">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">1.1.2</span> What problems can data storytelling solve?</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p31">
<p>Use data storytelling if you want to communicate something to an audience in the form of writing reports, doing presentations, or building dashboards.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p32">
<h4 class="readable-text-h4">Writing reports</h4>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p33">
<p>Imagine you must write a sales report for a retail company. Instead of presenting raw numbers and figures, you can weave a data story about the performance of different product categories. Start by identifying the most crucial aspects of the data, such as the top-selling products, emerging trends, or seasonal fluctuations. Then, use a combination of visualizations, anecdotes, and a logical narrative flow to present the information.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p34">
<p>You can build a story around your data, such as by introducing a problem, building suspense, and concluding with actionable recommendations. When writing reports, use data storytelling to highlight the most important parts of your data and make your reports more engaging and easier to understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p35">
<h4 class="readable-text-h4">Doing presentations</h4>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p36">
<p>Consider a marketing presentation in which you must demonstrate various marketing campaigns’ effectiveness. Instead of bombarding the audience with numerous charts and statistics, focus on creating a compelling narrative that guides them through how the campaigns unfolded and their impact on the target audience. Finally, show potential next steps to follow. In presentations, use data storytelling to engage your audience and help them understand your message better.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p37">
<h4 class="readable-text-h4">Building dashboards</h4>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p38">
<p>Let’s imagine you are developing a sales performance dashboard for a retail company. Instead of presenting a cluttered interface with overwhelming data, focus on guiding users through a narrative, highlighting key insights. When building dashboards, use data storytelling to build more user-friendly and informative dashboards.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p39">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">1.1.3</span> What are the challenges of data storytelling?</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p40">
<p>Crafting compelling data stories is no easy feat. It demands <em>time</em> to ensure engaging narratives packed with valuable information. Moreover, it is a <em>team effort</em> because it involves bringing together individuals from diverse backgrounds, each with their own expertise and perspectives, to work collaboratively. This collaboration can be challenging, but it’s essential for weaving together a cohesive and impactful data story.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p41">
<p>Creating data stories involves two key challenges: time and teamwork. Investing in these areas is crucial to captivate audiences and effectively communicate insights. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p42">
<p>Now that we’ve covered when to use data storytelling, what problems it can solve, and what makes it unique, we’re ready to consider questions relating to our two tools: Python Altair and generative AI tools. We will do that in the next section.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p43">
<h2 class="readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">1.2</span> Why should you use Python Altair and generative AI for data storytelling?</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p44">
<p>Python provides you with many libraries for data visualization. Many of them, including Matplotlib and Seaborn, are <em>imperative libraries</em>, meaning you must define exactly how you want to build a visualization. Python Altair, instead, is a <em>declarative library</em>, meaning you specify only what to visualize. Using Python Altair for data storytelling instead of other imperative libraries allows you to quickly build your visualizations. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p45">
<p>For example, to plot a line chart using Matplotlib, you must specify explicitly the x and y coordinates, set the plot title and labels, and customize the appearance.</p>
</div>

<div class="code-area-container">
<pre class="code-area">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Square Numbers')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')

plt.show()</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text print-book-callout" id="p47">
<p><span class="print-book-callout-head">Note</span>  The chart builds a line chart in Matplotlib. You must define the single steps to build the chart: (1) set the title, (2) set the x-axis, (3) set the y-axis.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p48">
<p>Declarative visualization libraries, like Altair, enable you to define the desired outcome, without specifying the exact steps to achieve it. For instance, using Altair, you can simply define the data, define the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> variables, and let the library handle the rest, including axes, labels, and styling, resulting in a more concise and intuitive code.</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p49">
<h5 class="listing-container-h5 browsable-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Listing 1.2</span> Declarative library</h5>
<div class="code-area-container">
<pre class="code-area">import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'y': [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]})

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_line().encode(
    x='x',
    y='y'
).properties(
    title='Square Numbers'
)

chart.save('chart.png')</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text print-book-callout" id="p50">
<p><span class="print-book-callout-head">Note</span>  The chart builds a line chart in Altair. You must define the chart type (<code>mark_line</code>), the variables, and the title.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p51">
<p>In imperative Matplotlib, you had to define the axis in a certain way and let the library handle it; however, in the declarative library, you define the code with <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> variables with axis labels and styling so that, as a creator, you can be more specific and directional in the chart you intend to create and expand.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p52">
<p>Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence techniques involving creating new, original content based on patterns and examples from existing data. It enables computers to generate realistic and meaningful outputs, such as text, images, or even code. In this book, we will focus on ChatGPT to generate text, DALL-E to generate images, and GitHub Copilot to assist you while coding:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p53"> <em>ChatGPT</em>—An advanced language model developed by OpenAI. Powered by the GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 model, it is designed to engage in human-like conversations and provide intelligent responses.  </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p54"> <em>DALL-E</em>—A generative AI model created by OpenAI. It combines the power of GPT-3 with image generation capabilities, allowing it to create unique and realistic images from textual descriptions.  </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p55"> <em>GitHub Copilot</em>—A new tool powered by OpenAI Codex that assists you while writing your code. In GitHub Copilot, you describe the sequence of actions that your software must run, and GitHub Copilot transforms it into a runnable code in your preferred programming language. The ability to use GitHub Copilot consists of learning how to describe the sequence of actions. GitHub Copilot is a for-fee tool, but you can apply the concepts described in this book to other popular AI code assistants as well. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p56">
<p>Combining Python Altair and generative AI tools will enable you to write compelling data stories more quickly directly in Python. For example, we can use Copilot to assist us in generating the necessary code snippets, such as importing the required libraries, setting up the plot, and labeling the axes. In addition, Copilot’s contextual understanding helps it propose relevant customization options, such as adding a legend or changing the color scheme, saving time and effort in searching for documentation or examples. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p57">
<p>While generative AI tools are still in their early stages, some promising statistics reveal they increase workers’ productivity. A study by Duolingo, one of the largest language learning apps, reveals that the use of Copilot in their company has increased developers’ speed by 25% (Duolingo and GitHub Enterprise, 2022). Compass UOL, a digital media and technology company, ran another study, asking experienced developers to measure the time it took to complete a use case task (analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment) during three distinct periods: without using AI, before its availability was widespread; utilizing AI tools available through 2022; and employing modern generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT. Results demonstrated that developers completed the tasks in 78 hours before AI, 56 hours with the AI used through 2022, and 36 hours with the new generative AI. Compared to the pre-AI era, there is an increase in speed of 53.85% with the new generative AI (figure 1.4).<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">1.2.1</span> The benefits of using Python in all the steps of the data science project life cycle</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p60">
<p>Many data scientists and analysts use Python to analyze their data. Thus, it should be natural to build the final report on the analyzed data in Python. However, data scientists and analysts often use Python only during the central phases of the data science project life cycle. Then, they move to other tools, such as Tableau and Power BI, to build the final report, as shown in figure 1.5. This requires adding other work, which includes exporting data from Python and importing them into the external application. This export/import operation, in itself, is not expensive, but if, while building the report, you realize that you have made a mistake, you need to modify the data in Python and then export the data again. If this process is repeated many times, there is a risk of significantly increasing the overhead until it becomes unmanageable.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p61">

</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p62">
<p>This book enables data scientists and analysts to run each step of the data science project life cycle in Python, filling the gap of exporting data to an external tool or framework in the last phase of the project life cycle, as shown in figure 1.6. The advantage of using only Python is that programmers can build their reports even during the intermediate stages of their experiments, without wasting time transferring data to other tools, such as Tableau or Power BI.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p65">
<p>In general, you can use generative AI as an aid throughout the entire life cycle of a data science project. However, in this book, we will focus only on generative AI in the data presentation phase, which corresponds to the data storytelling phase. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p66">
<p>The introduction of generative AI tools to aid the data presentation phase allows you to devote the effort and time you saved to the data presentation phase, obtaining better results. Thanks to generative AI tools, you can make the audience understand your data (figure 1.7). Now that we’ve discussed the benefits of the tools of choice in this book, we will next briefly discuss contexts in which these tools are not as effective.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

<h2 class="readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">1.3</span> When Altair and generative AI tools are not useful for data storytelling</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p69">
<p>While Python Altair and generative AI tools are handy for building data stories very quickly, they are not useful when analyzing big data, such as gigabytes of data. You should not use them for the following tasks:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p70"> <em>Complex exploratory data analysis</em>—Exploratory data analysis helps data analysts summarize a dataset’s main features, identify relationships between variables, and detect outliers. This approach is often used when working with large datasets or datasets with many variables. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p71"> <em>Big data analytics</em>—Big data analytics analyzes large datasets to uncover patterns and trends. To be effective, big data analytics requires access to large amounts of data, powerful computers for processing that data, and specialized software for analyzing it. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p72"> <em>Complex reports that summarize big data</em> —Generating detailed reports requires robust data processing capabilities and advanced reporting tools, especially when dealing with big data. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p73">
<p>Altair enables you to build charts using datasets of up to 5,000 rows quickly. If the number of rows exceeds 5,000, Altair still builds the chart, but it’s slower. For complex data analytics, use more sophisticated analytics platforms, such as Tableau and Power BI. Though we say this combo is not ideal for big data, if it is feasible to bring your data to below 5,000 rows using data preprocessing, then Altair and generative AI can be a good combo for your storytelling. In addition, consider that you should pay a fee to use generative AI tools, so avoid them if you do not have a sufficient budget.</p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p74">
<h2 class="readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">1.4</span> Using the data, information, knowledge, wisdom pyramid for data storytelling</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p75">
<p>The primary focus of this book is a significant concept known as the <em>data, information, knowledge, wisdom</em> (DIKW) pyramid (figure 1.8), which we believe gives data scientists and analysts the macro steps to build data stories. We’ll cover the DIKW pyramid more extensively in chapter 5. We introduce the DIKW pyramid here because using it to build data stories is a fundamental concept for this text.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

<h5 class="figure-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Figure 1.8</span> The DIKW pyramid</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p77">
<p>The DIKW pyramid provides macro steps to transform data into wisdom, following other intermediate steps, which include information and knowledge. It is composed of the following elements:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p78"> <em>Data</em>—The building block at the bottom of the pyramid. Usually, we start from a significant amount of data, more or less cleaned. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p79"> <em>Information</em>—Involves extracting insights from data. The information represents organized and processed data that are easy to understand. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p80"> <em>Knowledge</em>—Information interpreted and understood through a context that defines the data background. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p81"> <em>Wisdom</em>—The knowledge enriched with specific ethics that invites you to act in some way. Wisdom also proposes the next steps after we understand the data. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p82">
<p>This book describes how to use the elements of the DIKW pyramid as progressive steps to transform your data into compelling data stories. This idea is not new in data storytelling; Berengueres and Sandell proposed this approach (2019). The novelty of this book lies in the combination of the use of the DIKW pyramid, Python Altair, and generative AI. In this section, we will introduce the fundamentals of DIKW that will be applied throughout this book, and we’ll explore how to climb each level of the pyramid.</p>

<p>To turn data into information, extract insights from data. Consider the following scenario: the organizers of an event dedicated to pets are collecting the type of pets that will participate. For each pet category, the organizers advertise the event on specific websites dedicated to that category. The organizers ask you to build a quick report about the current situation. Table 1.1 shows the number of participants and the number of advertised websites, divided by type. First, you focus on the number of participants and build the following bar chart (figure 1.9).<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

<p>Figure 1.9 does not add any insight into table 1.1. It’s simply a visual representation of the table. For some of the data, the table is even clearer than the bar chart.</p>

<p>To turn data into information, start by understanding data. Ask the following questions: </p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p89"> Who is the audience of my story? </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p90"> What information do they want? </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p91"> Are all the data relevant to answer the previous questions? </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p92">
<p>Let’s answer those questions. The organizers of the event are the audience for our story. They want to know the current situation of animals involved in the event. We could suppose they want to elaborate a promotion plan to increase the number of pets participating in the event. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p93">
<p>Looking at the raw data in the table, you notice that the Cat category has the highest number of participants by some margin, followed by a relatively low number of dogs. It seems that owners of other pets, judging by the almost total lack of participants, are not interested in the event. You can use this insight to focus on one of the following options:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p94"> Remove the Other category because it is irrelevant. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p95"> Focus on the Other category, and propose a strategy to increase their participation. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p96">
<p>Let’s focus on the first possible course of action: removing the Other category. Start by calculating the percentage of participants for each category, as shown in table 1.2.</p>

<p>Notice that 88.56% of pets are cats and 10.12% are dogs. Usually, the final audience will not be interested in the finer details, so you can approximate cats at 90% and dogs at 10%. The extracted information—your data’s insight—is that 1 pet out of 10 is a dog, and 9 out of 10 are cats.</p>

<p>Consider the previous example of dogs and cats. You already know that the percentage of cats is greater than that of dogs. Adding context here could involve, for example, describing the events and situations in which motivated dog owners do not participate. Let’s focus on the third column of the dataset, described back in table 1.1 and recalled in table 1.3: the number of advertised websites. For cats, this is 150, and for dogs, it is 28. This information is considered context because it helps the audience understand why the number of cats is higher than the number of dogs. </p>

<p>Consider again the cats and dogs example. To add a call to action, change the title from <em>9 pets out of 10 are cats</em> to <em>Increase the advertising campaign on dog-related websites!</em> Figure 1.12 shows the resulting chart, which adds the call to action to the title.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

<p>The pets scenario demonstrated how to turn data into wisdom. First, we took data that contained the raw number of participants in the event. Then, we extracted information that told us that 1 participant out of 10 is a dog and the remaining 9 are cats. Next, we added a context that explained why dog owners were not interested in the event. The motivation was that the advertising campaign for dogs was poor. Finally, we added a call to action that invited the audience to increase the dog advertising campaign.</p>

<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p127"> Data storytelling is a powerful tool that helps you communicate your data more effectively. When used correctly, data storytelling makes complex data more relatable and easier to understand. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p128"> Data storytelling requires changing your perspective from your point of view to that of the audience. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p129"> Python Altair and generative AI are great tools for creating stunning data stories. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p130"> Don’t use Python Altair and generative AI if you want to perform big data analytics or write complex reports that summarize big data. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p131"> Use the DIKW pyramid to turn your data into wisdom. Start from raw data, and then extract information by adding meaning to data. Next, add context to define knowledge. Finally, include action to provide wisdom. </li>
