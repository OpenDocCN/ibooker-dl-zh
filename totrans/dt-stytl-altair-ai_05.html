<p>When you build a data-driven story, you should consider many aspects: the insight extracted from data; the contextual background behind data; and the next steps connected to data, inviting the audience to do something. The data, information, knowledge, wisdom (DIKW) pyramid helps you consider all these aspects. In this part, you’ll deepen your understanding of all the steps of the DIKW pyramid.</p>

<p>In chapter 5, you’ll consolidate the concepts related to the DIKW pyramid. The first part of the chapter centers on a case study of homelessness and how to transform its data from a raw chart into a data story using the DIKW pyramid. The chapter also introduces some general concepts related to data storytelling, such as the structure of a narrative and the data storytelling arc. In the second part of the chapter, you will implement another case study, based on fake news.</p>

<p>Chapters 6–9 deepen each step of the DIKW pyramid. They implement a single case study: the problem of safety in salmon aquaculture in the United States. At the end of each chapter, you’ll improve this case study with the concepts described in the chapter.</p>

<p>Chapter 6 starts with the bottom of the DIKW pyramid and focuses on turning data into information. You’ll learn some basic techniques to extract and represent insights. The chapter also illustrates how to build the most common chart families: bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and geographical maps.</p>

<p>In chapters 7 and 8, you’ll climb the pyramid by transforming information into knowledge. You’ll learn how to add context to your data story. In chapter 7, you’ll focus on the textual context, and in chapter 8, on the visual context. You’ll also learn advanced concepts, such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. Since these concepts are evolving continuously, it’s possible some may be outdated by the time you read this part. However, the overall theory is still valid, although the code syntax may differ.</p>

<p>In the last chapter of part 2, chapter 9, you’ll reach the top of the DIKW pyramid by transforming knowledge into wisdom. You’ll learn the three main elements of wisdom: knowledge synthesis, experience, and good judgment. You will also use ChatGPT as an additional source of experience.</p>
