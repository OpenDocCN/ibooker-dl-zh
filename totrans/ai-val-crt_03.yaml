    this moment truly is, some things to watch out for, how to become your own fire
    starter (fancy talk for someone who extracts the most value from AI—an AI Value
    Creator, if you will), how to get started, a new mindset for solving problems,
    and more. We’ve given you some technical details, but we think you’ll agree that
    we kept the nerd talk light and came in heavy on the business side. That was all

- en: What compelled Number 28 to say what he said? In 1907, like other parts of the
    world, the US was experiencing an influx of new job types and new workers entering
    the workforce as industrial capitalism was on the rise. New businesses were forming,
    and retail was flourishing with more women entering the workforce. Technology
    was changing business and jobs, and quite simply, things were chaotic to the citizens
    of the US. And while lots of things were changing, technology was a force to be
    reckoned with. All of that came together to create a level of uncertainty and
    angst as technology was being applied to solve problems it had not solved before.
    In their own special way, citizens of that era were waking up to realize that
    every day they had been walking by problems they could solve (or make better)
    with technology. Indeed, some things are timeless.

    data a central part of your strategy (meaning you’re being an AI Value Creator),

    them throughout the book? That said, we will spend a bit of time here talking
    about databecause we think it’s the *most critical* element of the success of
    any AI Value Creator. For all the hype and interest in the market today around
    GenAI and agents—and for good reason—we believe the *only* sustainable competitive
    advantage will come from *your* data. Why? Because if these huge LLMs (like GPT-4.5,
    Gemini. DeepSeek, and so on) are all pretty much trained on the same internet
    data, then most LLMs will commoditize over the “long” (Number 28’s parlance for
    the long term). This means that we will quickly get to a point where the only
    AI that is differentiated in value from any other model for your business will
    be the AI that is further trained, steered, or tuned with your data on your business
    problems. From an LLM perspective, differentiation will emerge along the lines
    of capabilities, trustworthiness, safety, transparency of weights and data, agentic
    properties, and so on. Quite simply, you need to ensure that you appreciate the
    enormous value that lies in your data (the stuff that’s not on the internet for
    vendors to troll and train their AI on). You can’t just give this data away (which
    is why the vendor terms you engage with are critical to understand). This is data
    about better patient outcomes, those who attrite, fraud, buying more, selling
    more, or whatever it is *your* business does, and so on. In fact, we’d go so far
    as to say that models steered with your company’s data are your mic(rophone) drop

- en: Today’s hybrid cloud architecture is focused less on physical connectivity and
    more on supporting the portability of workloads across all environments (public
    cloud, private cloud, and even on premises). Truly, public and private clouds
    are no longer physical “locations” to connect. For example, many cloud vendors
    now offer public cloud services that run in their customers’ on-premises datacenters.
    Private clouds, once run exclusively on premises, are now often hosted in off-premises
    datacenters, virtual private networks (VPNs), virtual private clouds (VPCs), or
    dedicated infrastructure rented from third-party providers (who are sometimes
    public cloud providers). On the productivity theme, *infrastructure as code*(think
    technologies like Terraform with Ansible) lets staff declaratively provision these
    environments with consistency whenever they need to by using compute or cloud
    resources that are located behind or beyond the firewall. This is a big deal for
    AI, and not only because of the build components. It takes on added importance
    with the advent of edge computing, which offers opportunities to improve global
    application performance by moving AI inferencing (running the model) closer to
    where the data is actually collected. Edge computing is probably the one part
    of deployment that is rarely talked about for AI, but we’re starting to see a
    lot of work where inferencing is happening on edge devices. And so, AI, by definition‚
    will be hybrid in terms of where it runs and where the data you need to steer
    it with as an AI Value Creator lives. The takeaway? This is important to appreciate
    because as AI permeates the core of our business process (AI+), interconnected

    He was the 65th US Secretary of State under President George W. Bush—arguably,
    the third highest-ranking position in the US government. He was heard saying his
    now famous line, “Lead so people will follow...if only out of curiosity.” Indeed,
    we’ve seen companies follow out of curiosity alone and end up in some trouble.
    While Powell’s quote has become ubiquitous, what most miss when referencing it
    is the fact that in his speech, he went on to talk about the fact that people
    will do this *if they trust you*. So, when it comes to AI, you must think about
    how you will showcase trust (using AI responsibly) and which technology providers
    show up every day as good actors (upstanders) or bad actors (bystanders). We think
    that matters. So, AI leadership *does not* mean irresponsibly running forward.
    Leadership means responsibly moving an organization forward, and you don’t do
    that on your own. A big part of leadership is mixing wisdom (knowing the right
    path to take) with action. As the old adage goes, “Have the wisdom to know that
    tomato is a fruit and the knowledge not to put it in a fruit salad.” (Yes, we
    know that scientifically, a tomato is a fruit, but from a culinary perspective—upon

    we’re used to in the traditional technology space—which is why it’s so critical
    to finding a balance.

- en: Earlier in this book, we told you that one model will not rule them all. Knowing
    that helps you appreciate why you need to use an open AI platform. You need to
    be able to choose your own models to find the right balance. The best models for
    your business over time will depend on your industry, domain, and use case, plus
    being steered on domain-specific data. In the “long” for business, we think AI
    Value Creator models will produce more value outcomes for your business than AI
    User general-purpose models.

  zh: 在本书的早期，我们告诉过你，没有一个模型可以统治一切。了解这一点有助于你理解为什么你需要使用一个开放的AI平台。你需要能够选择自己的模型以找到合适的平衡。随着时间的推移，最适合你业务的模型将取决于你的行业、领域和用例，以及基于特定领域的数据进行引导。在“长期”的商业中，我们认为AI价值创造者模型将为你的业务产生比AI通用模型更多的价值成果。
- en: One facet of being open is the transparency and openness of the data used to
    train the models you’ll put to work for your business. When you start to ask vendors
    about the data used to train their magical models, some will tell you it’s none
    of your business; others will give you a list of things they *think* they trained
    on; and some will literally show you the provenance of where the data comes from,
    all the pipeline preprocessing that was done to it, the usage rights, and more.
    At the time this book was written, there was a very select group of companies
    that published their data sources and pipelines with full transparency.

  zh: 开放的一个方面是用于训练你将用于商业的模型的数据的透明度和开放性。当你开始向供应商询问用于训练他们神奇模型的训练数据时，有些人会告诉你这不关你的事；其他人会给你一份他们认为训练过的物品清单；还有一些人甚至会向你展示数据的来源，包括对数据进行的所有管道预处理，使用权利，等等。在本书撰写之时，只有少数公司完全透明地发布了他们的数据来源和管道。
- en: To be open, we think you have to start with open data. As we’ve talked about
    earlier in this book, to get the most out of your AI endeavors, you’re going to
    take your own proprietary data to steer or adjust the model you start with for
    your business. That model *could be* open, but for business, it’s more than likely
    it should be built on open and infused with proprietary data (your secret sauce),
    or somewhere in between (like the limited dataset an association works with its
    members to create for the industry it serves). As you hone in on your GenAI strategy,
    we think you should make an open LLM with data transparency part of your plan.
    Why? Being open is a good thing because it makes it much easier to identify sources
    of bias, hate, aggression (and more), it’s good for sovereignty because all the
    data sources are easily identifiable, it’s good for explainability, it’s good
    for legal defensibility, and it’s good for education because it naturally lends
    itself to collaboration among communities.

  zh: 要做到开放，我们认为您必须从开放数据开始。正如我们在本书前面所讨论的，为了最大限度地发挥您的AI努力成果，您将需要使用自己的专有数据来调整或调整您为业务开始的模型。这个模型*可能是*开放的，但对企业来说，更有可能的是它应该建立在开放的基础上，并融入专有数据（您的秘方），或者介于两者之间（例如，一个协会为它服务的行业与会员合作创建的有限数据集）。随着您专注于您的GenAI战略，我们认为您应该将开放LLM和数据透明度纳入您的计划。为什么？开放是好事，因为它使识别偏见、仇恨、侵略（等等）的来源变得容易得多，它有利于主权，因为所有数据源都很容易识别，它有利于可解释性，有利于法律辩护，并且有利于教育，因为它自然地促进了社区之间的合作。
- en: The second aspect of being open for AI is open source. Open source communities
    don’t get the credit they deserve, but they have done more for the world than
    you can imagine. They are where collaboration and innovation happen, and this
    is why we introduced you to Hugging Face in [Chapter 1](ch01.html#ch01_ai_to_ai_generative_ai_and_the_netscape_moment_1740182043982974).
    There are open source models and proprietary models, and you will likely use both.
    In this context, your platform must be open such that you can mix and match the
    right models. For example, if an industry generates an LLM that’s tuned for insurance,
    it might be paid for—but it’s open in that it can be used on a platform, and it’s
    transparent in the data used to build it. Find the companies that are coalescing
    around open. Many of them are part of the [AI Alliance](https://thealliance.ai)—a
    community of technology creators, developers, and adopters collaborating to advance
    safe, responsible AI rooted in open innovation.

  zh: AI开放的第二个方面是开源。开源社区没有得到应有的认可，但它们为世界做出的贡献比你想象的要多。它们是协作和创新发生的地方，这就是为什么我们在[第一章](ch01.html#ch01_ai_to_ai_generative_ai_and_the_netscape_moment_1740182043982974)中向您介绍了Hugging
    Face。这里有开源模型和专有模型，您可能会使用两者。在这种情况下，您的平台必须是开放的，这样您就可以混合匹配正确的模型。例如，如果一个行业生成一个针对保险的LLM，它可能需要付费——但它在这个平台上是开放的，因为它可以被使用，并且它在构建它所使用的数据上是透明的。找到那些围绕开放聚集的公司。其中许多公司是[AI联盟](https://thealliance.ai)的一部分——一个由技术创造者、开发者和采用者组成的社区，他们合作推进基于开放创新的、安全、负责任的AI。
