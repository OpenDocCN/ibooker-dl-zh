    this moment truly is, some things to watch out for, how to become your own fire
    starter (fancy talk for someone who extracts the most value from AI—an AI Value
    Creator, if you will), how to get started, a new mindset for solving problems,
    and more. We’ve given you some technical details, but we think you’ll agree that
    we kept the nerd talk light and came in heavy on the business side. That was all
    by design, and this chapter is no different.

    Dr. Jason Hickel, whose research focuses on the global political economy, inequality,
    and ecological economics. He remarked, “Today, nearly every government in the
    world, rich and poor alike, is focused single-mindedly on gross domestic product
    (GDP) growth. This is no longer a matter of choice.”

    which the choices have pretty much been preselected for you if you want to thrive.
    And to truly understand this, you must appreciate why AI is so critical to future

    people “disturbed, confused, [and] bewildered”—truly, we are in a time when society
    is experiencing some sort of disorientation and fear due the complexities of modern
    life. This era’s “many voices of council”contrast with “but few voices of vision,”meaning
    there are lots of opinions but there is not a lot of forward-thinking business
    leadership (which we hope this book provides). Finally, “feverish activity” might
    lend itself to the need to find a societal common point of direction in a world

    quote is attributed to Woodrow Wilson in his Princeton University baccalaureate
    address—in 1907, just a few short years before he would become “Number 28,” the
    28th president of the United States.

    world, the US was experiencing an influx of new job types and new workers entering
    the workforce as industrial capitalism was on the rise. New businesses were forming,
    and retail was flourishing with more women entering the workforce. Technology
    was changing business and jobs, and quite simply, things were chaotic to the citizens
    of the US. And while lots of things were changing, technology was a force to be
    reckoned with. All of that came together to create a level of uncertainty and
    angst as technology was being applied to solve problems it had not solved before.
    In their own special way, citizens of that era were waking up to realize that
    every day they had been walking by problems they could solve (or make better)
    with technology. Indeed, some things are timeless.

    any AI Value Creator. For all the hype and interest in the market today around
    GenAI and agents—and for good reason—we believe the *only* sustainable competitive
    advantage will come from *your* data. Why? Because if these huge LLMs (like GPT-4.5,
    Gemini. DeepSeek, and so on) are all pretty much trained on the same internet
    data, then most LLMs will commoditize over the “long” (Number 28’s parlance for
    the long term). This means that we will quickly get to a point where the only
    AI that is differentiated in value from any other model for your business will
    be the AI that is further trained, steered, or tuned with your data on your business
    problems. From an LLM perspective, differentiation will emerge along the lines
    of capabilities, trustworthiness, safety, transparency of weights and data, agentic
    properties, and so on. Quite simply, you need to ensure that you appreciate the
    enormous value that lies in your data (the stuff that’s not on the internet for
    vendors to troll and train their AI on). You can’t just give this data away (which
    is why the vendor terms you engage with are critical to understand). This is data
    about better patient outcomes, those who attrite, fraud, buying more, selling
    more, or whatever it is *your* business does, and so on. In fact, we’d go so far

    more on supporting the portability of workloads across all environments (public
    cloud, private cloud, and even on premises). Truly, public and private clouds
    are no longer physical “locations” to connect. For example, many cloud vendors
    now offer public cloud services that run in their customers’ on-premises datacenters.
    Private clouds, once run exclusively on premises, are now often hosted in off-premises
    datacenters, virtual private networks (VPNs), virtual private clouds (VPCs), or
    dedicated infrastructure rented from third-party providers (who are sometimes
    public cloud providers). On the productivity theme, *infrastructure as code*(think
    technologies like Terraform with Ansible) lets staff declaratively provision these
    environments with consistency whenever they need to by using compute or cloud
    resources that are located behind or beyond the firewall. This is a big deal for
    AI, and not only because of the build components. It takes on added importance
    with the advent of edge computing, which offers opportunities to improve global
    application performance by moving AI inferencing (running the model) closer to
    where the data is actually collected. Edge computing is probably the one part
    of deployment that is rarely talked about for AI, but we’re starting to see a
    lot of work where inferencing is happening on edge devices. And so, AI, by definition‚
    will be hybrid in terms of where it runs and where the data you need to steer

    now famous line, “Lead so people will follow...if only out of curiosity.” Indeed,
    we’ve seen companies follow out of curiosity alone and end up in some trouble.
    While Powell’s quote has become ubiquitous, what most miss when referencing it
    is the fact that in his speech, he went on to talk about the fact that people
    will do this *if they trust you*. So, when it comes to AI, you must think about
    how you will showcase trust (using AI responsibly) and which technology providers
    show up every day as good actors (upstanders) or bad actors (bystanders). We think
    that matters. So, AI leadership *does not* mean irresponsibly running forward.
    Leadership means responsibly moving an organization forward, and you don’t do
    that on your own. A big part of leadership is mixing wisdom (knowing the right
    path to take) with action. As the old adage goes, “Have the wisdom to know that
    tomato is a fruit and the knowledge not to put it in a fruit salad.” (Yes, we

    your business. That model *could be* open, but for business, it’s more than likely
    it should be built on open and infused with proprietary data (your secret sauce),
    or somewhere in between (like the limited dataset an association works with its
    members to create for the industry it serves). As you hone in on your GenAI strategy,
    we think you should make an open LLM with data transparency part of your plan.
    Why? Being open is a good thing because it makes it much easier to identify sources
    of bias, hate, aggression (and more), it’s good for sovereignty because all the
    data sources are easily identifiable, it’s good for explainability, it’s good

    with anything that generations before us haven’t dealt with before. And over time,
    it’s evident that technology has *always* been a source of innovation and prosperity
    for people worldwide. Now that you’re almost done reading this chapter, we think
    that collectively, we’ve got a quorum on the notions that AI is the answer to
    our productivity malaise and that responsibility and disruption must coexist.'

    encourage responsibly used technology to flourish. AI will unleash productivity
    that will drive a level of GDP growth that none of us has ever seen! The right
    trusted AI designed for business does just that. And yes, it may mean the evolution
    of jobs in the near term, but we’re confident that like in every lift, shift,
    rift, or cliff technology moment in the past, as upskilling occurs, there will
    be new jobs (ones you never thought of before), markets, and industries. With
    the right vision of applying responsible AI for productivity, we can indeed find
    ourselves again and—at the same time—deliver sustained growth and propensity for
    many years to come.

    is, “Yes.” Now, let’s go on to the next chapter and see how you put AI to work.'
