    of the book, it is time to show it to our audience. This chapter is all about
    taking your data story and getting it to your audience—and doing so in an ethical
    manner. In the first part of this chapter, we’ll focus on the different techniques
    to export a data story. Next, we’ll describe Streamlit, a Python library fully
    integrated with Altair. Streamlit helps you build a complete standalone website
    hosting your Python code. Then, we’ll see some alternative ways to publish your
    story, including techniques to integrate it into some popular tools for data analytics

    with the first point: exporting the story.'

- en: Our journey together has come to an end. Dear reader, I thank you for sharing
    a stretch of the road with me, for trusting me, and for getting to the end of
    the reading. I hope that through this book, you have learned to love data storytelling
    as an effective tool for communicating your data. I also hope that although the
    book is finished, your journey into the world of data storytelling can continue,
    reading other books, perhaps more interesting than this one, updating yourself
    with articles, courses, and anything else good you can find in the world. In the
    book, here and there, I have indicated interesting resources that you can draw
    on, but do not limit your personal research.

    the difficult role of the data storyteller. The task of using them responsibly
    is now up to you. Always have the courage and strength to look for the truth behind
    the data, and after finding it, maintain the desire to delve deeper into it and
    look for it again. I recommend one more thing: never forget to handle the data
    that you gradually tell with care because, behind the data, there are always people
    waiting for someone to tell their story. I wish you all the best and hope to meet
    you again in the future!'

    you already have some knowledge about these tools. This will enable you to enrich

    result of a complete data science project that included some experimentations,
    such as model tracking and evaluation. Use Streamlit to export your data story
    produced in Altair if you need a web application to share it with your audience.

    audience. And after having told the first story, begin to work on the second.
    And then work on the third, and so on, until you become an effective data storyteller.
    Happy work! Happy data storytelling!
