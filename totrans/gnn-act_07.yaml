- en: The evolution of graph neural networks (GNNs) has unlocked a wealth of new possibilities,
    and this part of the book delves into some of the most exciting and complex frontiers.
    We begin by examining spatiotemporal GNNs, which model dynamic graphs that evolve
    over time, along with applications such as pose estimation in motion analysis.
    Next, we tackle the challenge of scaling GNNs to massive datasets, exploring strategies
    to efficiently process industrial-scale graphs while maintaining high performance.
    Finally, we focus on the practical considerations for building and deploying GNN
    projects, including how to create graph data models from nongraph data, perform
    ETL (extract, transform, load) and preprocessing from raw data sources, and construct
    datasets and data loaders with PyTorch Geometric (PyG). Each chapter in this part
    provides actionable insights and tools to master these advanced topics, empowering
    you to unlock the full potential of GNNs in your work.
