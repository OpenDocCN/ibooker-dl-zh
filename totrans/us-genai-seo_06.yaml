    of content. Without AI, writing content from scratch is hard. The writer starts
    with a blank page, and it’s up to them to figure out what the piece should be
    about, what topics it should cover, and in what order. Even if an experienced
    SME is involved to help verify accuracy and relevance, there’s a chance that the
    writer may have overlooked all the topics that should be addressed in the new
    content.

    for non-SME writers that helps them come up with a broad range of topic ideas.
    It can surface relevant ideas for a new piece of content that the writer or even
    an SME may not have thought of. Even if the generative AI tool’s suggestions aren’t
    a great fit or are outright wrong, an SME should be able to recognize easily which
    ones are relevant or could be corrected. This will give writers a great start
    at completing the task in front of them, which offers significant benefits to
    the throughput of content creation and can improve content quality at the same

- en: 'Topic generation is one thing that generative AI tools can do extremely well.
    They can come up with fresh ideas that neither your keyword research nor your
    SMEs will surface. This is potentially of huge value to your SEO program. The
    key insight is that keyword research tools don’t show all the search terms users
    might use when searching for something. The reason they don’t is simple: they
    only sample a small percentage of the traffic on the web and miss most of the
    long-tail search terms that users enter related to your seed term. However, generative
    AI tools use a different dataset and may make different suggestions than you would
    see in traditional keyword research tools. This fits nicely into how Google’s
    algorithms work since Google wants to send traffic to sites that provide the most
    value to users, and covering long-tail topics is part of what you need to satisfy
    a large percentage of your visitors.'
  id: totrans-36

    budget. They may think that the search volume is too low or that the expense of
    creating such content is too high. But consider the [data from Ahrefs](https://oreil.ly/BRWC_)
    that shows that 95% of all keywords are long tail, representing 35% of all search
    volume. That’s a lot of opportunity to leave on the table, especially since long-tail
    keywords tend to be more specific and therefore can have higher conversions than
    other search queries.

    shows that Google monitors user behavior on websites in great detail. We can infer
    from this that Google considers the total user experience on your site and that
    SEO isn’t judged on a simple page-by-page basis. In other words, broad coverage
    of long-tail topics on other pages on your site can help your main pages rank
    for the head terms they target.

    letting generative AI create content for you without human review is ill-advised.

    the steps. For example, perhaps you get generative AI to assist with providing
    topic ideas, relevant user questions, draft outlines, and FAQs. This is already
    a lot of information to equip your writer with input for creating a new piece
    of content.

    multiple versions of its work, review them, and give you a final recommendation.
    You may also want to try to mix and match the different models; for example, have
    ChatGPT-4o generate two versions, optimize its own output, and make recommendations,
    and then have Claude or Gemini take that as input and optimize it further. In
    addition to catching more errors, this advanced technique can be especially helpful
    for things that the models approach differently. For example, ChatGPT is known
    for being more verbose and lacking tone, unlike Claude, which can be more succinct
    and sound more human.

    chapter, but putting many of them into place will help you improve your content
    quality, reduce costs, and increase throughput. It may take some time for your
    writers and SMEs to get used to a modified process and to maximize the benefits
    of incorporating some of these steps into the process. If people are resistant
    to changing an established process, inform them how the modifications will make
    their lives easier.

    generative AI to improve your content development process. These methods offer
    great potential to save costs, increase throughput, and improve quality all at
    the same time. The approaches suggested in this chapter are also designed to leverage
    the strengths of generative AI tools while minimizing the risks associated with
    asking them to do more than they’re capable of doing. This is why we consistently
    stress the importance of human review of AI outputs before deploying those outputs.
