    work well for you. The list contains seven questions, which I hope can help you
    unveil the challenges and opportunities of using AI. The first three questions
    are framed within the context of building an AI-based, production-level product,

    product. The first question is business related. It might seem odd to think about
    business when deciding whether to use AI. However, in my experience, the failure
    to do so leads to many unsuccessful AI projects. So, I think that wondering whether
    there’s a business case for AI is a good place to start. The other two questions
    are technical.

    built accounting software, was looking to add a ChatGPT-based feature to its app,
    but they didn’t know what that could be. He asked me if I could help him come
    up with possible features based on ChatGPT that they could add. I asked him why
    he wanted a ChatGPT-based feature in the first place, and he explained, “We’re
    trying to raise funding, and we cannot tell investors that we’re not using ChatGPT
    for something.”

    FOMO, funding opportunities, and so on, without necessarily knowing what they
    will use AI for. They have a hammer, and they’re searching for nails.

    people don’t really need. A stellar example is the fancy AI-powered supermarket
    checkout technology developed by Amazon. This technology, called “Just Walk Out,”
    was meant to use AI to analyze videos and automatically prepare shoppers’ receipts—the
    shoppers didn’t need to visit a checkout counter.

    problem:'

    didn’t care as much about fancy checkout technology as they cared about finding
    the best shopping deals. A business consultant explained, “Retailers must also
    provide competitive pricing and an enjoyable customer experience. Just Walk Out
    isn’t enough.” … I always struggled to understand what problem Amazon was trying
    to solve for shoppers. Were shoppers really that annoyed about checkouts that
    they’d flock to Amazon Go shops just to avoid it? … If it was about reducing the
    cost of operating a supermarket and thus offer better deals, it was also unclear
    how the technology would accomplish that, as supermarkets with the Just Walk Out
    technology required as many employees to run as regular supermarkets with self-checkout
    machines, plus the cost of installing and running the complicated technology.

- en: The increasing popularity of AI has led many people to adopt an AI-first approach,
    in which they try to find use cases for AI instead of first trying to understand
    what customers want. For example, I know a company that created a team exclusively
    dedicated to finding things to do with AI within the organization. I also know
    companies that hired dozens of people for newly created AI teams without knowing
    exactly what these teams would do with AI—they thought that, as AI seemed so promising,
    they would surely find something to do with it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another example of an AI-first approach is a large portion of the self-driving
    car industry. Many self-driving car companies were born because people observed
    that AI had become much more powerful at image categorization, thanks to convolutional
    neural networks. So, they thought it was the right time to develop self-driving
    cars, and they raised billions from investors promising big profits. In many cases,
    however, these startups didn’t know which problem self-driving cars would solve
    for customers, or how they’d turn them into commercially viable products. Often,
    the approach was, “If you build it, they will come.”

    sometimes, it goes against prevailing wisdom in the fields of entrepreneurship
    and innovation. These fields have increasingly adopted a customer-centric approach.
    For example, the popular *lean* movement suggests one should build a minimal product
    early on—perhaps a prototype or a mock-up—to show to customers and learn about
    their genuine needs before going all-in on a solution.

    if you’re asked to build an AI-based product because AI is trendy, if possible,
    go back to the drawing board to understand what the real need is and whether an
    AI-based product is the best way to address it.

    be a big deal. Maybe they wouldn’t be as in the example of hotel reviews, so using
    AI would be just fine. In other cases, hallucinations might be a problem, as in
    the McDonalds story. In this case, you’ll have to decide whether using AI is such
    a good idea in the first place, as it might end up killing the product if customers
    find it unacceptable. Or, perhaps, you might be able to reformulate the task in
    a way that makes hallucinations more acceptable.

    disappointment (and potentially disaster) for users when it sometimes hallucinates.
    If, however, you frame it as “run your contract through this tool to help you
    find mistakes that you may have overlooked,” then hallucinations might be okay,
    as users will now understand that it’s just a tool to double-check the contract
    and perhaps discover unnoticed mistakes.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Companies love using machine learning to make predictions about all sorts of
    things, such as whether a client will buy a product or an industrial machine will
    need replacement soon. This is usually done by training a machine learning model
    on historical data. The richest and most complex types of models often yield the
    highest predictive performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But clients are sometimes very sensitive when it comes to understanding how
    predictions are generated. In some cases, this is because they don’t want to take
    a leap of faith and trust the model, even if a metric shows that it’s accurate.
    In other cases, they want to understand predictions to derive more insights from
    the model. For example, they may want to understand *why* a product is likely
    to be bought.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The more complex an ML model is, the more it turns into a black box and the
    harder it is to explain how its outputs are generated. So, the most accurate models
    are sometimes not appreciated much by clients who want to understand the outputs.
    This problem becomes even more pronounced when using deep learning models, including
    LLMs and CNNs, which contain many layers of processing and millions or billions
    of parameters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, before using AI, I recommend that you try to find out how much your client
    requires *explainability.* If explainability isn’t important, then using the most
    advanced AI models might be the best choice, and you can check this item off the
    list. However, if you need explainable outputs, you might have to use a simpler
    model, such as a linear one, even if its performance is worse. Or you may want
    to formulate the problem differently, such as conducting an analytical or statistical
    study instead of building a predictive model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, if you still want to use a complex model, you may want to try
    to use a technique to explain some aspects of how it works. There’s a whole field
    of study called *explainable AI* or just XAI. Many of these techniques, such as
    a popular one called SHAP ([https://shap.readthedocs.io/](https://shap.readthedocs.io/)),
    work by identifying which inputs are the ones the model relies on the most to
    generate its output. While these techniques reveal aspects of how ML models work,
    they don’t provide a full explanation of how outputs are generated, so they might
    be underwhelming in some cases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    example, they have developed methods to analyze attention scores inside transformers
    ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12874](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12874)). It’s still
    very early days though. We still have no solid understanding of how large ML models

    to use AI as an assistant to help you perform a task. We focus on conversational

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other tasks are much more difficult to describe as they require a detailed,
    step-by-step specification of the solution. In these cases, writing the prompt
    might be as cumbersome as writing the code itself. For example, I once had to
    use a library called GraphHopper, which contains algorithms to find the shortest
    route between landmarks in a map, but I had to customize it to measure distances
    in a nonstandard way. For that, we had to use a custom formula we had designed
    together with the client. The requirements were so specific and custom, that I’m
    not sure I would have saved any time by writing a prompt and having an LLM write
    the code. So, if your answer to the question “Can I describe the task succinctly?”
    is yes, there are higher chances that AI will help you solve the problem (see
    table 4.2 at the end of this section). As AI hallucinates sometimes, it’s also
    important that you ask yourself the second question, “Can I validate the output
    easily?”, especially if you’re sensitive about the correctness of the output (see
    section 4.1.2).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some tasks can be validated easily. For example, if you already know how to
    perform the task, and all you want is to save time, you can rely on your expertise
    to quickly validate AI’s output. For example, I often forget how to use the Boto3
    library to read files from S3\. So, I often ask ChatGPT how to do it. Because
    I’ve already done it before and it just involves a couple of lines of code, I
    can easily look at ChatGPT’s code and verify that it’s correct. I can also quickly
    run the code to see if it fetches the required S3 file correctly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To cite another example, if you ask an LLM whether a piece of code can be optimized,
    you can easily check whether its recommendations make sense to you, especially
    if you have coding experience and have studied things such as computational complexity.
    Or if you ask ChatGPT to rewrite a piece of code in another programming language,
    you can also verify the output if you’re familiar with the target language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other cases, validating AI’s output is not as quick or easy. For example,
    suppose you ask ChatGPT to write a SQL query that requires plenty of joins and
    business logic. Understanding the resulting query step by step may be cumbersome
    and take as much time as writing the query yourself. Or, if you ask ChatGPT to
    write code in a language you don’t know, you might have a hard time debugging
    it.

    human logo designer? Well, it depends. If you speak with a high-end logo designer,
    you’ll discover that they perform thorough research about competitors’ logos and
    the sentiment they convey. Afterward, they design a logo that is truly original
    and not a rehash of previous logos—something AI isn’t great at—but at the same
    time somehow matches the style of competitors’ logos. This helps customers quickly
    get an idea of what the brand is about as they recognize the type of logo from
    competitors, while still giving your company’s logo a distinctive look.

- en: Depending on your requirements, you may or may not need the thoroughness of
    high-end logo design. For example, if you’re launching a startup, all you may
    need is a logo to fill in the space on your website as it may be too early to
    spend money on a higher-end design. Once the company grows and starts having repeat
    customers, you may want to hire a specialist to design a logo that will better
    position your company in the competitive landscape. Before we move on to the next
    section, you’ll find a summary of questions and possible answers, plus their implications
    in table 4.2.

- en: 'As LLMs can tackle so many tasks, it is now tempting to build software products
    in a new way: Your code transforms the task into a natural-language prompt and
    makes an LLM do it. For example, if your app must show a list of nearby restaurants
    to the user based on their location, your code automatically crafts a prompt such
    as, “Create an HTML table listing the five restaurants closest to [the user coordinates
    are inserted here]. Each row should represent a restaurant, and the columns should
    be: The restaurant name, the cuisine style…” Afterward, your app uses an LLM to
    perform the task, and it parses the LLM’s output before displaying the restaurants
    to the user.'
  prefs: []

- en: When coding this way, apps become sophisticated LLM wrappers—they manage the
    LLM, which is in charge of doing the heavy-duty work under the hood. I’ve met
    many early-stage startups that built or tried to build their initial products
    this way. They thought it wasn’t necessary to code the core functionality of their
    apps when you could just craft a prompt and have an LLM do the work instead.

    travel details in a structured format by selecting the dates on a calendar and
    the destination from a list. The tool would then produce a structured sightseeing
    itinerary displayed in a timeline and a map. Note that this wasn’t a chatbot—the
    user didn’t converse with the app at any point by writing or reading free-form
    text.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to the popularization of LLMs, the company decided to build this feature
    using an LLM under the hood. The user’s request was first transformed into a natural-language
    prompt, such as, “Create a day-by-day itinerary to visit Paris from July 1st to
    July 7th…” The overall prompt was lengthy, as it contained instructions on how
    to output the itinerary in a specific format so it could be easily parsed and
    rendered in the app.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The startup struggled to make this work. One of the reasons was that the LLM’s
    output often included outdated information, such as a suggestion to visit an attraction
    that didn’t exist anymore or at a time during which it was closed. Moreover, the
    LLM’s output sometimes didn’t fully respect the required structure. For example,
    it would sometimes indicate an attraction’s street address where its web address
    should be. In addition, it all took over a minute to run, which is too long by
    today’s browsing standards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The startup then realized that the problem it was trying to solve wasn’t related
    to natural language in any way—the user didn’t type in the inputs as free-form
    text (“I’d like to visit Paris”) and the outputs weren’t shown to the user as
    text either. So why use LLMs at all?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The startup ended up solving the problem differently: after the user made a
    query, the software searched for relevant attractions in the required destination
    using the Google Places API, which provides up-to-date and structured information
    about attractions, such as opening hours and coordinates. Afterward, the software
    ran a pathfinding algorithm to create an ideal sightseeing itinerary from those
    attractions. The solution ran much faster and solved the problem better.'

- en: If users will interact with your product through natural language, using an
    LLM might be the best choice (see table 4.3 at the end of this section), as LLMs
    are specially designed to process and produce natural language. For example, if
    you’re building a customer-service chatbot, then using LLMs may be the best choice
    because they’re designed to process written, free-form requests and generate convincing
    prose. In this case, you exploit what LLMs are best at.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When users will not interact with your product using natural language, such
    as in the travel app, you may want to think twice before using an LLM to solve
    it. If you use an LLM, you may not enjoy its benefits, and you’ll have to cope
    with its drawbacks, such as long execution time, hallucinations, and unstructured
    outputs. In those cases, old-school software, such as a database look up, may
    do a better job. So, if your task does not involve natural language, analyze first
    whether other tools could be more suitable for the job before building an LLM
    wrapper.

    under the hood, which is managed by the app. This is most powerful when you’re
    dealing with a natural-language problem, either because the user inputs free-form
    text or the system must generate human-readable text. If your problem doesn’t
    involve natural language, maybe using old-school algorithms instead of building
    LLM wrappers will be a better choice.
