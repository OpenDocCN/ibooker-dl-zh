- en: When I decided to write this book, I wanted to give you a chance to understand
    the history of Tableau. I also wanted to give you a grounding and understanding
    of what artificial intelligence (AI) is. And finally, I wanted to address the
    impacts of this new technology, not only in analytics but also in the world. My
    goal in these decisions is to ensure that we are on the same page throughout the
    book, we are speaking the same language, and we’re addressing some important issues
    early on so that they aren’t neglected. Often I’ve found in our profession, the
    lack of saying things leads to confusion or the prolonging of important discussions,
    so instead, let’s get started.

- en: Tableau was founded in 2003 as a by-product of a Stanford research project and
    dissertation. The key innovation behind the software is VizQL, a visual query
    language that allows those working with data to drag and drop fields in data sets
    on a canvas to query and answer questions. It’s a very intuitive system because
    all in-depth coding and manipulation of the data is done within the VizQL engine,
    and the person dragging and dropping gets direct visual feedback in the form of
    charts and graphs. I was first introduced to this technology around 2015, and
    to date I haven’t seen a more intuitive way to analyze and work with data.
  prefs: []

- en: In 2007, the software expanded to include Tableau Server—a way to host and publish
    visualizations to true audience members and end users (not just those who create
    the charts)—and Tableau Reader, a free application that allowed anyone to access
    and open Tableau files, called *workbooks*, locally. This improvement paved the
    way for what is a big part of modern analytics, the idea of *self-service analytics*.
    With the inclusion of these two products, now someone could build charts and share
    them with anyone who was looking to use data as an aid in decision making or understanding.
    The responsibility and cycle of reaching out to a data analyst for answers to
    data-related questions was shifted back to the end user, with the goal that they
    become more empowered and able to answer their own questions, to explore the data,
    and to know it more intimately.

- en: 'From 2007 to 2016, Tableau continued to improve upon its core product, Tableau
    Desktop. Some of the most powerful innovations at the time were the inclusion
    of connectors to a myriad of databases and data sources. Data professionals using
    the tool could connect to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets with hand-constructed budget
    numbers and could also connect to larger databases holding transactional data.
    To this day, Tableau continues to be unique in the data tools landscape because
    it takes what I like to call a *data agnostic* approach. Most business intelligence
    (BI) tools thrive on connecting to specific data sources (like Microsoft’s legacy
    SSRS and SSAS) within an application stack (Microsoft), somehow making the visual
    analytics component the last step in the process. Tableau upends this paradigm
    by taking the data as it is, wherever it is, squarely aiming to make the job of
    the data analyst easier: easier to access data, analyze it, understand it, and
    disseminate it.'

- en: Beyond the continued improvements in data connectivity, Tableau added in the
    ability to construct *level of detail*(*LOD*)*expressions* in version 9\. This
    gave Tableau visualization creators the ability to define unique aggregations
    for calculations independent of the aggregations and fields represented in a chart.
    I started using Tableau right before this feature was released, so I have a very
    strong sense of what was possible and the impact of this improvement. Suddenly,
    deeply complex queries and comparisons could be made within data sets, all in
    the same chart. At the time, I was working as an analyst in healthcare, and I
    remember being amazed at how I could now show zoomed-in data, like the best-performing
    provider, against a state, regional, and national average—all in one chart.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'It was also around this time (2016) that Tableau released version 10\. This
    introduced a modern user interface, a bespoke Tableau font, and the ability to
    relate, both by unions and more importantly by joins, tables across different
    databases. Suddenly, as an analyst, you could more easily enrich data that was
    disparate. Combining information from multiple systems without the prerequisite
    of a data warehouse or single-source repository was now possible (for die-hard
    Tableau users, data blending has been available since 2010, but with extreme limitations).
    Requests I made as an analyst changed from asking IT for constructed data sets
    to asking for direct access to databases. The unbelievable power of accessing
    the raw data was exciting. As an analyst, this access gave me a better understanding
    of the applications used for the business: I could now understand how it was really
    organized and what data was really there. It filled in a lot of gaps of whether
    certain types of analysis were possible.'

- en: 'From this period of time to the end of 2019, Tableau started addressing two
    new problems: data access, storage, and management; and analytics tools beyond
    visualizations and dashboards. This shift was a significant milestone, quietly
    signifying that its visual analytics product was now quite mature and there was
    now space to spread into other areas of enterprise analytics.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the data access, storage, and management front, Tableau introduced Prep Builder
    (its data preparation tool), a new proprietary data storage format (Hyper), and
    eventually a data catalog. All these innovations represented massive improvements
    to the quality of life of an analytics team working with data. Teams were now
    getting legitimate data preparation tools that rivaled SQL in terms of query and
    cleaning capabilities with the intuitive and visual interface Tableau is known
    for. Hyper, the name for Tableau data extracts, allowed underlying data sets to
    be larger, with both more rows and columns. All analytical operations on dashboards
    became faster. Data started to get less aggregated underneath the dashboards,
    allowing for analysis at both the macro (executive) and the micro (data analyst)
    levels, all in the same space and at the same time. It was now easier to point
    to the exact record of data that was contributing to a monthly trend line. The
    data catalog addition helped legitimize Tableau Server as an enterprise-level
    BI platform—marking the change of Tableau from being categorized as a pretty dashboarding
    tool to a more complete BI solution.

- en: Looking back on this now, it is clear to see that these innovations were a precursor
    to AI, but at the time it was a little bit harder to see it that way. The introduction
    of Ask Data introduced a lot of anxiety to data practitioners. Previously, they
    had been able to control and check that any questions an end user asks of a dashboard
    would surface factually accurate answers. But with a language interpretation engine
    spitting out figures to someone less familiar with how to analyze data, it was
    tough to trust.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Explain Data, the statistical figures that surfaced may or may not be interesting,
    and for the creator of data products, that information felt repetitive. For dashboard
    consumers, it felt like Explain Data would, similarly to Ask Data, introduce facts
    (albeit statistically and factually accurate) that might or might not be of significance.
    Both do push the bar of self-service analytics more toward the end user. However,
    they also invited an erosion of trust (with their audiences) that data professionals
    had been building up through highly developed and iterated dashboards.

- en: From the end of 2019 onward was what I call the *Salesforce era*—maybe as a
    nod to Taylor Swift, but more as an explanation of everything that has been the
    focus of Tableau since its acquisition by its parent company, Salesforce, in the
    second half of 2019\. Since then, Salesforce and Tableau have turned their focus
    almost exclusively to the inclusion and integration of Salesforce and Tableau
    technologies and products. On the data analysis side, it meant the inclusion of
    Salesforce’s Einstein, a mostly predictive and scoring analytics technology, allowing
    for more advanced analysis in both Tableau Desktop and Prep Builder. Improvements
    were also made in connecting to Salesforce data sources and embedding Tableau
    visualizations in its customer relationship management (CRM) application. And
    finally, analytics expanded beyond CRM and Tableau Server/Cloud and into Slack,
    the communications platform Salesforce acquired in December of 2020\. The Einstein
    integration and outbound communication to Slack were released in 2021\. Data Stories
    (summarized text insights based on charts) released in 2022\. [Figure P-1](#pr01_figure_1_1732595610174675)
    shows a timeline of these innovations.

    the bar of entry into a data-informed workplace.
