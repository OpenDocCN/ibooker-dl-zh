    written several books on the topic and advised companies on leveraging its transformative
    potential. In that time, one question has emerged as a recurring theme when I
    talk to people: how can I enhance my AI skills?'

    online courses, and YouTube tutorials to get you started. But if you’re looking
    for a structured path, I recommend pursuing a certification. Certifications do
    more than test your knowledge—they validate your expertise. For employers, they’re
    a signal that you not only understand the fundamentals but also are prepared to
    apply them in the real world.

    Fundamentals (AI-900) exam. It doesn’t just skim the surface. It dives into key
    AI domains like machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), natural language processing
    (NLP), computer vision, generative AI, and responsible AI. Of course, there is
    coverage of key solutions from Microsoft Azure.'
