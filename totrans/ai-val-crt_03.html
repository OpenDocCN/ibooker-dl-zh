<h1><span class="label">Chapter 3. </span>Equations for AI Persuasion</h1>

<p>So far in this book, we’ve framed some great ways to approach GenAI, how profound this moment truly is, some things to watch out for, how to become your own fire starter (fancy talk for someone who extracts the most value from AI—an AI Value Creator, if you will), how to get started, a new mindset for solving problems, and more. We’ve given you some technical details, but we think you’ll agree that we kept the nerd talk light and came in heavy on the business side. That was all by design, and this chapter is no different.</p>

<p>Truthfully, this chapter was added at the last second. You were supposed to get a chapter on use cases, and we feel we owe our editorial team a public apology because when we handed them the final draft, they looked like they’d graduated (with honors) from the School of Raised Eyebrows with all the rework they had to do.</p>

<p>So, why the add? We came across a point of view world-famous economic anthropologist Dr. Jason Hickel<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Hickel, Jason" data-type="indexterm" id="id493"/>, whose research focuses on the global political economy, inequality, and ecological economics. He remarked, “Today, nearly every government in the world, rich and poor alike, is focused single-mindedly on gross domestic product (GDP) growth. This is no longer a matter of choice.”</p>

<p>It made us reflect on our first two chapters and realize that while we were giving you compelling reasons to act, what Hickel was getting at is that you don’t have a choice. Think of it like you’re in a choose-your-own-adventure book in which the choices have pretty much been preselected for you if you want to thrive. And to truly understand this, you must appreciate why AI<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="as critical to business growth" data-secondary-sortas="critical to business growth" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_AIartificialintelligenceascriticaltobusinessgrowth36386"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="business considerations" data-secondary="AI as critical to growth" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_businessconsiderationsAIascriticaltogrowth36386"/> is so critical to future growth, our productivity paradox, and the equations we present in this chapter to help you through it.</p>

<h1>Some Things Are Timeless</h1>

<p>Do us a favor. Read this quote and then reflect<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="responsibility and disruption paradox" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_responsibilityanddisruptionparadox3959"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="disruption and responsibility paradox" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_disruptionandresponsibilityparadox3959"/> on it from the perspective of this GenAI moment that we are in:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We live in an age disturbed, confused, bewildered, afraid of its own forces, in search not merely of its road but even of its direction. There are many voices of counsel, but few voices of vision; there is much excitement and feverish activity, but little concert of thoughtful purpose. We are distressed by our ungoverned, undirected energies and do many things, but nothing long. It is our duty to find ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we reflected on this quote, we couldn’t help but notice this AI era has many people “disturbed, confused, [and] bewildered”—truly, we are in a time when society is experiencing some sort of disorientation and fear due the complexities of modern life. This era’s “many voices of council”<em> </em>contrast with “but few voices of vision,”<em> </em>meaning there are lots of opinions but there is not a lot of forward-thinking business leadership (which we hope this book provides). Finally, “feverish activity” might lend itself to the need to find a societal common point of direction in a world where everyone is claiming to be AI and often moving without regard to implementing this shiny new thing, which is surely emphasized with the assignment of a “duty to find ourselves.”</p>

<p>Indeed, this quote is in reference to modern times. Many of you likely feel like you heard something close to it just last week. Can you guess who said it? Was it Arvind Krishna, the CEO of IBM? Perhaps it was Jensen Huang (CEO of NVIDIA) or Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft). No, wait, you’re thinking, it must be from Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI (assuming there’s been no more drama that could pass for the likes of an episode of HBO’s <em>Succession</em> or Showtime’s <em>Billions</em>—he was still the CEO when we wrote this book).</p>

<p>Perhaps the only clue you have to date this quote (outside of this section’s heading) is from its phraseology, which is distinctly early 1900s. So just who said these profound words that so accurately describe today’s AI moment? This quote is attributed to Woodrow Wilson<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Wilson, Woodrow" data-type="indexterm" id="id494"/> in his Princeton University baccalaureate address—in 1907, just a few short years before he would become “Number 28,” the 28th president of the United States.</p>

<p>What compelled Number 28 to say what he said? In 1907, like other parts of the world, the US was experiencing an influx of new job types and new workers entering the workforce as industrial capitalism was on the rise. New businesses were forming, and retail was flourishing with more women entering the workforce. Technology was changing business and jobs, and quite simply, things were chaotic to the citizens of the US. And while lots of things were changing, technology was a force to be reckoned with. All of that came together to create a level of uncertainty and angst as technology was being applied to solve problems it had not solved before. In their own special way, citizens of that era were waking up to realize that every day they had been walking by problems they could solve (or make better) with technology. Indeed, some things are timeless.</p>

<p>Today, we find ourselves at a similar inflection point. Technology is advancing faster than ever, but productivity gains are not (more on that in a bit). And as you’ll find out, the world desperately needs a productivity boost to drive financial success for companies and economic growth for countries. AI is the answer to this productivity problem, but we are faced with this paradox: <em>responsibility and disruption must <span class="keep-together">coexist</span></em>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Tension Has Always Existed with Technology—Always" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch03_tension_has_always_existed_with_technology_always_1740182046765553">
<h2>Tension Has Always Existed with Technology—Always</h2>

<p>We’re confident that the feelings many people have around the AI of today aren’t much different from the feelings many people had a hundred-plus years ago, when Wilson said those quoted words. Go back almost four hundred years before that and take note of how Queen Elizabeth I refused to grant a patent to the inventor of mechanical knitting, fearing it would put knitters out of work. Of course, some time later, mechanical knitting machines helped to spark the first Industrial Revolution, which led to explosive economic growth. Indeed, looking back through history, time and time again, it would seem there has always been some sort of tension that’s existed between society and technology.</p>

<p>The reason why this quote resonated with and felt so current to so many of you is because it likely echoes some of the same things that you (or people you know) feel today about AI. Quite simply, because all this history keeps repeating itself, it is the very reason we’re going to share a paradox that we see occurring with businesses‚ governments, academic institutions, and all parts in between<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_AIartificialintelligenceascriticaltobusinessgrowth36386" data-type="indexterm" id="id495"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_responsibilityanddisruptionparadox3959" data-type="indexterm" id="id496"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_businessconsiderationsAIascriticaltogrowth36386" data-type="indexterm" id="id497"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_disruptionandresponsibilityparadox3959" data-type="indexterm" id="id498"/>.</p>

<h2>No Calculators Needed! Our Three Persuasion Equations</h2>

<p>In this section<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="equations for persuasion" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_equationsforpersuasion32529"/>, we want to share some equations to give you a sense of where we see things going. You won’t need a calculator to figure these out, and you can’t ask a large language model (LLM) for the answer either. (You could, but we think our answer will be better.) But fear not! Our equations are straightforward. They were designed to persuade you to read the rest of this book and continue the investment you’re making in your AI acumen, because if you’re still a skeptic (or have to convince skeptics at the office), you’re going to need to really be able to articulate, from a business perspective, just why you’re going to need AI more than you might realize.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the macrodynamics summarized in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_1_1740182046749935">Figure 3-1</a> to help you get a true sense, economically speaking, of what’s going on in our world today. Then we’ll get into the details of these macrodynamics in the subsections that follow.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Populations are declining" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch03_populations_are_declining_1740182046765680">
<h3>Populations are declining</h3>

<p>This is happening in nearly every country around the world<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="population, in GDP growth equation" data-type="indexterm" id="id499"/>. For example, the population of the US could start declining as soon as this year and is expected to be millions lower by 2100. As it turns out, only about 6 countries worldwide will see population growth in the next 50 years, and from a historical perspective, that’s unusual.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch03.html#id500" id="id500-marker">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Adding to this and related to it, we have a shrinking workforce<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="workforce, shrinking of" data-type="indexterm" id="id501"/>, especially in terms of highly skilled workers. Of course, there’s the Silver Tsunami (our endearing term for an aging workforce cohort that’s barreling toward retirement), which presents major challenges and adjustments to society as a whole: from the fact that it brings retirements and the associated enterprise amnesia (loss of institutional knowledge that only exists in the brains of long-serving employees), to a shrinking replenishment talent pool, to increasing healthcare costs, to even the tsunami’s monopolization of pickleball courts and crowding of early-bird discounted buffet lines. And as you’ll find out, this will have a direct impact on economic growth and society at large.</p>

<h3>Productivity varies around the globe</h3>

<p>Some geographies are amazing in terms of their rate and pace of productivity<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="productivity" data-secondary="variation and changes worldwide" data-type="indexterm" id="id502"/>, but unfortunately, that seems to be more and more uncommon in the world’s current state of affairs. For example, productivity in countries like Indonesia is off the charts, but that can’t be said of many other places. At a minimum, we are seeing inconsistent productivity growth around the world. In fact, according to McKinsey, the US <span class="keep-together">productivity</span> rate is growing at a lackluster 1.4% (a decline from the past).<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch03.html#id503" id="id503-marker">2</a></sup> Canada’s productivity (according to the Bank of Canada) declined 1.8% in 2023 compared to 2019 rates (it’s been pretty much flat since 2019, with a 0.6% increase for 2024). But a McKinsey report hits you with a jaw-dropping stat that’s akin to the moment you found out Santa Claus wasn’t real (hopefully, you’re not finding out in this book): if the US could regain past productivity rates, it could add a whopping $10 trillion to its GDP—that’s about a third of its 2024 economy. As we said, this productivity drop is happening globally, but we’d be remiss if we didn’t point out that this drop is <em>despite</em> the technology boom of the past 15 years!</p>

<p>But what happens if a company increases productivity? It typically means more revenue, more revenue means the company can pay higher wages and bonuses to its workers without having to raise prices, more revenue and people spending more of their money means more revenue for a country’s treasury—and on and on the trickle-down effect goes. Quite simply, everyone benefits from better productivity: workers, business, and governments. But what happens when you grow an economy but productivity decreases? Inflation! In fact, just as many world governments have used monetary policy to get stubborn inflation back down to target ranges, the result of a country’s growing GDP accompanied by decreasing levels of productivity is inflationary. We don’t mean to be all doom and gloom here...but no matter how you look at it (squinting, one eye closed, both wide open, or even shut), most of the world <em>really</em> needs to solve its productivity malaise.</p>

<h3>Debt growth with expense and access headwinds</h3>

<p>As we exited the isolation economy<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="debt, growth of" data-type="indexterm" id="id504"/> (think of those two years we spent in a different normal during the COVID-19 pandemic), the era of near-zero interest rates<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="interest rates and productivity" data-type="indexterm" id="id505"/> and a 15-year span that posted perhaps the lowest interest rates in modern history came to an end. In other words, raising capital to start a new company or expand a business used to be easier. On our journey to interest rate normalcy, debt and capital are still available to sustain growth, but they’re dramatically more difficult to get and more expensive to keep than in previous periods—at least at the time of writing this book.</p>

<h3>Uneven GDP growth</h3>

<p>Indeed, most economies around the world<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GDP growth" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_GDPgrowth34755"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="equations for persuasion" data-secondary="GDP growth" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_equationsforpersuasionGDPgrowth34755"/> that are driving productivity upward are also—by definition—experiencing accelerated GDP growth. What’s happening to those that are not exhibiting productivity enhancements? Sure, some of them are growing their GDP, but their per capita GDP is going down, which means most individuals are not better off than they were the year before.</p>

<p>All of this represents business opportunities our equations are designed to expose.</p>
</div></section>
</div></section>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Equation 1: How to Grow GDP" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch03_equation_1_how_to_grow_gdp_1740182046765931">
<h2>Equation 1: How to Grow GDP</h2>

<p>Equation 1 is an old rule of thumb in macro investing. It pretty much says that any economic growth (what GDP really measures: economic output) comes from three things: population growth, productivity growth, and debt growth.</p>

<ul class="simplelist center">
	<li>
	<p><strong>GDP Growth (↑) = ↑ POPULATION + ↑ PRODUCTIVITY + ↑ DEBT</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, take some time to reflect on where the country you live in sits in this equation today. We talked about population<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="population, in GDP growth equation" data-type="indexterm" id="id506"/> growth, and unless you’re in one of a small handful of countries, the population in the country you live in isn’t growing. <em>This means that population is working against you if you’re trying to grow. </em></p>

<p>What about debt growth? Well, we made the point that while debt is still available, it’s going to be more difficult to get and more expensive to hold (really, it already is). <em>This means that debt and capital are working against you if you’re trying to grow. </em></p>

<p>With this in mind, it follows that the only way almost all businesses and governments will drive sustained growth is with an enormous focus on productivity<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="productivity" data-secondary="in GDP growth equation" data-secondary-sortas="GDP growth equation" data-type="indexterm" id="id507"/>—which is declining too. This is different from any challenge we’ve ever faced around growth in the last hundred-plus years.</p>

<p>The bottom line: population and debt are working against anyone who is trying to increase economic output—and Equation 1 tells us that suddenly, there’s an imperative around productivity that <em>everybody</em> has to be thinking about. In other words, productivity is your answer—and GenAI and agents can help. This is why we’re so excited about AI. Without a doubt, AI<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="as boon to productivity" data-secondary-sortas="boon to productivity" data-type="indexterm" id="id508"/> presents the greatest opportunity as a catalyst for growth through productivity.</p>

<p>This is also what brings us to our paradox. Why? Many people are concerned about the implications of AI. Will it be disruptive<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="responsibility and disruption paradox" data-type="indexterm" id="id509"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="disruption and responsibility paradox" data-type="indexterm" id="id510"/> to jobs? Will it change our work? How do we handle responsibility around AI? Can we trust it? So, what’s our paradox? We’ll be blunt (and put it in bold for further effect) with an added reality check: <strong>responsibility and disruption must coexist</strong>. In this moment, there is no other option.</p>

<p>We want you to read our paradox and reality check again. Now, do it again, and one more time...until you conclude that this is a fact. Are we on the same page? Great! Let’s continue.</p>

<p>Look, we talk to lots of clients and governments around the world, and quite honestly, some of them have us concerned. Some tell us, “We think there’s risk in AI, and therefore, we don’t want to do anything.” We tell them (in a nicer way), “You don’t have a choice.”</p>

<p>Step back for a moment. If you agree that the focus of your organization is growth and that growth is the one thing that’s always brought improvements to the world, then you must deal with our paradox.</p>

<p>What does this mean? <em>It means we have to do AI in the right and responsible way</em> (which is why we included the Dr. Seuss‒sounding title of <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05_live_die_buy_or_try_much_will_be_decided_by_ai_1740182048942635">Chapter 5</a>). But don’t stop there, or you’ll sell yourself short. We don’t just have to do AI the right way. While we’re doing AI the right way, <em>we must accept </em><em>the </em><em>disruption </em><em>that it may (and most likely will) present.</em></p>

<p>So that’s the first equation. Think about the dynamics we just shared with you around growth and what it will require for us to continue to grow in all countries around the world. With populations decreasing and debt access tightening and becoming more expensive, the formula for growth disproportionally rests on productivity<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_GDPgrowth34755" data-type="indexterm" id="id511"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_equationsforpersuasionGDPgrowth34755" data-type="indexterm" id="id512"/>.</p>

<h2>Equation 2: What Makes for AI Success?</h2>

<p>That brings us to Equation 2, which is all about how AI is dependent on the following four elements<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="equations for persuasion" data-secondary="AI success elements" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_equationsforpersuasionAIsuccesselements370113"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="persuasion equations for success" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_AIartificialintelligencepersuasionequationsforsuccess370113"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="models" data-secondary="in persuasion equation" data-secondary-sortas="persuasion equation" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_modelsinpersuasionequation370113"/> (all of which are covered in this book):</p>

<ul class="simplelist center">
	<li><strong>AI SUCCESS = MODELS + DATA + GOVERNANCE + USE CASES</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The first is <em>models</em>, like LLMs—the DNA of the GenAI and agents craze. The next<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data" data-secondary="in persuasion equation" data-secondary-sortas="persuasion equation" data-type="indexterm" id="id513"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="governance" data-secondary="in persuasion equation" data-secondary-sortas="persuasion equation" data-type="indexterm" id="id514"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="use cases" data-secondary="in persuasion equation" data-secondary-sortas="persuasion equation" data-type="indexterm" id="id515"/> is <em>data</em>. If you don’t have data, you don’t have AI, and if you don’t make data a central part of your strategy (meaning you’re being an AI Value Creator), then you aren’t using AI to its full effect (meaning you’re operating as an AI User). <em>Governance </em>is how you operate with confidence as AI becomes core to your business processes, and <em>use cases </em>are how you focus on business value.</p>

<p>Notice how we either dedicated a chapter to these topics or spend time discussing them throughout the book? That said, we will spend a bit of time here talking<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data" data-secondary="importance to AI Value Creator" data-type="indexterm" id="id516"/> about data<em> </em>because we think it’s the <em>most critical</em> element of the success of any AI Value Creator. For all the hype and interest in the market today around GenAI and agents—and for good reason—we believe the <em>only</em> sustainable competitive advantage will come from <em>your</em> data. Why? Because if these huge LLMs (like GPT-4.5, Gemini. DeepSeek, and so on) are all pretty much trained on the same internet data, then most LLMs will commoditize over the “long” (Number 28’s parlance for the long term). This means that we will quickly get to a point where the only AI that is differentiated in value from any other model for your business will be the AI that is further trained, steered, or tuned with your data on your business problems. From an LLM perspective, differentiation will emerge along the lines of capabilities, trustworthiness, safety, transparency of weights and data, agentic properties, and so on. Quite simply, you need to ensure that you appreciate the enormous value that lies in your data (the stuff that’s not on the internet for vendors to troll and train their AI on). You can’t just give this data away (which is why the vendor terms you engage with are critical to <span class="keep-together">understand</span>). This is data about better patient outcomes, those who attrite, fraud, buying more, selling more, or whatever it is <em>your</em> business does, and so on. In fact, we’d go so far as to say that models steered with your company’s data are your mic(rophone) drop response<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Wilson, Woodrow" data-type="indexterm" id="id517"/> to Woodrow Wilson’s <em>“do many things, but nothing long”</em> wake-up call.</p>

<p>Think of it this way. When was the last time you walked by a new house build with your friends, stopped, and said to them dreamily, “Ah, the beauty of all those aggregates and cement in perfect harmony!” But you’ve surely remarked on a finished product with materials that contrast and blend to delight the eye—all framed with some terrific, overpriced landscaping that makes a statement.</p>

<p>When looking “long,” you won’t be bragging about the models you tinkered with during the <em>“do many things moment</em><em>.</em><em>”</em> In fact, we don’t think you’ll be bragging about your promotions, processes, product placements, or any of that. We think you’ll be bragging most about your AI that was enhanced with your data and aligned with your business, values, business vocabulary, and so on.</p>

<p>So that’s the second equation. And while we’ve focused more on data, let’s be clear: <em>you can’t be successful in AI without the four elements in this equation</em>. Thinking back to our paradox, you will certainly need governance because we must accept that there will be inherent risks and then, of course, use cases and models. The secret of AI success is therefore being an AI Value Creator with an AI platform.</p>

<h3>Bake the layer cake: A platform that helps you master the AI success equation</h3>

<p>If you want to use AI for your business<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="platform model of AI" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_platformmodelofAI38155"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="business considerations" data-secondary="business versus consumer AI focus" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_businessconsiderationsbusinessversusconsumerAIfocus38155"/>, we think you need an AI stack that was built for business and that is going to look<em> very </em>different<em> </em>from what you might use for consumer AI. In fact, the kind of stack you select will directly impact the business value you derive from AI. In the “long,” we think there will be three approaches that will help you get value out of AI. Recall that back in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_oh_to_be_an_ai_value_creator_1740182046162988">Chapter 2</a>, we commented on our different points of view around AI and being an AI Value Creator—and while you might use all of these approaches, the <em>platform approach</em> will be the one that not only will provide the most value but is critical to get right <em>if</em> you care about maximizing success.</p>

<p>Think of an AI platform like a layered cake. It’s not a cake you can eat—it’s an architecture that represents a business-focused end-to-end stack for AI. And this cake is key to operationalizing AI and extracting the most you possibly can for your business using AI (the platform approach).</p>

<p>Our cake looks like <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_2_1740182046749971">Figure 3-2</a>.</p>

<h4>The base: Hybrid cloud and AI tools</h4>

<p>This cake’s base layer is about hybrid cloud and AI tools<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hybrid cloud and AI tools, platform model" data-type="indexterm" id="id518"/>—the often overlooked part of the cake upon which everything must sit. The rest of your masterpiece won’t present right if you get this wrong. The hybrid concept starts off with the notion that the entire stack is built on open source technology that can run what you need...anywhere. There used to be a discussion around the concept of an enterprise running on a single cloud and perhaps nothing on premises. But the debate over the hybrid cloud has long been settled, and the number of enterprises with a single cloud strategy has become statistically insignificant.</p>

<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>
<p>One of our reviewers, Linda Snow, wouldn’t take payment for her work on our book. Instead, she asked us to perform this public service announcement: <em>on</em><em> </em><em>premises</em> is the correct substitute for <em>on</em><em> </em><em>prem</em>, so stop using the word <em>premise </em>in this context since it means something entirely different.</p>
</div>

<p>Today’s hybrid cloud architecture is focused less on physical connectivity and more on supporting the portability of workloads across all environments (public cloud, private cloud, and even on premises). Truly, public and private clouds are no longer physical “locations” to connect. For example, many cloud vendors now offer public cloud services<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="public cloud services" data-type="indexterm" id="id519"/> that run in their customers’ on-premises datacenters<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="on-premises datacenters" data-type="indexterm" id="id520"/>. Private clouds<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="private cloud services" data-type="indexterm" id="id521"/>, once run exclusively on premises, are now often hosted in off-premises datacenters, virtual private networks (VPNs), virtual private clouds (VPCs), or dedicated infrastructure rented from third-party providers (who are sometimes public cloud providers). On the productivity<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="infrastructure as code" data-type="indexterm" id="id522"/> theme, <em>infrastructure as code</em><em> </em>(think technologies like Terraform with Ansible) lets staff declaratively provision these environments with consistency whenever they need to by using compute or cloud resources that are located behind or beyond the firewall. This is a big deal for AI, and not only because of the build components. It takes on added importance with the advent of edge computing, which offers opportunities to improve global application performance by moving AI inferencing (running the model) closer to where the data is actually collected. Edge computing<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="edge computing" data-type="indexterm" id="id523"/> is probably the one part of deployment that is rarely talked about for AI, but we’re starting to see a lot of work where inferencing is happening on edge devices. And so, AI, by definition‚ will be hybrid in terms of where it runs and where the data you need to steer it with as an AI Value Creator lives. The takeaway? This is important to appreciate because as AI permeates the core of our business process (AI+), interconnected devices that form the Internet of Everything will demand the ability to apply intelligence to everything.</p>

<h4>Data services need to be at your service</h4>

<p>As we noted<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data services, platform model" data-type="indexterm" id="id524"/> in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_oh_to_be_an_ai_value_creator_1740182046162988">Chapter 2</a>, if you’ve seen any of us speak at a conference, you likely heard us chant the mantra, “You can’t have AI without an IA.” As previously mentioned<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="information architecture (IA)" data-type="indexterm" id="id525"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="IA (information architecture)" data-type="indexterm" id="id526"/>, this means you can’t have artificial intelligence without an information architecture. If you leave this layer of the cake out, don’t count on your cake winning any awards. You might be able to still bake that cake, but your cake will never rise to its full potential.</p>

<p>The data services layer is where you instantiate a <em>d</em><em>ata </em><em>f</em><em>abric</em>, which allows your business to discover, collect, organize, govern, and understand all the data<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data fabric" data-type="indexterm" id="id527"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data as a product" data-type="indexterm" id="id528"/> it needs so that it can do something better or even differently. You’ll come across data consumption and distribution methodologies like <em>d</em><em>ata </em><em>as a p</em><em>roduct</em>, too, plus good old-fashioned databases and other components. You probably know a lot about some of these, but that isn’t an excuse to not focus on them.</p>

<p>The takeaway from this layer is to fully appreciate that if you can’t connect to all your data sources and trust them, you’ll never get the right outcomes with AI. Back to our overmentioned analogy (because it’s critical to appreciate): you can’t get value out of your gym membership if you don’t show up to the gym and train. It’s the same with data.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="The AI and data platform: The heart of the cake" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="ch03_the_ai_and_data_platform_the_heart_of_the_cake_1740182046766257">
<h4>The AI and data platform: The heart of the cake</h4>

<p>This is the flavor you will surely savor—you know, the part where you stick your fingers in the mixing bowl (no doubt, to someone’s disapproval) to get a taste before you bake the whole thing. If you get this wrong, whatever you put on top of it will be for naught, and whatever you put underneath it (a good IA) will end up being a waste of your time and money. Frankly, if you don’t get this one spot-on, good luck trying to become an AI Value Creator.</p>

<p>This layer is the place to govern, build, train, and steer models<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data platform to build, train, steer models" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_dataplatformtobuildtrainsteermodels310575"/>. This layer should give your business the flexibility to mix and match and steer or build different models that are best suited to your specific industry or use case. The platform you choose should be open so you can work with any model on the market, whether it’s open and free or you paid for it.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">This platform will undoubtedly come with several capabilities, but <em>it</em> <em>absolutely needs to have the following three ingredients</em>:<em> </em></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>A way to manage data for your AI models. Modern AI architectures are well served by a data lakehouse<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data lakehouse" data-type="indexterm" id="id529"/>, which brings together the data services layer.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A workbench<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="workbench, data platform" data-type="indexterm" id="id530"/> on which to build AI and one that’s consumable for all so that an ace in this space (someone who really knows what they are doing) will be just as comfortable as the brand-new first-time flop in the shop (a newbie making mistakes) who has zero coding skills and understands that failing fast, forward, and safe is how you grow. This workbench is where all parts in between come together to do all kinds of things on your AI journey, from building and managing agents, to steering and using foundational models, to<em> </em>traditional AI.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A governance<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="governance" data-secondary="framework for data platform" data-type="indexterm" id="id531"/> framework that lets the organization direct, manage, and monitor AI activities for GenAI, agents, and traditional forms like machine learning—no matter which vendor built them. This component is crucial because it helps you understand your models and articulate (to investors, your teams, customers, and especially auditors) how they were built. It alerts you if any of your models start to operate in a way you didn’t intend them to (drifting from ground truth, developing bias, and so on) before a regulatory body does. (Oops!) The bottom line: with the right governance, companies can be assured that their workflows will be compliant with ever-changing government regulations and free of bias. If you have all of this perfected (you don’t; no one does), then <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05_live_die_buy_or_try_much_will_be_decided_by_ai_1740182048942635">Chapter 5</a> will be informative and perhaps even enjoyable; otherwise, it could feel like a roller coaster ride for your stomach and nerves. Don’t sell your company short and just be about governance for compliance’s sake. Enhance your governance strategy to include governance for insights because that will help you accrue dividends from your regulatory governance investments, which will help you more quickly traverse those Acumen Curves we introduced you to in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_ai_to_ai_generative_ai_and_the_netscape_moment_1740182043982974">Chapter 1</a>.<em> </em>Quite simply, this means that when you think about all the things that are part of AI governance (explainability, data intelligence, stewardship, security, and so on), you will be doing all the things you need to really turbocharge your AI initiatives. On the contrary, if all you are trying to do is avoid fines, you won’t be accelerating your AI business like you could, but you’ll be putting in the same effort, perhaps more<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_dataplatformtobuildtrainsteermodels310575" data-type="indexterm" id="id532"/>.</p>

<h4>I’m more than OK with an SDK</h4>

<p>The keys to deploying any AI solution are integration points and support for practitioners and developers alike. This means that your platform, or the one you interact with, needs a software development kit (SDK)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="software development kit (SDK)" data-type="indexterm" id="id533"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="SDK (software development kit)" data-type="indexterm" id="id534"/> and APIs so you can build AI into your own product and systems.</p>

<h4 class="less_space">Agents and assistants empower AI for the many</h4>

<p>We like to think that humans deliver capability and that AI provides the scalability<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="agentic systems" data-secondary="AI role of" data-type="indexterm" id="id535"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="assistants" data-secondary="AI role of" data-type="indexterm" id="id536"/>. (A guy named Vlad Stojanovski told us this, and it stuck.) For this reason, AI agents and assistants are the top layer of our cake—they are all about solving (often specific) repeatable problems. You’ve likely heard of or used many AI assistants, such as Otter.ai, Grammarly, and Microsoft Copilot. IBM also has several watsonx-branded assistants that help you write code, automate customer care, and use digital labor (agents) to automate rote tasks and make workflows frictionless. Platforms like CrewAI and BeeAI Agent Framework (open sourced by IBM) provide all the things developers need to help you build and manage your own agents (in this case, these platforms can work with each other). IBM even ships prebuilt agents for specific industries (like HR) for deployment on their own or within IBM’s digital labor platform, watsonx Orchestrate<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="watsonx Code Assistant" data-secondary="Orchestrate" data-type="indexterm" id="id537"/>.

<h2>Equation 3: Find Your Balance—Navigate the Paradox</h2>

<p>So far, we’ve talked about what will be required<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="equations for persuasion" data-secondary="balance in disruption and responsibility" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_equationsforpersuasionbalanceindisruptionandresponsibility313162"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="leadership" data-secondary="balancing disruption and responsibility" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_leadershipbalancingdisruptionandresponsibility313162"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="disruption and responsibility paradox" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_disruptionandresponsibilityparadox313162"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="responsibility and disruption paradox" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_responsibilityanddisruptionparadox313162"/> for most of the world’s economies and businesses to grow, and the role that AI plays in that growth equation. Now, we’re ready for Equation 3, which is all about how to find the right balance by navigating our paradox. We’re specifically talking about disruption coexisting with responsibility. Companies, governments, CEOs, leaders, and workers should be leading the charge to swing the pendulum to where the majority of organizations are using AI (and approaching it with that AI+ mindset from <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_ai_to_ai_generative_ai_and_the_netscape_moment_1740182043982974">Chapter 1</a>, for that matter). We’ve found a pretty successful formula to help you do just this:</p>

<ul class="simplelist center">
	<li>
	<p><strong>FINDING THE BALANCE = LEADERSHIP + SKILLS + OPEN</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>We truly think (a polite way of saying that if you have any plans to make this work, you’d better get this right) you can use these three fundamental elements to navigate our paradox. As you continue reading this book, you won’t be able to help but notice how these elements also just happen to be at the core of this book. We dedicated a whole chapter to skills, leadership is woven into almost every chapter in this book, and you will hear lots more about open source.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Leadership is stewardship: Guiding with care" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch03_leadership_is_stewardship_guiding_with_care_1740182046766513">
<h3>Leadership is stewardship: Guiding with care</h3>

<p>Leadership<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="stewardship, leadership as" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_stewardshipleadershipas313826"/> comes in many forms, but just where will AI leadership come from? It will come from people just like you, reading this book, who will play significant roles in the companies, academic institutions, and governments of the world and who all need to lean into the idea of navigating our paradox. Honestly, successful leaders will be those who are not scared of the risks, rather, they take the time to understand them and act <em>responsibly</em> around those risks.</p>

<p>You can already see some of these leaders emerging today in companies around the world as they start to differentiate themselves from the rest in terms of financial performance. But as a whole, there is a lack of needed AI leadership happening right now, and it really struck us when we read through last year’s IBM Global AI Adoption Index survey, which noted that one in five companies said they don’t yet plan to use AI across their business! This means too many organizations are doing the status quo. Cited among their concerns were limited AI skills and expertise, too much data complexity, and ethical concerns. And now you know why we put this chapter in the book: because as acclaimed psychotherapist Nathaniel Branden<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Branden, Nathaniel" data-type="indexterm" id="id543"/> said, “The first step toward change is awareness. The second step is acceptance.”<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch03.html#id544" id="id544-marker">3</a></sup> We hope by now that it’s obvious how the status quo just isn’t going to work for business—it’s those rift and cliff bad routes we talked about in the Preface...accept it.</p>

<p>We don’t think it’s too much of an overreach to suggest that the companies that are (responsibly) leaning into AI are set to deliver faster growth and better bottom-line improvements than those that are not. How could they not? If you’re spending 30% of your budget on customer support and your competitors shift two-thirds of that spend left, well.... For example, Klarna<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Klarna" data-type="indexterm" id="id545"/> (the Swedish “buy now, pay later” company) notes that well over half of their customer service chats are handled by AI. That renovation budget (spend money to save money from <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_ai_to_ai_generative_ai_and_the_netscape_moment_1740182043982974">Chapter 1</a>) yields savings that fund innovation. If you’re not doing this, how could you compete with this vendor? From our vantage point (we get a unique overview of business and government affairs), we’re already starting to see the disparity and the beginning of a great divide between companies that are leaning into AI and those that aren’t. Looking ahead, this will not be good for society as a whole.</p>

<p>One of us had a rare chance to hear retired General Colin Powell<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Powell, Colin" data-type="indexterm" id="id546"/> speak on leadership. He was the 65th US Secretary of State under President George W. Bush—arguably, the third highest-ranking position in the US government. He was heard saying his now famous line, “Lead so people will follow...if only out of curiosity.” Indeed, we’ve seen companies follow out of curiosity alone and end up in some trouble. While Powell’s quote has become ubiquitous, what most miss when referencing it is the fact that in his speech, he went on to talk about the fact that people will do this <em>if they trust you</em>. So, when it comes to AI, you must think about how you will showcase trust (using AI responsibly) and which technology providers show up every day as good actors (upstanders) or bad actors (bystanders). We think that matters. So, AI leadership <em>does not</em> mean irresponsibly running forward. Leadership means responsibly moving an organization forward, and you don’t do that on your own. A big part of leadership is mixing wisdom (knowing the right path to take) with action. As the old adage goes, “Have the wisdom to know that tomato is a fruit and the knowledge not to put it in a fruit salad.” (Yes, we know that scientifically, a tomato is a fruit, but from a culinary perspective—upon which this adage is based—we’re going with it being a veggie.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_stewardshipleadershipas313826" data-type="indexterm" id="id547"/>)</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Drills and skills help you master the craft" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch03_drills_and_skills_help_you_master_the_craft_1740182046766577">
<h3>Drills and skills help you master the craft</h3>

<p>Skills<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="skilling" data-secondary="leadership" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_skillingleadership314522"/> is the second element of our equation, and we’d say skills strongly relate to leadership. Every company and institution has to build a completely new set of skills to navigate growth in the next 5 to 10 to 20 years. Leaders have to accept that technology is evolving faster than many can follow, creating a gap between demand and skills. This is why we dedicated all of <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06_skills_that_thrill_1740182050334297">Chapter 6</a> to this subject and even went so far as to pull the star power of Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper into our not-so-shallow (get it?) proof points.</p>

<p>For sure, these skills include core computer science, data science, and machine learning skills. The people who have these skills include folks who are well nuanced in state-of-the-art (if you hear the term <em>SOTA</em>—with a long <em>O</em>—that’s propeller-head lingo for “latest and greatest”) models and techniques and what’s on the horizon, too. But with GenAI and agents, there are base skills that you need the entire company to be educated in: how to responsibly use these technology, what they can do, the dangers that come with them, and a notion of how they work—all of this forms a wider aperture.</p>

<p>And don’t forget curiosity! Look, you’re never going to get your workforce to stop walking by problems that can be solved or made better with technology every day if you don’t know what to look for or if workers don’t take displeasure in some rote process and think, “It doesn’t have to be this way.” If your staff isn’t empowered to make changes, all the skills you may uplift in your organizations may be for naught. After all, there is no sense in having chess pieces if you’re only planning to play a game of checkers.</p>

<p>Make no mistake about it. If you’re a business, a government, or any other kind of entity, your people will need new skills for the organization to grow. Now, stop and think about the variance of working models and ways of working in the marketplace today. Some employees come from the world of rotary phones and typewriters (and may have even been punch card programmers), others started their careers with emoji-filled Slack chats (and wore pajama bottoms while in Zoom meetings), and others you’re about to hire will start their careers with AI agents and assistants from the get-go.</p>

<p>Quite simply, the skills that businesses needed to grow 20 to 50 years ago are <em>not</em> the skills that will be needed to grow in the future. We think <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_table_1_1740182046755707">Table 3-1</a> really fleshes out just how much, from a skills perspective, things have changed and will continue to change.</p>

<p>We think that part of our personal roles (and our roles as IBMers) is to pay it forward and build the curricula and access to technology that are needed to help the world get the most out of Equation 3. For example, Indonesia<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Indonesia" data-type="indexterm" id="id548"/> (a trillion-dollar economy) is very focused on technology, and IBM worked with that nation’s government to put a plan in place to train upwards of 500,000 students on these next-generation technologies. Other big-name and small-name companies are doing the same<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_skillingleadership314522" data-type="indexterm" id="id549"/>. We encourage all to get involved, and that starts with paying close attention to <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06_skills_that_thrill_1740182050334297">Chapter 6</a>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="The different facets of being open" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch03_the_different_facets_of_being_open_1740182046766641">
<h3>The different facets of being open</h3>

<p>Transparency<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="transparency" data-secondary="leadership and being open" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_transparencyleadershipandbeingopen318928"/> should be what all organizations seek when it comes to their AI. Being open in a GenAI world is multifaceted, and it’s a bit different from what we’re used to in the traditional technology space—which is why it’s so critical to finding a balance.</p>

<p>Earlier in this book, we told you that one model will not rule them all. Knowing that helps you appreciate why you need to use an open AI platform. You need to be able to choose your own models to find the right balance. The best models for your business over time will depend on your industry, domain, and use case, plus being steered on domain-specific data. In the “long” for business, we think AI Value Creator models will produce more value outcomes for your business than AI User general-purpose models.</p>

<p>One facet of being open is the transparency and openness of the data used to train the models you’ll put to work for your business. When you start to ask vendors about the data used to train their magical models, some will tell you it’s none of your business; others will give you a list of things they <em>think</em> they trained on; and some will literally show you the provenance of where the data comes from, all the pipeline preprocessing that was done to it, the usage rights, and more. At the time this book was written, there was a very select group of companies that published their data sources and pipelines with full transparency.</p>

<p>To be open, we think you have to start with open data<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="large language models (LLMs)" data-secondary="open data for transparency" data-type="indexterm" id="id550"/>. As we’ve talked about earlier in this book, to get the most out of your AI endeavors, you’re going to take your own proprietary data to steer or adjust the model you start with for your business. That model <em>could be </em>open, but for business, it’s more than likely it should be built on open and infused with proprietary data (your secret sauce), or somewhere in between (like the limited dataset an association works with its members to create for the industry it serves). As you hone in on your GenAI strategy, we think you should make an open LLM with data transparency part of your plan. Why? Being open is a good thing because it makes it much easier to identify sources of bias, hate, aggression (and more), it’s good for sovereignty because all the data sources are easily identifiable, it’s good for explainability, it’s good for legal defensibility, and it’s good for education because it naturally lends itself to collaboration among communities.</p>

<p>The second aspect of being open for AI is open source<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="open source AI" data-secondary="transparency, leadership, and being open" data-type="indexterm" id="id551"/>. Open source communities don’t get the credit they deserve, but they have done more for the world than you can imagine. They are where collaboration and innovation happen, and this is why we introduced you to Hugging Face in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_ai_to_ai_generative_ai_and_the_netscape_moment_1740182043982974">Chapter 1</a>. There are open source models and proprietary models, and you will likely use both. In this context, your platform must be open such that you can mix and match the right models. For example, if an industry generates an LLM that’s tuned for insurance, it might be paid for—but it’s open in that it can be used on a platform, and it’s transparent in the data used to build it. Find the companies that are coalescing around open. Many of them are part<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI Alliance" data-type="indexterm" id="id552"/> of the <a href="https://thealliance.ai">AI <span class="keep-together">Alliance</span></a>—a community of technology creators, developers, and adopters collaborating to advance safe, responsible AI rooted in open innovation.</p>

<p>The AI Alliance was started with a focus on accelerating and disseminating open innovation across the AI technology landscape to improve foundational capabilities, safety, security, and trust in AI. Perhaps more importantly, its goal is to responsibly maximize AI’s benefits for people and society everywhere.</p>

<p>The AI Alliance brings together a critical mass of compute, data, tools, and talent to accelerate open innovation in AI. It seeks to do the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Build and support open technologies across software, models, and tools.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Enable</em> developers and scientists to understand, experiment with, and adopt open technologies.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Advocate</em> for open innovation with organizational and societal leaders, policy and regulatory bodies, and the public.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, we believe that there’s certainly a place for proprietary models<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="proprietary models" data-type="indexterm" id="id553"/>, but there’s an even bigger place for open source models in this AI era. Finally, always remember, the name of a company has nothing to do with being open. When it comes to open source, what’s in a name can be awfully misleading<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_equationsforpersuasion32529" data-type="indexterm" id="id554"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_equationsforpersuasionbalanceindisruptionandresponsibility313162" data-type="indexterm" id="id555"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_leadershipbalancingdisruptionandresponsibility313162" data-type="indexterm" id="id556"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_transparencyleadershipandbeingopen318928" data-type="indexterm" id="id557"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_disruptionandresponsibilityparadox313162" data-type="indexterm" id="id558"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_responsibilityanddisruptionparadox313162" data-type="indexterm" id="id559"/>.</p>

<h1>One Last Piece of Advice: See AI as a Value Generator, <span class="keep-together"><em>Not </em>a Cost Center</span></h1>

<p>We’ve found that many leaders and companies view technology (and cybersecurity for that matter) as a cost<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="value generator versus cost center, AI as" data-type="indexterm" id="id560"/> to be managed—and that’s a problem. You’ve got to do all you can to ensure the companies you work for transform their organizational culture to see technology and cybersecurity as value generators, <em>not as </em>cost centers.</p>

<p>The right mindset is to think about what technology can do to fundamentally change a business. If your company sees GenAI and agents as technology costs to be managed (not just the cost of the technology, but the upskilling, governance, and other costs that go with it), it’s probably going to end up on the wrong side of things. Why do we say this with so much confidence? Consider technology spending as a percentage of global GDP: about 25 years ago, this number was 5%—and today, it’s about 15%. This is not a small number when you consider the world’s total economic <span class="keep-together">output</span>.</p>

<p>Now, we want you to think about whether this ratio is going to be higher or lower in the future. Think about it: we’ve gone from 5% to 15% in just 15 years, and who knows where it ends? We think it’s certainly not out of the realm of possibility that the world could get to 20%, 25%, or even 35% of GDP spending on technology in the future. We’re not fortune tellers, but we’ve seen what happens to companies that resist instead of embracing change and disruption. This is why today you see so many deep technologists becoming part of a company’s C-suite, which you didn’t see as much of just 20 years ago.</p>

<h1>Wrapping Up</h1>

<p>At this point in the book, we hope you’ve developed a strong appreciation for how technology is advancing faster than ever; but even more, we hope you appreciate that productivity gains are not. You’ve likely come to agree with us on the notion that you will need better productivity to drive financial success and economic growth for your company.</p>

<p>Businesses and governments <em>can</em> utilize AI responsibly for growth. Notice that we didn’t end that sentence with a question mark. We don’t think it’s a question—rather, it’s part of our paradox. We’re <em>supremely</em> confident that responsibility and disruption can coexist, and through that, you can manage this disruption and avoid the complacency that comes from trying to maintain the status quo.</p>

<p>And if we haven’t said it enough yet (you’re three chapters into this book, and we’re still saying it), you must make responsible AI part of your culture. Remember: responsible AI is responsible business.</p>

<p>Hopefully, that answers the ubiquitous question we get at almost every fireplace chat (an ironic adjective because collectively, we’ve been to just one that actually had a fireplace): is this AI thing too risky? We took comfort when we stumbled across Number 28’s quote during our “book idea” luncheon where mysteriously, no one spoke up and suggested that perhaps we don’t have the spare cycles to write it (but we’re glad we did). Why? Because it’s clear to us that society isn’t dealing with anything that generations before us haven’t dealt with before. And over time, it’s evident that technology has <em>always</em> been a source of innovation and prosperity for people worldwide. Now that you’re almost done reading this chapter, we think that collectively, we’ve got a quorum on the notions that AI is the answer to our productivity malaise and that responsibility and disruption must coexist.</p>

<p>We think the world’s best days are yet to come if we don’t just allow but <em>strongly</em> encourage responsibly used technology to flourish. AI will unleash productivity that will drive a level of GDP growth that none of us has ever seen! The right trusted AI designed for business does just that. And yes, it may mean the evolution of jobs in the near term, but we’re confident that like in every lift, shift, rift, or cliff technology moment in the past, as upskilling occurs, there will be new jobs (ones you never thought of before), markets, and industries. With the right vision of applying responsible AI for productivity, we can indeed find ourselves again and—at the same time—deliver sustained growth and propensity for many years to come.</p>

<p>Reflect again on Woodrow Wilson’s words: <em>bewildered</em>, <em>confused</em>‚ and <em>feverish</em> <em>activity</em>. If your question is, “Can we navigate this?” then the short answer is, “Yes.” Now, let’s go on to the next chapter and see how you put AI to work.</p>
