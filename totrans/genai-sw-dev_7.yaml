- en: Chatbots have been a staple of digital customer service and automation for over
    a decade. Initially built as simple rule-based programs, traditional chatbots
    followed predefined logic trees to handle repetitive tasks, such as answering
    frequently asked questions, providing automated responses in customer support,
    or collecting user information in structured workflows. These chatbots weren’t
    very powerful compared to today’s LLM-based bots, but they became a very popular
    way to automate high-volume, low-complexity interactions. However, their technical
    implementations struggled with unstructured conversations, ambiguity, or user
    inputs that deviated from expected patterns. The experience usually felt rigid
    and unnatural—people clearly understood they were talking to a machine, and those
    user interactions would frequently end with frustrating statements like, “I don’t
    understand. Please try again.”

    rule-based approach to chatbots seems like a distant memory. Today’s AI-powered
    chatbots no longer rely solely on predefined scripts and rules. Instead, they
    leverage sophisticated natural language processing (NLP), contextual understanding,
    and generative AI to deliver dynamic, humanlike interactions. These advancements

    on. As such, I rate it a 9/10\. I didn’t rate it 10/10 because the end product’s
    behavior significantly resembles the default behavior of the underlying LLM (gpt-4o-mini,
    in this test). In other words, if a user were to upload the same training data
    to ChatGPT and ask these questions, the answers would be very similar. Still,
    the ease of doing all this and publishing the bot with a few clicks is impressive.

    capable chatbot with minimal effort. These chatbots are capable both in terms
    of being trained on specific data, and also in their tone, range of inference,
    and ability to follow the specifics of the desired use case. It should be no surprise
    that thousands of businesses are integrating these capabilities into their products.
    It’s also interesting to observe the massive shift in UI patterns, away from the
    traditional list→search→detail approach and toward chatbot UIs that allow the
    user to “talk with the data” in a less structured way.
  id: totrans-94

- en: It’s worth noting that this shift toward chatbot UIs creates room for hallucinations,
    partial responses, and other well-known quirks of LLM technology. Indeed, my main
    takeaway from writing this chapter is that the outputs from all the tools in this
    test were highly dependent on the underlying LLMs they used—for better and for
    worse. It’s great that, with minimal action, a user can set up an impressive chatbot
    that fetches information, structures it correctly, and draws complex conclusions.
    But the chatbot’s output is still very much subject to the limitations of the
    underlying LLM, such as hallucinations.
