      <h1>Preface</h1>
      <p>Thrilling—the one word we use to describe the possibilities and eventualities that generative AI (GenAI)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="generative AI (GenAI)" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_generativeAIGenAI103114"/> and agents will enable. From the boiler room to the board room, we think GenAI will truly impact every industry. As technologists, this level of excitement comes about only once, maybe every other decade, and this is why more and more, every day, the possibilities of GenAI are being recognized by people all over the world. Indeed, GenAI has the promise of a revolution, but this one will affect the high-status brainwork that the Industrial Revolution never touched.</p>
      <p>As many know, Steve Jobs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Jobs, Steve" data-type="indexterm" id="id271"/> dropped out of college and went on to lead one of the most successful companies in the history of the world. Many know Jobs loved simplistic elegance and the beauty of things (like fonts on which he spent a great deal of time studying), and you can see that in Apple’s products to this very day. Many don’t know he was also fascinated with the efficiency of locomotion. He took particular interest in a study that looked at the least amount of energy a species would use to race one kilometer (0.62 miles). It might surprise you (it surprised us) to note that the winner in this category was a condor! Humans? About one-third down the list. But when humankind got on a bicycle, they blew everyone off the efficiency charts. He concluded that humankind could build tools (computers then, and now GenAI and agents) that can make us better—while other species must adapt (which takes a long time, if they can at all). In 1990, he likened a computer to a bicycle and noted, “What a computer is to me is the most remarkable tool that we have ever come up with. It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.” We’re pretty sure if he was around today, he’d note that if a computer is a bicycle for our minds, then GenAI and agents combine to become the bicycle for your business. And just as people have mastered the art of using Excel to manage their finances, track expenses, and create intricate color-coded charts (often with more complexity than necessary), these technologies are poised to become the standard tool for automating tasks, sparking creative ideas, and making it seem like you’ve worked tirelessly to achieve them.</p>
      <p>While this all sounds promising, remember that <em>AI is not</em> a promise about prosperity, and a better world isn’t guaranteed simply because you use GenAI or agents. Why? It can also have a dark side to it, which you will also learn about in this book.</p>
      <aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="pr01_times_change_technology_changes_1740182053105222">
        <h1>Times Change, Technology Changes Faster</h1>
        <p>Let’s get this out of the way: stuff is going to be out of date by the time you read this book. Today, writing about AI is like giving you stats on the number of images uploaded to the internet every second. We tried our best to keep stuff up-to-date (for example, DeepSeek came out, and we harassed our editor to open the manuscript to make some updates). And for sure, there will be new benchmarks, new papers, new state-of-the-art (SOTA) frontier models, GPUs, other accelerators, and more. We reference in this book how technology years used to be like dog years (1:7) and now they’ve become more like mouse years (1:30). So, bear with us when something new shows up that could be at odds with something in the book. <em>That said</em>, we think you’ll find the main point of this book is to give you a mental model of the things to think about on your GenAI and agentic journeys, the things that deserve your attention, the questions to ask (yourselves and your vendors), and more. We think you’ll agree that what we teach you in this book has a way longer shelf life than what GenAI model is today’s SOTA and tomorrow’s “Wait, people actually used that?” With that in mind, we encourage you to look beyond the stats or a model version and ensure you really absorb the advice that lies within—it comes from a place of success and failure, and a large corpus of real-world experiences and observations of what works and what doesn’t.</p>
        <p>For example, the buzz around DeepSeek<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="DeepSeek" data-type="indexterm" id="id272"/> in early 2025 (shortly before we went to print) thunderously demonstrated the very timeless points we are making in this book. Let us explain. The market mostly assumed that training cutting-edge models requires millions (or hundreds of millions) in investment with the latest, fastest, and greatest chips. That it had to be proprietary, and that trade secrecy was essential. DeepSeek proved otherwise, using the very things we’ve written about or mentioned in this book (Mixture of Experts, distillation, and reinforcement learning, among others) and some clever new optimizations (which we cover in this book too). It was released with a very permissive MIT license<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="MIT license" data-type="indexterm" id="id273"/>—that speaks to the open community we talk about in this book. So, while it may not show up in a benchmark comparison chart in this book, that was never the point because <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="benchmark data" data-type="indexterm" id="id274"/>benchmarks are like a <em>Whac</em><em>-A-Mole</em> game. But you will see the very concepts we lay out in this book go to work in the market and spur on new movements and innovations. And make no mistake about it: new innovations and techniques will arise, but we think those will tuck nicely into the playbook we’re giving you in this book to put it to work.</p>

      <section data-pdf-bookmark="GenAI Is a Lift, Shift, Rift, or Cliff Moment" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="pr01_genai_is_a_lift_shift_rift_or_cliff_moment_1740182053105297">
        <h1>GenAI Is a Lift, Shift, Rift, or Cliff Moment</h1>
        <p>We want you to think back to the first time you heard about GenAI. It’s a phrase that really became part of the public conversation in, maybe, late 2022. We have seen new models, evolved models, and an explosion of open models. In a matter of months, GenAI transformed from an intriguing curiosity into a fundamental force driving business innovation, with a fresh wave of use cases and applications emerging each day.</p>
        <p>There is such rapid growth that we can’t predict exactly where we will all be 10 years from now—or even 10 months from when we finished writing this book. But one thing we’re certain about: you’re going to want to be actively engaged in shaping that journey—and hopefully that’s why you’re reading this book right now. We’re at a moment in time here: one that is moving from a world of processes run by humans supported by technologies to one where processes will be run by technology that are supported by (or assisting) humans. This truly is a lift (good), shift (opportunity), rift (not so good), or cliff (what you’re running toward if you don’t upskill) moment for you as a leader, you as an individual, and for the companies you work for.</p>
        <p>The future of AI is not one amazing model to do everything for everyone (you will hear us tell you time and time again in this book: <em>one model will not rule them all</em>). AI’s future will not just be multimodal<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="multimodel AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id275"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="democratization, AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id276"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="multimodal AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id277"/> (seeing, hearing, writing, and so on); it will also most certainly be <em>multimodel</em> (in the same way cloud became hybrid). AI needs to be democratized—and that can only happen if we collectively leverage the energy and the transparency of open source and open science—this will give everyone a voice in what AI is, what it does, how it’s used, and how it impacts society. It will ensure that the advancements in AI are not driven by the privileged few, but empowered by the many. </p>
        <p>Indeed, the DeepSeek hoopla raises a bigger question: Who will shape the future of AI? Again, we think AI development cannot be controlled by a handful of players, especially when some may not share the same fundamental values, such as protection of enterprise data, privacy, transparency, and more. We can’t let AI leadership slip to those with different values and priorities. That would mean ceding control of a technology that will reshape every industry and every part of society. And this is why we’ll keep saying that innovation and true progress can only come by democratizing AI. We think that 2025 must be the year when generative AI gets unlocked from its confines within a few players; and into 2026, we hope that a broad swath of society won’t just be using AI—many will be building it too.</p>
        <p>As you read this book, you will see why we think a huge part of an enterprise’s GenAI toolkit will be smaller open source models<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="open source AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id278"/>—this is how the future will be built. For too long, AI has been seen as a game of scale—where bigger models meant better outcomes. But the real breakthrough is as much about size as it is about efficiency. In our work at IBM, we’ve seen that fit-for-purpose models<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="fit-for-purpose models" data-type="indexterm" id="id279"/> have already led to up to thirtyfold reductions in AI inference costs, and made training more efficient and AI more accessible. There is no law of physics that dictates AI must remain expensive. The cost of training and inference isn’t fixed—it is an engineering challenge to be solved. Businesses, both incumbents and upstarts, have the ingenuity to push these costs down and make AI more practical and widespread.</p>
        <p>There’s an old Chinese proverb about when is the best time to plant a tree. Whatever that time is (it varies depending on who tells you the story), it’s in the past. But there is no argument about the next best time: today. We want to thank you for taking the initiative to read our book. We’re hoping you’ll be thanking us when you’re done reading it because we’re going to give you a framework so you can start making your GenAI and agentic plans and how you can effectively, safely, and responsibly put AI to work for business<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_generativeAIGenAI103114" data-type="indexterm" id="id280"/>.</p>

          <h1>As You Journey into the Book</h1>
          <p>In this book, we are going to demystify AI—generative AI and agents. We’ll explore a bit on how we got here, how it works, and many of the ways they are poised (and will) transform businesses and societies at unprecedented scale. We often refer to this point in time as a “Netscape moment” (Netscape being the world’s first internet browser) because that’s just how profound of an effect we think this technology will have on us all. </p>
          <p>Before you dive in, here’s a quick summary to give you the highlights. Consider it your cheat sheet—without the guilt and with all the good stuff. Use it as a trailer for the book ahead, or to jump into a section that really catches your attention.</p>
          <dl>

            <dd>
              <p>This is a business moment that rarely comes around; in fact, the last time we saw something this big, it was 1993 when a web browser (called Netscape) freed up the internet from the hands of the privileged few and democratized it for the many. Don’t miss it. Things are going to change in the same way they did with the internet. In this moment, you ultimately won’t compete against AI, but you will be competing against other companies using AI. Think about it. If you’re a company spending 25% of your budget on customer service and another company shifts two-thirds of this same spend to have AI do most of the work...well. GenAI and agents will become a dividing line between which businesses will prosper, and which will struggle to keep pace. But always remember, AI is not magic. A couple of years from now, you will think back to this chapter and literally see which companies were the thrivers, which were the divers, and which ones showed up out of nowhere to become the new arrivers. Which one will <span class="keep-together">you be</span>?</p>

            <dd>
              <p>There are many ways to use AI. Be an AI Value Creator not just an AI User! Start your AI journey with the notion that your data is important and you shouldn’t give it away. You’ll need an AI platform to become an AI Value Creator. AI Value Creators accrue and create much more value than AI Users.</p>

            <dd>
              <p>We give you a productivity paradox. Today there are many factors working against business success (decreasing productivity, declining population rates, and more friction and cost when accessing debt). You have a unique opportunity to put AI to work against these forces, especially with AI-fueled productivity and digital labor.</p>
            </dd>

            <dd>
              <p>This is not about pet projects; this is about use cases that drive real value. When you step back, you start to realize that if you master the horizontal use cases of AI (the patterns and the things they can do, such as see, hear, analyze, and more), you will more masterfully choose the right vertical use cases for your business. Remember, computer vision is computer vision. Writing is writing. After all, to a computer, everything is just a bunch of numbers—even your Taylor Swift Spotify playlist. And don’t forget, ensure you take your company over the Value Tipping Point.</p>

            <dd>
              <p>AI that people trust is AI that people will use. You must decide up front if you are going to be a good actor or a bad actor—you’ve seen both around social media and other innovations. Make this decision up front! Why? The world needs regulation at the speed of right and too often, governments move at the speed of molasses. In the end, governments (and hopefully customers) are going to demand that your AI is both explainable and accountable. Stuff your AI journey backpack with fairness, robustness, explainability, and lineage—it’s the ultimate gear for scaling new heights and taking in some truly breathtaking views. Ensure that these are forethoughts and not afterthoughts because, like we named in the chapter, “Live, die, buy, and try—much will get decided by AI.”</p>

            <dd>
              <p>Because the half-life of technology skills is so short, know this: you will miss out on the amazing potential GenAI and agents can deliver to your business if you don’t constantly upskill the many. Your teams need to know what AI can do, what it can’t do, what to look out for, and more. No, you don’t need everyone to have computer science degrees, but the only way to democratize AI for the many is to upskill the many. After all, how can you stop walking by problems every day that you could solve or make better with technology if you don’t know that they are even fixable (using technology) in the first place?</p>

            <dd>
              <p>Remember, one model won’t rule them all. A carpenter’s tool belt doesn’t have one tool; it has many tools. What’s more, smaller, more nimble models are showcasing incredible results while addressing some major challenges the world is facing with the traditional large language model (LLM) approach used by many today. But in the end, open access to multiple transparent and open models is going to give you the best chance at success.</p>

            <dd>
              <p>The title says it all: leverage your data as a differentiator. This pairs with being an AI Value Creator. When you step back and realize that perhaps 1% (at most) of enterprise data is in the commonplace LLMs you’re likely using today, you realize there is value to be had. Data is like a gym membership; if you don’t use it, you get nothing from it, but you also can’t just give it away.</p>

            <dd>
              <p>A glimpse into the future where generative AI takes its rightful place alongside classical computing and quantum computing as a new building block for applications called <em>generative computing</em>. This implies that the way we use LLMs is going to leverage software development methodologies that will broaden their applicability, safety, scale, performance, and more. We also expect (it’s happening today) our LLMs to reason more, take their time when warranted, and be thoughtful in their responses. This gives rise to a new area of optimization and “magic”—inference time. This change will pull forward new hardware and accelerators, creating a new compute stack, perhaps even a new generative computer.</p>
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>We think—with the help of this book—when you look back at this moment in history, you will be able to do so fondly, as someone who embraced data as a true resource and used GenAI and agents as a utility to create value. Here we are—the start of your journey. Let’s get into it.</p>

          <h1>The Collective Thank-Yous</h1>
          <p>Obviously, we have our personal list of people we need to thank, but a book like this doesn’t come about because a whole bunch of other people didn’t help us out in one way or another too. This is the section for those people—and we hope we get them all.</p>
          <p>We’ll start out with thanking Linda Snow. Linda read every page in this book, several times, asked clarifying and thought-provoking questions, showered us with unforgiving scowls when it came to some grammar issues, and her eye for even the smallest of details (we call her a comma queen), was a huge help to this book. A heartfelt thanks to you, Linda.</p>
          <p>Rebecca Reyes leads skills at IBM, and she designed and cowrote <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06_skills_that_thrill_1740182050334297">Chapter 6</a> with us. She helped flesh out a recipe that you can use to help move your organization’s skills forward. As she’s often heard saying to anyone who will listen, “One of the most important things you can brag about that impacts a business is your organization’s learning culture.” She is an incredible mind, leader, and human being...thanks, Rebecca!</p>
          <p>Maya Murad and Anna Gutowska were a big help and pushed their obsession with AI agents on us from the very start: thank you! And thanks to João (Joe) Moura at CrewAI for some cool use case ideas and code samples.</p>
          <p><a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ch07_where_this_technology_is_headed_one_model_will_not_1740182051667482">Chapter 7</a> got a lot of help from Mikhail Yurochkin (and the rest of the model router team). Thanks for your great work, it was a privilege to showcase it in this chapter. </p>
          <p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_using_your_data_as_a_differentiator_1740182052172518">Chapter 8</a>, thank you to the entire InstructLab team, along with Kim Martineau (IBM Research Comms), Jeremy Eder (Red Hat), and Syeda Ameena Begum (an AI engineer in Bengaluru).</p>
          <p>David Cox was a big part of <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#ch09_generative_computing_a_new_style_of_computing_1740182052619664">Chapter 9</a>—his insights into the future of GenAI and agents are nearly unparalleled—he is a natural-born storyteller. </p>
          <p>Then there’s the marketing team at IBM that works day in and day out communicating the value of the things we do. We thought we’d be remiss if we didn’t call some of them out by name here because some of their work appears in some format (changed in tone and style) within this book. It starts with Sarah Benchaita, Sarah Meron, and Rebecca Neufeld. They are an incredibly talented and insightful bunch, and we are lucky to know them. We’re also really thankful for the fabulous Lindsey Lurie. Others include Jeremy Hodge, Tiffany Page, Sara Felsenstein, and Stephen Mikolajczak (yes, we are lucky to know them too).</p>
          <p>Of course, we have to give a shout out to our O’Reilly team: Sharon Cordesse, Lisa LaRew, Jon Hassell, David Michelson, and our production editor Kristen Brown. Our lead editor, Gary O’Brien, is not just a joy to work with but is even funny in comment review! Thanks also to Carol Keller and Doug McNair, our copyeditors. </p>
          <p>Finally, to Darío Gil, the former Senior Vice President of Research and Development at IBM. Darío started to write this book with us and then felt the call for public service when the 47th President of the United States, Donald Trump, appointed him the Department of Energy’s Office of the Under Secretary for Science and Innovation. It’s a true honor.</p>

           <dd><p>It’s been said that people tend to overestimate the impact of technology in the short term and underestimate its impact in the long term. As I live what is happening in AI, I see an impact on every time horizon. This book is for those who choose to learn and lead. And to those who taught me to learn and lead, which are my parents, Carol and David Thomas.</p></dd>

            <dd><p>I am a habitual liar. I keep telling anyone who will listen that I’m not writing any more books. And then I write a book. There can only be one reason for this—when one teaches, two people learn. And that’s what I try to do. Every day, learn, learn, learn, and then teach, teach, teach. This innate desire comes from my parents, both hardcore educators, and I thank them for not just instilling this “sickness” in me, but for the guiding hand they raised me with to always try to do the right thing. </p>
            <p>I can promise you that no one writes a book without personal sacrifice. But truthfully, it’s selfish for me to write any book because of the toll it takes on my family. So, to my wife Kelly, thanks for always being there. And to Chloë—my kid, who’s now a young woman (but always my kid). Chloë, no matter what you do in this life, always put your best foot forward; after all, you didn’t come this far to just go this far. If you do this, no matter the potholes you hit or mountains you climb, you will always look back with peace in your heart. That’s the thing I wish for you the most as you become an adult (though you’re still on my pocketbook): find inner peace and pride because inside of you is an unimaginable amount of kindness, and I want the world to experience it. I’d also be remiss if I didn’t thank Lisa Baker because she seems to be the only friend who actually has a real interest in what I write and talk about. Seriously, you’re a brilliant mind, and I love and learn from our discussions. Shout out to Ray and the Pita Deli boys where I wrote some of this book. And to Gina Livy of the Livy Method—who inspires so many to just live better; I cherish our reconnection and I can’t wait to see how this book will help you take your business to the next level!</p>
            <p>Finally, to all the people I’ve been surrounded by in my professional life who make me feel like the dumbest guy in the room (folks like Chris Eaton, Ayal Steinburg, Rebecca Reyes, Madison Gooch, Tom Hronis, Chris Hugill, [Dr.] Laura Musat who is always a text message away, and so many others). I love that place. It’s a source of inspiration. It’s why I jumped on this book with my coauthors (and Darío Gil, who helped us get going). You all make me feel dumb. I sit in awe of you. You inspire me to be better. To know more. And while I will never reach my goal if I’m surrounded by people like you, the “journey” and “vistas” along the way are nothing short of f’ing amazing. Thank you for doing this book with me.</p></dd>

            <dd><p>Working as a businessperson in IBM Research can often feel like working among giants. Practically every coworker has a PhD, pictures of past noble laureates line the walls, and just down the hall is a quantum computer that your coworkers didn’t just build, but straight-up invented. To my entire IBM Research community, thank you. Everything I know, and have tried to share in this book, I know because you took the time to share your work with me, to help educate me and fill gaps in my knowledge, and to answer my questions no matter how dumb. I hope this book does your work justice.</p>
            <p>Above and beyond, thank you to my boss of almost five years, David Cox, for providing the leadership and vision defining what the future of Gen AI should look like. For always respecting my voice and opinion, and pushing me to dig in and lead. And most of all, for being a rational voice when the day-to-day gets a bit insane.</p>
            <p>Finally, thank you to my coauthors, especially Paul. Thank you for your support and mentorship, your patience knows no end; none of this would be possible without you. Thank you to my amazing team, Abe, Aliza, Derek, Hui, and Radha. Thank you to Jacob, who deserves more praise than can fit on this page (now that I’ve written my book, it’s your turn!), and to my parents, Karen and David, whose love of learning, writing, and engineering got all of this started.</p></dd></dl>
