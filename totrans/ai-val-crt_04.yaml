    to peg that is like choosing between backstage passes to a Metallica concert or
    having a role in the next *Deadpool* movie—it’s going to be epic either way, but
    you have no idea which one would make your heart pound harder. For now, let’s
    assume that GenAI could unlock upwards of $10 trillion in productivity over the
    few years and up to $20 trillion by the end of the decade (our consensus by aggregating
    all the reports we’ve come across). What part of that is your company going to
    capture? And that’s only the beginning: we believe, as does just about anyone

    A lack of centralized visibility and reliance on manual tracking leads to scattered

    Certificates expire before clients know, which directly impacts dependent applications,

    tools fail because each tool only works with the certificates that they manage,
    and it’s very difficult to track back to certificates as a root cause of outages.
    The impact and scale of expired, outdated, or misconfigured certificates is massive
    and can lead to a lot of outages and risks, resulting in discontinuity of the

    than doing taxes. The truth of the matter is that keeping a well commented and
    structured codebase is hard to do for a multitude of reasons (labor turnover,
    contractors, retirement, stretch assignments—it’s the least important thing in
    the minds of many developers who think of themselves as the Mozarts of code).
    The irony is that the more complex a codebase is, the less documented it seems
    to get. Automating code summarization can free up a developer’s time to focus
    on higher-value tasks, and just like how GenAI could generate the first copy of
    a customer outreach message, so too can it generate initial documentation. Remember,
    this still requires a developer in the loop to verify it, but it shifts-left the
    work of the initial comments and lets coders transfer a lot of that thinking and
    typing time to designing and prototyping new features. What’s more, as you fine-tune
    your LLM, you get consistency and a set of standards around the writing style
    for these comments.

    and you want to know how the `processOrder()` function works and which parts of

    In the whirlwind of sprints that is the Agile development world, developers are

    cycle of code, test, ship...code, test, ship...again and again. And since no one
    will really read their documented code for months at best, it gets deprioritized.
    But good code documentation is a *must-have* for any development team. In fact,
    we think it plays a crucial role in software development. Sure, there is the obvious:
    it helps other developers—who might be part of its chain of custody—to update
    or review it. But it also fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing across teams.
    McKinsey found this to be the biggest area where AI can help—citing benefits in
    the 45% to 50% time reduction range. IBM has found lots of benefits in this space

    feel like they’re playing with a Jenga puzzle—except that pulling the wrong piece
    will tumble the business as opposed to a bunch of wooden blocks. AI is helping
    these clients discover and identify the code, what it does, how it’s connected,

    Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence (ADDI). As illustrated in the
    middle of [Figure 4-2](#ch04_figure_2_1740182047851284), ADDI is an analysis tool
    that helps you visualize applications, data, and jobs on the mainframe. ADDI enables
    architects and developers to discover dependencies in a click, make changes with
    confidence, and keep documentation current and accurate. When you think about
    it, ADDI is like the ultimate yarn-unraveling tool for developers that helps them
    reverse enterprise amnesia. It operates like a curious cat pawing through a ball

    These delegations can range from automating and speeding up simple tasks, helping
    with more complex decision making. For example, a digital accounts payable worker
    may be able to autonomously perform parts of four traditional job roles—customer
    service representative, billing agent, cash applicator, and dispute resolver—to

    capable LLMs, but one area that doesn’t get the attention it deserves is something
    we call the *data dr**o**ught*. Since most of the internet has been compressed
    into a typical LLM, there’s very little data to lead to more breakthrough (remember,
    LLMs love data). Let’s put that aside and talk about a kind of data drought that
    really hits home: assume you’re a credit card company trying to put GenAI to work
    to prevent fraud. You likely have loads of transaction data, but how much fraud
    data do you have? Sure, you have some fraud data. Is 50% of your data fraud data?
    If it were, you’d likely be out of business. What about data that falls under
    the domain of personally identifiable information (PII) or something similar?
    How much easier would it be to steer a model with data that is semantically like
    your data but is made up—that would eliminate all kinds of privacy issues. And
    as Simon & Garfunkel insinuated in their hit “Fakin’ It,” the answer to data drought
    is synthetic data—in other words, fake it until you make it. Synthetic data is
    data that has been created artificially to replace (perhaps because of privacy)
    or supplement (add to, because there’s not enough of it) real-world data. This

    because we often rely on a “spray-and-pray” method to contain pests, pathogens,

    farming equipment smarter and less wasteful. AI-assisted precision spraying helps
    farmers target specific parts of a plant that need treatment for particular threats.
    This approach significantly reduces the reliance on broad-spectrum weed killers
    that destroy everything in their path. The AI pivots “spray-and-pray” to “see-and-spray.”
    Even the composition of the fertilizer or pesticide can be highly customized based
    on the soil composition or threat assessment. In one solution, AI can identify
    26 crop-specific diseases (such as cedar apple rust and other related rust fungi)
    and in just 0.2 seconds, spray a control substance on the threat area with accuracy
    up to a quarter inch. In fact, real AI-powered lettuce bots already help harvest

    AI can help. How about using an LLM to create challenging role-play conversation?
    Students could have a debate with an AI that has taken on the persona of a historical
    figure and “time travel” to debate them. As students, we would have found it interesting
    to talk to a former Canadian prime minister who, in 1863, after throwing up during
    a debate (he was drunk!) remarked, “I get sick sometimes not because of drink
    or any other causes, except that I am forced to listen to the ranting of my honorable
    opponent.” Perhaps not with the historical figure in the example we gave, but
    imagine fronting such an engagement with an AI-generated person in their likeness,
    with voice and all. The point is that educators can use LLMs to engage learners
    and shift the focus to the art of critical thinking as opposed to memorization
    of facts. To put it plainly, the genie’s out of the bottle, and if some educators
    keep marching to the beat of their own drum, they’re likely to fall off the real
    beat and end up shortchanging the very people they’re trying to help. There’s

    reach-out messages, appointment bookings, and notifications to the broader supporting

    in the world) evidence is used to divorce nearly half of Italian adulterers! Gian
    Ettore Gassani from the Italian Association of Matrimonial Lawyers notes, “We’ve
    seen adulterers using this service to maintain three or four relationships, it’s
    like dynamite.” We’re not sure what’s going on in Italy; however, it is evident
    that communication platforms (such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram) and the
    way we communicate (some courts have ruled that thumbs-up emojis can legally bind
    contracts over text) are fundamentally reshaping the scope and definition of evidence.

    day-to-day operations. Put AI to work by cutting a first draft based on last year’s
    disclosure dynamically updated with data, metrics, and journal entries for the
    current year. Obviously, financial disclosure requires tremendous oversight, so
    human-in-the-loop is critical, but this is a great head start. What’s more, over
    time (using techniques like InstructLab, which we cover in [Chapter 8](ch08.html#ch08_using_your_data_as_a_differentiator_1740182052172518)),

    of products by adding layer upon layer of materials. Those layers could be plastic,
    powder sheets, metal, concrete—and one day, human tissue! AM has been put to work
    for aircraft, dental restorations, medical implants, automobiles, and even fashion
    products. Some sort of modeling software (like computer-aided design [CAD]) is
    typically used to feed a sketch into the AM process, which starts adding its layers
    for the build. Earlier in this book we talked about how nonverbal or programming
    domain languages are evolving into LLMs. For example, Georgia Tech built polyBERT,
    an LLM that thinks about the chemical structure of polymers as a chemical language.
    This closely resembles the L’Oréal initiative we talked about in [Chapter 2](ch02.html#ch02_oh_to_be_an_ai_value_creator_1740182046162988),
    but with a language centered around polymers rather than makeup. This LLM can
    infer shapes and properties to predict how they may behave. An LLM to help in
    the design of CAD documents or the discovery of new bonding agents is a great
    manufacturing use case too. Not convinced? Just ask Bryson DeChambeau, who put
    to work his innovative edge with a set of 3D-printed golf clubs for his historic
    2024 US Open golf win. Traditionally, top-tier golfers use forged clubs (white
    hot metal is pressed into shape), but the additive nature of Bryson’s golf clubs
    allowed his team to constantly iterate the design with a speed not available before.

    reasons. First, more entrants into this space alongside shrinking populations
    require more specific characteristics to join a trial; that means the first-to-find/first-to-heal
    race is more competitive than ever. In fact, clinical trial recruitments can take
    up to 10 months for a mid-stage trial—AI has the opportunity to cut that in half.^([22](ch04.html#id677))
    Site selection (and the associated costs) is another factor. Perhaps a trial’s
    biggest challenge is patient recruitment and retention. Big Pharma has difficulty
    identifying, enrolling, and retaining diverse patients. In fact, this phase can
    take up to 30% of a company’s drug development timeline and can delay trials by
    months. What’s more, once subjects enroll in a trial, there’s an increased need
    to catalyze the adoption of new modalities to improve the patient experience and
    retention (another major clinical trial bottleneck that vastly contributes to
    delays). Now think horizontally about all the ways AI could be put to work for
    clinical trials supporting an analytics-driven enrollment strategy, patient-centered
    recruitment and retention strategies, and dynamic and predictive site monitoring.
