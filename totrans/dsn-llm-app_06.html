<h1><span class="label">Part II. </span>Utilizing LLMs</h1>


<p>In this part of the book, we will explore how to harness and adapt pre-trained LLMs to solve various kinds of language tasks that we introduced in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#chapter_llm-introduction">Chapter 1</a>. To make the best use of these chapters, I strongly suggest that you experiment hands-on with all the techniques introduced, as well as run the corresponding tutorials from the accompanying GitHub repo for this book.</p>
