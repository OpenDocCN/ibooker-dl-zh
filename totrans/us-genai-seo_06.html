      <p>If you can <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content SEO" data-seealso="content development process" id="id572"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SEO (search engine optimization)" data-secondary="content SEO" data-seealso="content development process" id="id573"/>work around the limitations, generative AI can bring substantial leverage to your content development efforts. The key is to learn how to include SME reviews at critical points during your content creation process.</p>
      <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p>This philosophy will also serve you well in creating content for ranking in LLM tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Claude.</p>
      </div>
      <p>As a simple example, consider the process of drafting an outline for a new piece of content. Without AI, writing content from scratch is hard. The writer starts with a blank page, and it’s up to them to figure out what the piece should be about, what topics it should cover, and in what order. Even if an experienced SME is involved to help verify accuracy and relevance, there’s a chance that the writer may have overlooked all the topics that should be addressed in the new content.</p>
      <p>With AI, it’s a different story. Think of generative AI as a brainstorming partner for non-SME writers that helps them come up with a broad range of topic ideas. It can surface relevant ideas for a new piece of content that the writer or even an SME may not have thought of. Even if the generative AI tool’s suggestions aren’t a great fit or are outright wrong, an SME should be able to recognize easily which ones are relevant or could be corrected. This will give writers a great start at completing the task in front of them, which offers significant benefits to the throughput of content creation and can improve content quality at the same time.</p>
      <p>In this chapter, we’ll talk about the importance of involving SMEs throughout your content development process. We’ll show you numerous ways to use AI to improve your content creation, including using it to:</p>
      <ul class="two-col left">

          <p>Create a list of trends</p>
        </li>

      <p>This is by no means a complete list of the ways you can use AI to improve your content development process. At the end of the chapter, we’ll address how you can bring it all together to maximize how you leverage AI in helping your writing team create content.</p>

        <h1>Set Reasonable Goals for Impact</h1>
        <p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03_setting_expectations_for_impact_1748358214008343">“Setting Expectations for Impact”</a>, we discussed<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="generative AI" data-secondary="setting ROI expectations for" id="id574"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ROI (return on investment)" data-secondary="setting expectations for" id="id575"/> setting appropriate goals for how much you can expect to gain from your use of generative AI. When you are considering projects designed to cut costs, increase speed (throughput), and improve quality, normally you’ll find that you can achieve only two of these three goals in any one project. This limitation is real, unless you are applying a disruptive new <span class="keep-together">technology.</span></p>
        <p class="widows5">Generative AI <em>is</em> a disruptive technology, so you can potentially target cutting the costs of creating content, increasing throughput, and improving quality all at the same time. But temper your expectations a bit. You shouldn’t set a goal of reducing costs by 50% and increasing throughput by 100%—it’s just not realistic. Consider more modest goals, such as cutting costs by 20%–30%, increasing throughput by 20%–30%, and improving quality by 20%. These more modest goals are more realistic. Keep that in mind as you go through this chapter.</p>

        <h1>The Role of Subject Matter Experts</h1>
        <p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_what_you_need_to_know_about_what_google_wants_1748358209376145">“What You Need to Know About What Google Wants”</a>, we discussed <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SMEs (subject matter experts)" id="sme-ch4"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="subject matter experts (SMEs)" id="subject-matter-expert-ch4"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human involvement in content generation" id="human-involve-ch4"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content generation" data-secondary="human involvement in" id="content-generation-human-ch4"/>the type of content that Google wants to include in its search results. That discussion included these key points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The subject matter expertise of the author</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The author’s level of direct experience with the content</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Whether your site is considered authoritative on the topic</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If users trust your organization and website in your chosen subject area</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Whether your content brings unique new expertise or perspectives on the topic</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>While Google isn’t perfect at detecting these aspects of your content, that is what it strives to do, and it keeps getting better at it. If you fail to address these factors, you run the risk of your content not ranking well and wasting the investment you made.</p>
        <p class="pagebreak-after">We’ve also previously discussed that generative AI can’t address these factors well. Neither can a writer who isn’t an SME. This is important to internalize if you are in charge of putting together or managing a content development team. An SME must have final ownership of all content you create to ensure that the content they are involved with is of very high quality. The SME could be a power user of your product or someone who can write content about your industry from an authoritative perspective—not a writer who cannot verify the accuracy or relevance of material or come up with insightful content.</p>
        <div data-type="tip" class="less_space"><h6>Tip</h6>
          <p>One way to help motivate SMEs is to put their name on the article (as an author or an editor). A byline from an SME also provides an authoritative element and might stimulate more trust from readers.</p>
        </div>
        <p>If you fail to have an SME play a key role in your AI-supported content development process, you risk republishing thoughts and ideas that have been shared by many others before. It won’t stand out. Worse, some of the information in the content may be off topic or inaccurate, or you may fail to include some key points that you should be making. </p>
        <p>For that reason, SMEs are critical to your content development process, and you’ll see many references to them throughout this chapter and the rest of this book as part of your overall AI-supported SEO strategy. The role of a non-SME writer (or simply, a “writer”) is to draft content. Generative AI tools support an SME creating content as well, albeit in a different way. The SME’s role in content generation is to ensure that the content is authoritative and does not have errors, especially errors <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SMEs (subject matter experts)" data-startref="sme-ch4" id="id576"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="subject matter experts (SMEs)" data-startref="subject-matter-expert-ch4" id="id577"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human involvement in content generation" data-startref="human-involve-ch4" id="id578"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content generation" data-secondary="human involvement in" data-startref="content-generation-human-ch4" id="id579"/>by omission. </p>

        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Researching Topics"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_researching_topics_1748358216258750">
          <h2>Researching Topics</h2>
          <p>Coming up<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content development process" data-secondary="topic generation" id="content-dev-topic-generation"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="topic generation" id="topic-generate"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="keyword research" data-secondary="in content development process" data-secondary-sortas="content development process" id="id581"/> with article ideas can be challenging, but this is one of the many ways generative AI can help. Many organizations begin this process by performing keyword research, and this is useful input to the process of coming up with topics for articles on your site. Hopefully, you’re already supplementing your keyword research with ideas generated by your writers and SMEs.</p>
          <p class="widows8">Topic generation is one thing that generative AI tools can do extremely well. They can come up with fresh ideas that neither your keyword research nor your SMEs will surface. This is potentially of huge value to your SEO program. The key insight is that keyword research tools don’t show all the search terms users might use when searching for something. The reason they don’t is simple: they only sample a small percentage of the traffic on the web and miss most of the long-tail search terms that users enter related to your seed term. However, generative AI tools use a different dataset and may make different suggestions than you would see in traditional keyword research tools. This fits nicely into how Google’s algorithms work since Google wants to send traffic to sites that provide the most value to users, and covering long-tail topics is part of what you need to satisfy a large percentage of your visitors. </p>
          <p>Many people believe that addressing <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="long-tail search queries" id="id582"/>long-tail concerns is a waste of time and budget. They may think that the search volume is too low or that the expense of creating such content is too high. But consider the <a href="https://oreil.ly/BRWC_">data from Ahrefs</a> that shows that 95% of all keywords<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Ahrefs" data-secondary="long-tail keywords" id="id583"/> are long tail, representing 35% of all search volume. That’s a lot of opportunity to leave on the table, especially since long-tail keywords tend to be more specific and therefore can have higher conversions than other search queries. </p>
          <p>Another factor to consider is that <a href="https://oreil.ly/oGoa8">data from the Google leak of May 27, 2024</a>, shows that Google monitors user behavior on websites in great detail. We can infer from this that Google considers the total user experience on your site and that SEO isn’t judged on a simple page-by-page basis. In other words, broad coverage of long-tail topics on other pages on your site can help your main pages rank for the head terms they target. </p>
          <p>Therefore, using many approaches to researching topic areas is very important to your overall strategy.</p>
          <p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_1_1748358216245953">Figure 4-1</a> shows a portion of the response from ChatGPT-4o to the prompt “Suggest some article topics related to someone considering a personal loan.” Note that how you write your prompts is critical to the quality of the outputs that you get back from your generative AI tool of choice. We share simple examples of prompts throughout this chapter (and <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05_using_ai_to_assist_with_technical_seo_1748358218128343">Chapter 5</a>), but investing time in crafting great prompts is worthwhile.</p>

          </div></figure>
          <p>Fifteen topics were suggested in the response. You can take this further by requesting more ideas specific to each subtopic. For example, you can try a follow-on query, such as “Can you provide more detailed ideas related to the top five mistakes to avoid when applying for a personal loan?” <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_2_1748358216245991">Figure 4-2</a> shows the start of the response received from ChatGPT-4o to this query.</p>
          <p>You can keep iterating in this manner until you have detailed outlines for subcategories identified in the starting list of topic ideas.

          <p>Another way to enhance this process is to include a list of the existing content you have on the topic in the problem you give to your chosen generative AI tool. Keep in mind that you’re using generative AI tools as brainstorming partners to generate ideas that your writers and SMEs can then run with. The core value to using generative AI is enabling your writers and SMEs to produce content more quickly and cover your topics more <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content development process" data-secondary="topic generation" data-startref="content-dev-topic-generation" id="id584"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="topic generation" data-startref="topic-generate" id="id585"/>deeply.</p>

These can give writers a starting place and reduce the chances that they will forget important subtopics.</p>
          <p>Of course, generative AI is prone to making mistakes. One way to help address this is to ask the AI to create three different outlines for each article. The SME can then merge these into a single outline. Alternatively, you can use a reasoning model such as ChatGPT-4 to review the three outlines and combine them into one draft for you. You can also ask it to explain why it chose to combine the outlines in the way that it did. (Why did it choose the items that it did? Why did it leave some aspect out?)</p>
          <p>Each of the outlines will likely surface some different aspects of the topic, and merging these can help minimize the chances of gaps in the final outline. In addition, your SME can ensure that the AI tool doesn’t introduce overt errors into the outline.</p>

          <p class="pagebreak-after">It’s great to get data that includes search volumes, and you should use it. However, it’s not ideal to consider only one source of information for a title tag, and a perspective that doesn’t include search volumes may open new avenues of thought for you.

That said, we’ve always suspected that CTRs of results are a factor, and the Google leak confirms that Google does closely track users’ click behavior within search results.</p>
          <p class="pagebreak-after">We should also treat meta descriptions as a ranking factor because they are often used by Google as the description of your listing in the search results.

Similarly, if that same page is clicked on 6.1% of the time, your page may be moved up in the search results.</p>

          <p class="pagebreak-after">Note that the expected CTR shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_7_1748358216246089">Figure 4-7</a> is just sample data, and the expected CTR performance likely varies significantly based on the user query. With changes in the market due to the advent of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Claude, and Google’s integration of AIOs into the search results, your CTR will likely be significantly lower. Once Google integrates AI Mode in its search results, these clickthrough rates may decline even further.</p>
          <p>Generating titles that attract user clicks is one of the more intriguing ways that generative AI can help SEO practitioners. The key is to ask the tool to write a meta description that users will find compelling. If you can do this well, it can lead to a higher CTR and even higher rankings.</p>
          <p>As in all the exercises in this chapter, how you craft your prompt is a key component of success. Here is a suggestion for how you might initially structure a prompt to request a meta description:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="tighten-word-spacing-1">Write five new meta descriptions for https://www.meetbos⁠ton.com/​events/festivals-and-annual-events/boston-marathon/history/. <span class="keep-together">The meta</span> <span class="keep-together">description should provide users</span> with a compelling reason to click on the search listing in Google for the search query “history of the Boston Marathon.” The target audience is people potentially interested in traveling to Boston as tourists.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_8_1748358216246108">Figure 4-8</a> shows what happens when you enter that query into Gemini.</p>

          </div></figure>
          <p>These suggestions provide a range of things to consider in optimizing a meta description. When updating the meta descriptions for your website, you may want to do your critical pages one at a time, with unique descriptions. Then for larger-scale projects (for example, if you have one thousand pages you want to update), you may want to generate only one meta description per page. Then perform a human review of them all in bulk before publishing.</p>

This is especially more effective if you provide generative AI with information that you’ve curated and fact-checked yourself. As discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03_getting_started_with_generative_ai_1748358214007893">Chapter 3</a>, letting generative AI create content for you without human review is ill-advised.

          <p>One example would be if you have a retail chain with one hundred locations and want some simple text at the top of every location’s page. Let’s work on three locations at a time to keep things simple. Bear in mind that your generative AI tool can’t access your database directly, so you’ll need to do that programmatically. In our fictitious example, we’ll extract data for three locations and incorporate that data into our sample prompt shown here:</p>

This can be of great value to your writer in coming up with ideas for new articles or for how to enhance existing articles on your site. When generating a list of trends, it’s a good idea to prompt different tools to give you a more comprehensive view. Each tool may cite different trends, so combining the output from multiple tools will provide you with a more inclusive list.</p>

          </div></figure>
          <p>You’ll see that the response includes a fair amount of detail. In total, Gemini provided seven trends, all of which included images and descriptions. In contrast, the response from ChatGPT-4o is shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_19_1748358216246317">Figure 4-19</a>.</p>

          <p>You’ll notice that the response to the prompt is much simpler than Gemini’s response. You can try to get ChatGPT-4o to produce a similar level of detail as Gemini with a revised prompt such as: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Provide a simple list of trends for blockchain technology. Include short descriptions and images for each trend.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>This produced short descriptions for each trend but only one summary image for the overall response. If you want one image per trend, you should further modify your prompt to ChatGPT-4o to request that.</p>
          <p>As always, increasing your chances of getting the results you want requires tuning your prompts and trying different platforms. If one platform is not giving you the response you’re looking for, you can try other platforms to see if they provide better results.

        <h1>Using AI Throughout Content Development</h1>
        <p>So far in <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content development process" data-secondary="steps for AI usage" id="content-dev-steps"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI-generated content" data-secondary="steps in content development process" id="ai-generate-steps"/>this chapter, we’ve discussed many ways that generative AI can assist in the process of creating high-quality content. Now it’s time to bring it all together.</p>
        <p>Let’s consider what an AI-supported process might look like if the task at hand is creating a new piece of content. We’ll start with the steps you might take to decide on an article topic and then conduct research to inform the contents of an article:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Generate topic ideas and suggested titles</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This provides your SME a great start in the process of developing new content. If you’ve already published many related articles on a topic, include a list of the existing article titles as part of the prompt and clarify that you’re looking for new subjects. This can help steer your generative AI tool away from suggesting topics that you’ve already covered. Let’s assume after this step that you decide on a new article topic you want to cover.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>List relevant questions for your selected topic</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This is another prompt that helps you understand what questions users have. It can inform key subtopics that you want to cover in your article.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Draft outlines for your selected topic</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>When you create new content, your first step is probably to draft an outline of what you want to include in your page. Better still, use generative AI to create three outlines, and your SME can take the best from each of them and merge them into one.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Summarize competitive content for your selected topic</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Ask generative AI to summarize the content of competing articles on your selected topic. This is a great way to gather more information for a high-quality outline for your content.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Summarize topical content for your selected topic</dt>
          <dd>
            <p class="pagebreak-after">This is the same concept as competitive content summarization but for pages that compete in the SERPs, which aren’t direct competitors. </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="less_space">Identify key trends</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Building out lists of key trends related to your space can provide more valuable ideas for new content or enhancements to existing content.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Find facts and statistics related to your selected topic</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This is a very effective way to add valuable data to your content. Take some of the most important content on your site and then pull related facts and stats to make it even better.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Generate FAQs for your selected topic</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Having a list of frequently asked questions and their answers on your key pages is a great way to add value to your content. This is one way to address many of the long-tail questions people have.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Once you’ve completed all these steps, your writer will have a rich array of information to consider and leverage when creating the content. You may only want to go through these steps for your most important pages, but for those pages you will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Speed up the process of creating content </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Reduce the overall cost of creating the content by fully enabling your writer up front</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Improve the quality of the resulting content</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For less important pieces of content, you may choose to implement a subset of the steps. For example, perhaps you get generative AI to assist with providing topic ideas, relevant user questions, draft outlines, and FAQs. This is already a lot of information to equip your writer with input for creating a new piece of content.</p>
        <p>After the piece has been written, you can use generative AI to perform further tasks, such as writing draft meta descriptions and title tags.</p>
        <p>For existing content that you want to update, there are also numerous steps you can take. These include some of the steps from the preceding list: generating a list of relevant questions, identifying trends, and researching interesting facts and statistics. You can also add these<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="gap analysis" data-secondary="types of" id="id617"/> two steps:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Competitive gap analysis</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>For<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="competitive gap analysis" id="id618"/> existing content, ask generative AI to summarize the topics covered by competing pages but not by your page. This should provide numerous ideas for how to enhance your existing content.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Topical gap analysis</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This is the same concept<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="topical gap analysis" id="id619"/> as the competitive gap analysis but for pages that compete in the SERPs but aren’t direct competitors.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>For many of these use cases, consider having the model you’re using provide multiple versions of its work, review them, and give you a final recommendation. You may also want to try to mix and match the different models; for example, have ChatGPT-4o generate two versions, optimize its own output, and make recommendations, and then have Claude or Gemini take that as input and optimize it further. In addition to catching more errors, this advanced technique can be especially helpful for things that the models approach differently. For example, ChatGPT is known for being more verbose and lacking tone, unlike Claude, which can be more succinct and sound more human.</p>
        <p>You don’t necessarily need to pursue all the ideas that we discussed in this chapter, but putting many of them into place will help you improve your content quality, reduce costs, and increase throughput. It may take some time for your writers and SMEs to get used to a modified process and to maximize the benefits of incorporating some of these steps into the process. If people are resistant to changing an established process, inform them how the modifications will make their <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content development process" data-secondary="steps for AI usage" data-startref="content-dev-steps" id="id620"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI-generated content" data-secondary="steps in content development process" data-startref="ai-generate-steps" id="id621"/>lives easier. </p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Throughout the chapter, we’ve provided numerous examples of ways you can use generative AI to improve your content development process. These methods offer great potential to save costs, increase throughput, and improve quality all at the same time. The approaches suggested in this chapter are also designed to leverage the strengths of generative AI tools while minimizing the risks associated with asking them to do more than they’re capable of doing. This is why we consistently stress the importance of human review of AI outputs before deploying those outputs.</p>
