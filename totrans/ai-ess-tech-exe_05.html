<h1><span class="label">Chapter 5. </span>Communicate Your Strategy</h1>

<p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>, we talked about identifying your AI <span class="keep-together">strategy—and</span> if you
did your homework, you should have developed your own document that
identifies the challenges, strengths, and guiding policy for your AI
initiatives. With that strategy in hand, the next step is being able to
communicate it effectively.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="The Business on a Page Approach"><div class="sect1" id="id72">
<h1>The Business on a Page Approach</h1>

<p>Over the last 20 years, I’ve found the Business on a Page practice
to be an incredibly useful tool for communicating strategy. This
document distills your entire business strategy into a single page,
forcing clarity and alignment around key priorities. To get started,
create a new document with these five key sections:</p>


<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="1. Big-Picture Vision"><div class="sect2" id="id73">
<h2>1. Big-Picture Vision</h2>
<p>Start by defining your company’s long-term vision. This should go
beyond the day-to-day and describe where you want to be in the
future.</p>
</div></section>


<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="2. Why Your Organization Exists"><div class="sect2" id="id74">
<h2>2. Why Your Organization Exists</h2>
<p>Next, capture the “Why” behind your organization. This should include
the fundamental reason you exist, and the impact you want to make. It
should answer the question “Why do we do what we do?”</p>
</div></section>


<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="3. What Your Organization Does"><div class="sect2" id="id75">
<h2>3. What Your Organization Does</h2>
<p>This section gets more specific about what your organization does,
and the value it provides. Clearly state your unique value proposition
and target market by answering these key questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What problems do you solve for your customers? Who are they?</li>
<li>What are the mechanics of your solutions?</li>
<li>What is your positioning?</li>
</ul>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="4. How Your Organization Will Succeed"><div class="sect2" id="id76">
<h2>4. How Your Organization Will Succeed</h2>
<p>Revisit your strategy document, and distill it to address how your
organization will succeed:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are you different from your competitors?</li>
<li>How do your products enable long-term transformation for your
customers?</li>
<li>How will your products be perceived?</li>
</ul>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="5. Actions"><div class="sect2" id="id77">
<h2>5. Actions</h2>
<p>The final, most important step is where you define the specific
actions you will take for the next 6 to 12 months. These actions
should be clear, specific, and measurable, and should align with your
long-term vision and strategy. They might be things you will do more of,
or less of, or things you will stop doing altogether. No matter what, they
should be aligned with your long-term vision and strategy.</p>
</div></section>

</div></section>


<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Clear Communication is Key"><div class="sect1" id="id78">
<h1>Clear Communication is Key</h1>
<p>The Business on a Page exercise creates clarity and conciseness,
making it an excellent basis for communicating strategy to internal
teams, stakeholders, and customers alike. For example, you might use it
to communicate to employees how AI will affect their roles, or to
investors how AI will drive growth and profitability, or to customers
how AI will enhance their experience with your product.</p>
<p>Remember, communicating strategy isn’t a one-time event. As you
continue to implement and learn, you’ll need to revisit this exercise
and communicate updates as necessary.</p>

<p>With everyone aligned on your AI
strategy, it’s time to mobilize the team into action! We’ll cover this
in the next section.</p>
