- en: This book will introduce you to the fundamentals of machine learning through
    TensorFlow. TensorFlow is Google’s new software library for deep learning that
    makes it straightforward for engineers to design and deploy sophisticated deep
    learning architectures. You will learn how to use TensorFlow to build systems
    capable of detecting objects in images, understanding human text, and predicting
    the properties of potential medicines. Furthermore, you will gain an intuitive
    understanding of TensorFlow’s potential as a system for performing tensor calculus
    and will learn how to use TensorFlow for tasks outside the traditional purview
    of machine learning.

- en: Importantly, *TensorFlow for Deep Learning* is one of the first deep learning
    books written for practitioners. It teaches fundamental concepts through practical
    examples and builds understanding of machine learning foundations from the ground
    up. The target audience for this book is practicing developers, who are comfortable
    with designing software systems, but not necessarily with creating learning systems.
    At times we use some basic linear algebra and calculus, but we will review all
    necessary fundamentals. We also anticipate that our book will prove useful for
    scientists and other professionals who are comfortable with scripting, but not
    necessarily with designing learning algorithms.
