- en: In the first couple of chapters in this book, I explain in some detail why and
    how you should select a quality hosting service for your website. And then, after
    setting up an account with that service, you install a new, empty WordPress site
    on that account. We’ll use that site throughout this book as a practice site.
    You’re free to work on an existing site, of course, but it might be easier to
    work on a practice site now, and then apply what you’ve learned to your real site
    later. Or you can ignore the WordPress examples in the book, and just focus on
    learning how to use AI in general. The choice is yours. But what follows is the
    short version of the process if you want to get things set up more quickly.

    usually the least expensive of the top-three hosting services recommended by WordPress
    itself. During the signup process, you’ll be asked to make up a username/password
    pair. Be sure to write them down on paper. If you need any assistance with the
    setup process, contact DreamHost tech support by googling `dreamhost` `tech` `support`*.*
    (In addition to DreamHost, WordPress also recommends Bluehost and SiteGround.
    Both are quality site hosts.)

    write down on paper the username/password pair that you made up for the site (this
    isn’t the same pair that you made up for your hosting service account). Normally,
    installing a new WordPress site is quite easy to do right after creating your
    hosting account. But again, if you need assistance, all three recommended hosts
    have a great tech support staff.

    site as your audience sees it; the *backend* is where you build and update the
    site behind the scenes.) The backend is also known as your site’s *dashboard.*
    When you set up your hosting account, you choose a unique internet address name
    (URL), such as *mysitename.com*. Getting to the backend is easy: just append */wp-admin*
    to get *mysitename.com/wp-admin*. Type that into a browser’s address field, provide
    the WordPress username/password you wrote down, and you’re in! Now, you can add
    pages to the site, modify the look, and customize how the site behaves.'

    site’s Appearance > Themes screen in your backend (click Themes as shown in figure
    A.1). Then, click the Add New button.

    Sixteen the theme for your practice site, and what you see in that site will resemble
    the figures and instructions throughout the book.

    > General screen. Type `Time` `Tested` `Recipes` `for` `the` `Instant` `Pot` as
    your practice site’s title, and `Comfort` `food` `for` `beginners` as the site’s
    tagline (see figure A.2).

- en: 'Tip Your site title and tagline are really important, so take some time to
    find the perfect words. Eye tracking research has revealed that people commonly
    scan your site’s pages in an F-shaped pattern. In other words, it’s typical, even
    on cellphones, for a visitor to read the site title first (the first horizontal
    line in the F pattern) read the tagline next (the second horizontal line), and
    then scan down the left side of the page (the F’s stem). So, in addition to perfecting
    the title and tagline, you’ll also want to note that people are likely to focus
    more on the first several words on the left side of the page, while scanning down
    vertically. If you’re interested in learning more about this, visit here: [https://mng.bz/KGEn](https://mng.bz/KGEn).'

    Search for the `Classic` `Editor` plugin, and then install and activate it. Also,
    install and activate the Classic Widgets plugin as well. They will switch your
    site’s editor from the default Gutenberg block editor to the traditional WordPress
    editor. Many experts prefer the classic editor for reasons described in chapter
    1\. You can, however, easily switch to Gutenberg any time by just deactivating
    these plugins. The Classic Widgets plugin only affects one screen in your backend,
    the Appearance > Widgets screen. (For each exercise involving WordPress, I provide
    instructions for both the classic editor and Gutenberg.) You’re now set up and
    ready to start chapter 1.'
