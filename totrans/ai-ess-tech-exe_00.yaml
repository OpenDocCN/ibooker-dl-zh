- en: There’s a significant disconnect between the people building AI products and
    the executives making decisions about them, leading to misguided strategies and
    wasted resources. For nonpractitioners, navigating the AI space is overwhelming.
    There’s a sea of advice on how to create effective AI products, but much of it
    comes from sources that aren’t hands-on with the technology.

- en: Without practical experience, it’s challenging to separate fact from fiction
    and make informed decisions. On the flip side, AI practitioners in the trenches
    often struggle to communicate their knowledge in a way that resonates with executives.
    They tend to think and speak in technical terms, which can be off-putting or confusing
    for those without a deep technical background. This is where we come in.
