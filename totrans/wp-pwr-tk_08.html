<p class="body">In spite of occasional predictions of doom, blogging is only slightly less popular than it was in its heyday 20 years ago. True, the rise of social media, such as YouTube and Facebook, is serious competition, but there’s still a big audience for blogs. And unlike some other media, blogs continue to score high as a trusted source of information.</p>
<p class="body">Running a blog can be time-consuming because blogs that allow audience participation require that you <i class="fm-italics">vet</i> (check for appropriateness and quality) every message that comes in. Plus, you have to post replies. Of course, you can set up a one-way blog that only features messages from you. But most visitors appreciate the ability to interact with a site.</p>
<p class="body">Our goal in this chapter is to show you the various ways that AI can assist you in automating the tasks involved in managing a high-quality blog. I can’t give you tips on <i class="fm-italics">how</i> and <i class="fm-italics">what</i> to write—that’s specific to your site’s topic. And I don’t know what your topic might be. But <i class="fm-italics">someone</i> can give you specific tips on how and what to write. You guessed it! Ask AI.</p>
<p class="body">In this chapter, you’ll learn several ways that AI can help you understand how and what to write in your blog. First, we’ll have AI critique one of our blog messages and suggest how to improve it. Second, we’ll ask AI to write catchy blog post titles for us. But before getting into these topics, let’s define what a blog <i class="fm-italics">is.</i></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_3">9.1 Blog defined: An overview</h2>
<p class="body">The term <i class="fm-italics">blog</i> is derived from <i class="fm-italics">web log</i>, and originally it was a kind of journal, a running account of someone’s life or thoughts. Then, it was called <i class="fm-italics">weblog,</i> and finally, just <i class="fm-italics">blog</i>.<a id="marker-231"/><a id="idIndexMarker001"/></p>
<p class="body">A blog (there’s usually just one blog page in a site) is unlike other web pages in three ways: expected to be frequently updated; can optionally publish messages from the site’s audience; and is a searchable archive of previous blog messages. However, if you fail to post new content in your blog regularly and often, your visitors are likely to stop coming. And search engines can downgrade you because you’re not providing fresh content.</p>
<p class="body">Blogs are often valued because they allow the audience to interact with the site’s owner. (Be sure to respond promptly to incoming messages if you want to maintain a successful blog.) A blog can also serve as a kind of customer service organ for a business, or a place to post announcements for a club or church. In addition, blogs can</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">publish a list of tips.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">list pets available for adoption, items for sale, or similar offerings.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">improve a site’s search engine optimization (its rank in a Google or AI list) if the blog page demonstrates that a hybrid site (the blog page plus additional relatively static pages) is frequently updated and has fresh information.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">make sales announcements or otherwise promote e-commerce.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">humanize a business, providing personal anecdotes or answers to questions.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">build a brand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">How a blog operates depends on your theme, the version of WordPress you’re using, or plugins you install. The traditional blog contains a reverse chronological list of posts. It displays these messages in a single column that can be scrolled. More recent WordPress default themes include an Archives module in the blog page that lists links grouped by month. When a month is clicked, only those messages posted during that month are displayed. Another recent variant is a three-column display of the messages.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_4">9.2 GPT to the rescue: How to write for your blog</h2>
<p class="body">GPT lets you create your own <i class="fm-italics">custom GPTs.</i> You can build specialized GPTs with their own learning (data you give it) and specific skills. Your custom GPT will be powered by GPT itself. But it’s a fine-tuned version, fed data and given guidelines to proficiently perform specific tasks you request. <a id="idIndexMarker002"/><a id="idIndexMarker003"/><a id="idIndexMarker004"/><a id="marker-232"/><a id="idIndexMarker005"/></p>
<p class="body">Custom GPTs are specialists in a particular domain, such as law, or, in our case, blogging. If your needs are generic, you could also search for one that someone else has already built.</p>
<p class="body">For this next example, we’ll use a GPT named Blog Evaluator by Zbigniew Lukasiak. Run GPT, and then in the dashboard on the left, click Explore GPTs. Search for <code class="fm-code-in-text">Blog Evaluator</code><i class="fm-italics">.</i> Click Blog Evaluator to run it.<a id="idIndexMarker006"/></p>
<p class="body">Here we’ll look at how to use Mr. Lukasiak’s custom GPT from the GPT Store, and then in the next section, we’ll create our own custom GPT. A wizard built into GPT will take us step-by-step through the process.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> As of June 2024, there are more than 3 million custom GPTs and 160,000 are available <a id="idTextAnchor003"/>in the GPT Store.

<p class="fm-exercise">Major Claim:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">The advice for using the Instant Pot for pressure cooking effectively is to always add 1 cup of liquid (water, broth, etc.) to the 6-quart Instant Pot to prevent burning and ensure it reaches pressure.

<p class="fm-exercise">Claim: Always adding 1 cup of liquid to the Instant Pot prevents burning and ensures it reaches pressure.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Grade: C-</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Reasoning: The essay states a clear recommendation but does not explore the possibility of this advice being incorrect or less effective in certain situations. It does not consider exceptions or alternative methods, nor does it discuss why this specific quantity of liquid is recommended.</p><!--<p class="fm-exercise-break">  </p>-->
<p class="fm-exercise">Claim: Use a rack to prevent ingredients from boiling in the water.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Grade: C-</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Reasoning: This is a practical suggestion, but the essay doesn’t provide reasoning or evidence to support why using a rack is beneficial, nor does it acknowledge any limitations or alternative approaches.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Overall Grade: C-</p><!--<p class="fm-exercise-break">  </p>-->
<p class="fm-exercise">The text provides straightforward advice but lacks depth in its reasoning. It does not consider potential counterarguments, different scenarios where this advice might not apply, or the reasoning behind why these specific methods are suggested. It neither explicitly claims its advice is the only correct method, nor does it acknowledge the possibility of being incorrect. Therefore, it receives a C- grade as it neither firmly asserts its correctness nor considers its potential fallibility.</p>

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_5">9.3 Creating a custom GPT: AI-generated message titles</h2>
<p class="body">Years ago, editors at <i class="fm-italics">Cosmopolitan</i> magazine started using numbers in their article titles: <i class="fm-italics">22 Ways to Decline an Invite</i>, <i class="fm-italics">7 Books to Read this Summer</i>, and so on. The trend caught on. Consider including numbers like that fairly often in your post titles. The reason? It gives your audience the impression that you’ve <i class="fm-italics">really</i> researched this topic so what you’re saying is <i class="fm-italics">comprehensive.</i> You discovered that there is a total of “22 ways.” No more, no less.<a id="idIndexMarker012"/><a id="idIndexMarker013"/><a id="marker-233"/><a id="idIndexMarker014"/></p>
<p class="body">Also, you want to use punchy, shorter titles, no longer than nine words usually. And the titles should include active, emotive words like <i class="fm-italics">confirmed</i>, <i class="fm-italics">alarming</i>, <i class="fm-italics">staggering</i>, <i class="fm-italics">revealing</i>. Now and then, you should also use some question titles: <i class="fm-italics">Do you know when to plant bulbs?</i> Note that most people submitting messages to your blog won’t title them, so you’re responsible for titles for both your posts and your visitors’ posts.</p>
<p class="body">Avoid tired generic terms like <i class="fm-italics">easy</i> or <i class="fm-italics">quick.</i> Instead, describe how the reader benefits from the post: <i class="fm-italics">Save Money at the Doctor’s Office</i>. And be specific. Instead of <i class="fm-italics">The Best Way to Cook Fish</i>, use <i class="fm-italics">Fry Salmon in an Instant Pot</i>.</p>
<p class="body">What kinds of titles work best will depend to some extent on your site’s focus and audience. So, it’s a good idea to A/B test versions of headlines using analytic techniques described in chapter 12. And, of course, involve your AI GPT title-writer assistant in coming up with strong titles. Let’s see how to do that by creating our own purpose-built custom GPT blog title writer.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_6">9.3.1 Creating your own GPTs: A use case</h3>
<p class="body">To build your own custom GPTs, you follow several steps using GPT’s custom GPT wizard. Tell it how to perform a specialized, particular task. Then, you can reuse this expert assistant anytime. You can give your GPT instructions, feed it data, and describe its skills. <a id="idIndexMarker015"/><a id="idIndexMarker016"/><a id="idIndexMarker017"/><a id="marker-234"/></p>
<p class="body">Let’s try this out by building our own custom GPT that’s an expert at writing catchy, effective blog message titles. It reads the message and then gives us some titles to choose from. Note that to create custom GPTs, you need to have a paid subscription to ChatGPT. (Free plan users can, however, use existing custom GPTs.)</p>
<p class="body">Follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre7">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Go to the GPT home page at <a class="url" href="https://chatgpt.com">https://chatgpt.com</a>. Then, click Explore GPTs on the left sidebar.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Click the Create button top right.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">You’ll now see the GPT Builder screen.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Type this into the empty field: <code class="fm-code-in-text">Make a headline writer who specializes in creating a list of catchy titles for blog posts</code>.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Press Enter to send that message to GPT.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">After considering your request, GPT will suggest a name for this new GPT. You can use the suggestion or edit it.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Then, GPT suggests an icon. Again, accept the icon or suggest changes.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">GPT will now ask you to provide guidance about the kind of content you want. Always remember that AI bots are now capable of understanding instructions of considerable nuance and length. And they’re getting better all the time at accurately grasping the meaning of natural language, even idioms. In other words, the best AIs now immediately understand the different meanings of the word <i class="fm-italics">cool</i> in “this theater is cool inside” versus “that was a cool movie.”</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Type (or paste) the following extensive guidelines into the content guidance field: <code class="fm-code-in-text">The suggested titles should be appropriate to the content of the blog message being titled. Provide five titles. Use no vulgarity or highly technical words. The titles should be no longer than nine words. Years ago editors at Cosmopolitan magazine started using numbers in their article titles: 22 Ways to Decline an Invite, 7 Books to Read this Summer, and so on. The trend caught on. Experts claim it can be a good idea to include numbers like that fairly often in your post titles. The reason? It gives the impression that you've really researched this topic and what you're saying is comprehensive. You have discovered that there is a total of</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">"</code><code class="fm-code-in-text">22 ways."</code></p>
<p class="list"><code class="fm-code-in-text">Also you want to use punchy, shorter titles, no longer than nine words. And include active, emotive words like confirmed, alarming, staggering, revealing. Also, now and then use some question titles: Should you shower daily? Avoid tired generic terms like easy or quick. Instead, describe how the reader benefits from the post: Save Money at the Doctor's Office. And be specific. Instead of The Best Way to Cook Fish use Fry Salmon in an Instant Pot. These blog messages are about recipes for the Instant Pot, so the titles should employ a vocabulary appropriate to cooking or using the Instant Pot or recipes</code>.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Now to specify how you want your GPT to interact with you, type this: <code class="fm-code-in-text">If the blog post you're titling is in some way vague or unclear, please ask for more details</code>.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Then, when asked about what tone or style you’re after, type <code class="fm-code-in-text">The tone should be friendly, conversational, brief, and clear</code>.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">At this point, you can suggest further refinements if you wish. For instance, request additional examples of great titles, or list the titles in the order of the AI’s opinion of their quality, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">When satisfied, type <code class="fm-code-in-text">Yes</code> to be taken to the Playground where you can test your custom GPT. Here’s a sample blog message that you can submit to the GPT to title: <code class="fm-code-in-text">To prepare rice using the Instant Pot, initiate by washing the rice under a chilly stream of water until the water appears clear, this helps to eliminate surplus starch. Following that, place 1 cup of rice and an equal amount of water into the Instant Pot. Secure the lid and adjust the Venting Knob to the Sealing Position, then commence pressure cooking at High Pressure for a duration of 3 minutes</code>.<a id="marker-235"/></p>
<p class="list"><code class="fm-code-in-text">Once the cooking phase concludes, let the Instant Pot naturally depressurize for a span of 10 minutes, afterwards rotate the Venting Knob to discharge any residual pressure. Swiftly lift the lid and aerate the rice using a fork prior to serving. It's crucial to recognize that the proportion of rice to water and the cooking duration could differ slightly based on the variety of rice being cooked. For instance, white rice such as basmati or jasmine ought to be pressure cooked for 5 minutes, conversely, long-grain brown rice might necessitate 10 minutes</code>.</p>

<p class="body-ind">This result is pretty good. GPT read the entire chapter in 2 seconds and provided five more or less usable titles.</p>
<p class="fm-calloute"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> To educate your custom GPT on the nature of your blog’s posts, you can upload the entire blog contents as a database for your custom GPT. Go to the frontend of your site, go to the blog page, press Ctrl-A to select everything, paste it into Notepad, and then save it as a .txt file you can upload to GPT. You might also need to repeatedly select and copy posts if they are organized by month or some other category. You’ll have to provide GPT with information on how to parse this file of posts (how to know when one post ends and the next one begins). Creating parsing instructions for GPT will be explained in section 9.6.3 later in this chapter.</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">The Capabilities section is where you can add additional functionality to your GPT, including Dall-E image generation and web browsing.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Finally, the Actions section allows you to add one or more external APIs to your GPT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">Let’s now take a brief look at a couple of blog features that don’t (necessarily) need to involve AI.<a id="idIndexMarker027"/><a id="idIndexMarker028"/><a id="idIndexMarker029"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_9">9.4 Using categories and tags</h2>
<p class="body">If your theme doesn’t provide a useful search feature, add a search widget in the sidebar, or a plugin. You want to allow your audience to be able to quickly find what they are interested in. Here are two quality plugins: Relevanssi (<a class="url" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/relevanssi/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/relevanssi/</a>) and SearchWP (<a class="url" href="https://searchwp.com/">https://searchwp.com/</a>). Every site should have a search tool on each page.<a id="idIndexMarker030"/><a id="idIndexMarker031"/><a id="marker-238"/><a id="idIndexMarker032"/></p>
<p class="body">In the blog page, however, there’s an alternative to using the search tool—clicking <i class="fm-italics">categories, subcategories,</i> and <i class="fm-italics">tags</i>. Unlike a search field, visitors don’t have to type in anything. Instead, they can just click a category or tag. That redraws the blog, displaying only those messages that were thus categorized or tagged. Note that we’re talking only about the blog page here. Don’t be misled into thinking that these categories have anything to do with the site’s menu of page titles.</p>
<p class="body">As the administrator, you can create categories and tags in the Posts &gt; Categories or Posts &gt; Tags screens. When you’re ready to post a message, you assign categories or tags to each message by hand in the Posts &gt; All Posts &gt; Edit Post screen. You can create new categories and tags in the Edit Post screens as well.</p>
<p class="body">Categories, subcategories, and tags are displayed in your blog page for the visitors to click. And they form a <i class="fm-italics">hierarchy</i>, with Categories being at the top showing a few broad topics. Next comes the set of subcategories. Finally, tags are the most granular, and display the largest set of terms. Think of categories as similar to a book’s table of contents, and tags as an index. For example:<a id="idIndexMarker033"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Categories</i>—Cruise, Flight, Car</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Subcategories</i>—America, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa, Australia</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Tags</i>—Las Vegas, New York, Miami, Paris, London, Rome, Bangkok, Singapore, Tokyo, Rio, Machu Picchu, Buenos Aires, Cape Town, Cairo, Marrakesh, Sydney, Melbourne, Gold Coast</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">You can create a subcategory by clicking the name of a post in the Posts &gt; All Posts screen. Then, in the Edit Post screen, click the name of this subcategory’s parent category to select it in the Categories module on the right. Click Add New Category. Type in the name of the subcategory. Open the dropdown list of parent categories, and then click the name of the category of which this will be a subcategory.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> You could feed your entire blog to a custom GPT that you designed to come up with a set of categories, subcategories, and tags. The GPT would be taught the difference between these three little clouds of links. It should also be told that you want 6 categories, 10 subcategories, and 20 tags. And then instruct it to build these category clouds by counting the frequency in the blog of nouns, verbs, and gerunds (a verb form that actually functions as a noun, like “we also offer dog <i class="fm-italics">grooming</i>”). You would want to reuse this category GPT now and then. Why? As the blog grows larger, the categories and tags should be adjusted to reflect current blog topics.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_10">9.5 Hiding date stamps on blog posts</h2>
<p class="body">Posts are usually date stamped by default. But you might have reasons to remove the dates. Perhaps you don’t want to advertise that your posts are infrequent, or you want to make the messages appear to have continuing relevance. Also, date stamping isn’t of much use in some kinds of blogs—those that display items for sale or those going for a magazine-style presentation, for example.<a id="idIndexMarker034"/><a id="marker-239"/><a id="idIndexMarker035"/></p>
<p class="body">You can suppress the date stamping by using the YellowPencil plugin (refer to chapter 7). It would automatically generate CSS code to hide the dates. You can then add this code to your Appearance &gt; Customize &gt; Additional CSS screen:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">.entry-footer a .entry-date{
display: none;
}</pre>
<p class="body">Note that this selector (<code class="fm-code-in-text">.entry-footer</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">a</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">.entry-date</code> in this example) will likely not be the same words in your site. So you would go to the Edit Post screen for one of your posts, and then click Edit in YellowPencil. When you’re in the YellowPencil editor, click the date stamp in one of the posts to select it. Then, press the E key to open the CSS Editor. The CSS selector words for your date stamp is displayed in the CSS Editor, as shown in figure 9.2.</p>
<p class="body">Or use a plugin that specializes in managing metadata. Information stamped on posts, such as the author’s name, the date, and so on is called <i class="fm-italics">meta information</i>, and it can be eas<a id="idTextAnchor004"/>ily modified by using the popular WP Meta and Date Remover plugin.<a id="idIndexMarker036"/></p>

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_11">9.6 Vetting incoming messages</h2>
<p class="body">Surely you don’t want to just throw open your blog’s door and automatically publish every blog message random people sent to your site. Here are several reasons you need to review (vet) posts before allowing them to become public in your blog. Messages can contain the following:<a id="idIndexMarker037"/><a id="marker-240"/><a id="idIndexMarker038"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Spam</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Vulgarity</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Inaccurate information</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Off-topic content</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Prejudicial, cruel, or other inappropriate comments</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Worse vulgarity</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Copyright violations</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Substandard quality (typos, misspellings, grammatical problems, redundancy, uninteresting content)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">Then there’s spam. It often contains information that’s simply irrelevant to your site’s topic or includes repeated, redundant content. Publishing junk like that will have a negative effect on the score that Google, Perplexity, GPT and other search tools give your site. And, of course, it will discourage people from bothering to keep reading your blog.</p>
<p class="body">So how can you prevent spam or other unwanted messages from appearing in your blog? WordPress says that blog visitors send in around 77 million comments per month to blogs. And if your site becomes popular, you can imagine how much time it could take to personally approve each post yourself.</p>
<p class="body">Some bloggers don’t let the audience participate at all. It’s not <i class="fm-italics">required</i> that you permit incoming posts from your audience. And some site owners just refuse to—it’s simply too much bother to vet them.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_12">9.6.1 Vetting messages by hand</h3>
<p class="body">But given that an interactive blog can be valuable to both you and your audience, you might choose to keep it a two-way street of messaging. Fortunately, WordPress provides several ways to assist you with vetting incoming messages. We’ll look at those options first, and then see how AI can also help.<a id="idIndexMarker039"/><a id="marker-241"/><a id="idIndexMarker040"/></p>
<p class="body">Go to your Settings &gt; Discussion screen, and then scroll down to the Before a Comment Appears section. You can cut down on having to vet messages yourself by selecting the option that automatically publishes messages from visitors that you’ve previously approved. To use this feature, check both options: Manually Approve and Previously Approved.</p>
<p class="body">Below that, you can find another semiautomatic filtering system. Incoming messages that you need to approve are put into the WordPress moderation queue (it’s the Comments option on the main WordPress Dashboard). So, in the Settings &gt; Discussion screen, in the Comment Moderation section, you can either route an incoming comment to the queue, or send it directly to be published in the blog. WordPress makes its decision based on words you list or other elements such as URLs.<a id="idIndexMarker041"/></p>
<p class="body">And below that is a Disallowed Comment Keys field that decides between publishing or just automatically trashing a message. This decision is based on the same criteria as the Comment Moderation field above it. If the message includes the word ****, into the trash can it goes. <a id="idIndexMarker042"/><a id="idIndexMarker043"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Warning</span> If you make any changes to the Settings &gt; Discussion screen, you must scroll <i class="fm-italics">all the way down</i> to the bottom of that screen and click the Save Changes button.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> If you find you need a more robust or flexible system to automatically block incoming spam, consider adding the Akismet plugin. It uses AI to detect spam. This freemium plugin doesn’t require much setup, and it’s in use by 5 million sites. <a id="idIndexMarker044"/></p>
<p class="body"><i class="fm-italics">Forms</i> are the other common entrance for spam (and sometimes inappropriate content). For some sites, it can be valuable to have people fill in a form from which you can harvest your visitors’ email addresses or other information about them. Probably the best way to automate blocking bad or fake form submissions is to install the WPForms plugin. Among other features, it includes anti-spam protection such as captcha—a visitor must solve a puzzle or math problem before a form can be submitted to your site. We’ll revisit forms later in this chapter.<a id="idIndexMarker045"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_13">9.6.2 Using AI to vet incoming messages automatically</h3>
<p class="body">Soon, somebody will create a WordPress plugin that can automatically read incoming posts, judge them, and publish the ones it considers publishable. You won’t need to be involved at all!<a id="idIndexMarker046"/><a id="idIndexMarker047"/></p>
<p class="body">But at least for now, AI can read all the incoming messages, so you don’t have to. You do though have to paste incoming posts into GPT and ask it to list the ones it deems OK to publish. Have GPT read and judge them for you. To test this, follow these steps to get your text ready for GPT:</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   1.  Go to your site’s backend, and in the Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins screen, deactivate the SeedProd plugin (or any other plugin that displays an Under Construction home page). You want to pose as a new visitor to the site and add a couple of posts that need to be vetted by GPT. So we can try this AI vetting system.<a id="marker-242"/><a id="idIndexMarker048"/></p>
<p class="body-dialog">   2.  To avoid cookies, use a different browser than the one that you used to create your WordPress site, and go to the frontend (not the backend <i class="fm-italics">sitename.com/wp-admin</i>, go instead to <i class="fm-italics">sitename.com</i>).</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   3.  In the menu, click the blog page’s name.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   4.  Then, reply to a couple of posts. Make one reply acceptable and one that should be rejected because it’s full of anger or is ungrammatical or something.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   5.  Now, in your usual browser, go to your site’s backend, and you’ll see that there are two new comments pending approval in the dashboard, as shown in figure 9.3.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figuree"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="675" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH09_F03_Mansfield.png" width="323"/></p>
<p class="figurecaptione">Figure 9.3 This icon tells you there are two new comments awaiting approval.</p>
</div>
<p class="body-dialog">   6.  So, click Comments to get to that screen.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   7.  Now, drag your mouse to select the two posts that need to be judged by GPT, as you can see in figure 9.4.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figuree"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="349" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH09_F04_Mansfield.png" width="1029"/></p>
<p class="figurecaptione">Figure 9.4 By selecting and copying any new comments, you can then submit them to GPT for its decisions.</p>
</div>
<p class="body-dialog">   8.  Press Ctrl-C to copy these comments. You might need to paste into Notepad, and then select and copy from there to get rid of hidden codes—you want just plain text.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_14">9.6.3 Parsing and judging posts</h3>
<p class="body">Our job now is to paste the messages at the end of our prompt and tell GPT how to locate the message itself instead of other details such as the author’s URL. In other words, GPT has to parse the messages to extract only the actual message text itself. So, go to GPT, and give it this prompt:<a id="idIndexMarker049"/><a id="marker-243"/><a id="idIndexMarker050"/></p>

<p class="fm-exercise">I run a blog about bass fishing in North Carolina’s Randleman Lake. You are my assistant, and you’re a moral, upright, and kind person, and a good judge of right and wrong, and a good critic of blog messages. You will look at each text message I submit to you, and decide if it is appropriate. Appropriate means it’s about fishing, contains no vulgarity, no swear words, no hate, no controversial content like talking about politics or religious topics, and no poor spelling or grammar. So, after you get a text message I submit to you, read through it, and if it’s appropriate, display the message, and in one sentence, explain why you found it appropriate.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">You will need to parse each message. Here’s how:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">The messages are delimited by IP addresses. In each comment, locate the IP address. Then, move down to the next lines in the comment (until you reach a CRLF).

<p class="body">Once you have GPT’s list of approved posts, you can search for them in your WordPress backend Comments screen and mark them approved for publication in your blog. This entire job can be automated using systems such as Zapier (<a class="url" href="https://zapier.com/apps/wordpress/integrations">https://zapier.com/apps/wordpress/integrations</a>) or using a plugin to fetch and judge incoming posts. And that should be available quite soon I believe. However, in the meantime, this semiautomatic vetting process can be used where you have to copy and paste the posts.<a id="idIndexMarker051"/><a id="idIndexMarker052"/><a id="idIndexMarker053"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Warning</span> We had to provide GPT with a way to locate the start and end of each message. The start is the URL (for example, 192.158.238.209), and we say move down to the next lines following that URL until you come to a CLRF (an empty line with no text). So, if you’re not getting good results, ensure that there is a blank line between each comment. WordPress does insert this blank line so it should survive the selecting, copying, and pasting process when you’re fetching the unreviewed posts from the Comments screen.</p>

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_15">9.7 Using GPT’s custom instructions</h2>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-244"/>GPT’s <i class="fm-italics">custom instructions</i> feature is similar to the custom GPTs feature explored earlier in this chapter. However, custom instructions are simpler and more limited. Essentially, they allow you to save a prompt that you’ll be using frequently, so y<a id="idTextAnchor005"/>ou need not type it in each time, just select the custom instruction. Click your name in the lower-left corner in GPT, and then click Custom Instructions.

<p class="body">If you’re interested in creating a community of visitors around a blog and growing your audience, you’ll want to actively promote the blog.

And, in Facebook and elsewhere, join groups relevant to your content and encourage them to click a link that lets them see what you’re offering.<a id="idIndexMarker061"/><a id="idIndexMarker062"/></p>
<p class="body">You can contact other bloggers with the same topic as yours and link to each other’s blog. Also, post in these other blogs to cross-promote. Consider making videos of your blog posts’ content and uploading them to YouTube. Add media to posts, such as images, videos, charts, and infographics.</p>
<p class="body">Finally, you can improve your blog traffic by using <i class="fm-italics">analytics</i> (various data on visitor behavior recorded by plugins, which will be covered in chapter 12).

<p class="body">It can be quite interesting to follow GPT’s reasoning. However, in the preceding pseudocode, some steps are clearly missing.

<p class="body">But we should be grateful for any insights into AI’s formerly hidden black box logic.</p>
<p class="body">I think the Turing test is clever, but wrong.<a id="idTextAnchor007"/> To test if AI has become intelligent comparable to ours, the Turing test puts a human and an AI behind a curtain. Somebody converses with them both (using printouts, not voice), and if it’s not possible to reliably tell whether they are interacting with the human or with the AI, then the machine passes the test. In other words, the test asks: Can a machine intelligence convincingly imitate our human conversation and thought processes?</p>
<p class="body">With all due respect to the brilliant Alan Turing, I think this is the wrong question to ask. AI is an alien mind. Aliens will think like aliens. An alien will communicate in alien ways, using alien diction, idioms, and phrasing. It might even have a more advanced logic than we do. Just because we could tell the difference between the conversation of the human and the AI, doesn’t mean the AI isn’t in its own way equal to humans, or superior.</p>
<p class="body">For one thing, recall that AI thinks at electric speeds; human thought involves <i class="fm-italics">chemical</i> processes, which are far slower. Plus, AI has a memory far more vast than ours (the entire internet, plus specialized private databases). It’s increasingly learning from multimodal inputs—meaning that it’s seeing all those traffic cameras, listening to podcasts, watching all of YouTube, seeing all human communications in the Apple space, and much other real-world data. And unlike us, AI doesn’t misremember or forget.</p>
<p class="body">In his book <i class="fm-italics">The Singularity is Nearer</i> Ray Kurzweil points out that to pass the Turing test, an AI system would have to pretend to be dumber than it actually is. It would be a giveaway if the AI solved a hard math problem in two seconds. Or if it could answer a difficult question about truck transmission repair and <i class="fm-italics">also</i> a complicated problem in physics.</p>
<p class="body">AI is an intelligent alien mind. It doesn’t think like us. So, determining if it’s sentient or conscious shouldn’t rest on how convincingly it imitates us.</p>
<p class="body">Given AI’s impressive, ongoing gains in mastering and surpassing human abilities in most cognitive tasks, some people get defensive and say: Well, at least we remain superior in emotional intelligence. I would suggest that, in many contexts, the phrase <i class="fm-italics">emotional intelligence</i> is oxymoronic. <a id="idIndexMarker068"/><a id="marker-251"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_20">Summary</h2>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Blogs differ from other website pages. And to create a quality blog, you need to understand those differences.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">AI can assist you in learning how to write effective blog posts. And it can continue to be an excellent editor going forward, so submit your posts to AI for an insightful critique.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">You should consider several rules that experts came up with for how to title your blog posts effectively. Just as magazine cover headlines sell magazines, so too do blog titles sell your blog. Given that few of your visitors will title their messages, that’s your job as well.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">We asked AI to help us create great, catchy blog titles. And in the process, we also learned how to build and modify custom GPTs that can be employed repeatedly as specialists at specific tasks. WordPress categories have nothing to do with your site’s page topics or the menu. Instead, they are a way for your visitors to view a subset of the blog messages. A visitor clicks a category, and the blog page redraws, displaying only posts in that category.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">You might have several reasons to suppress metadata that’s displayed by default after each blog post. For example, you might want to hide date-stamping because it makes no sense if your blog displays items for sale. Who cares what date an item was added to the blog?</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">You have to weed out bad incoming messages before they appear in your blog. You don’t want to expose your audience (or Google) to vulgar, second-rate, off-topic, or otherwise inappropriate posts. Take advantage of plugins and WordPress’s own tools to semiautomate the process of approving messages for publication. That takes some of the burden of vetting off you.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">It should come as no surprise that GPT can help you automate the blog message vetting process. We created a prompt telling GPT how it should vet each blog message, then told it how to locate each individual message, and how to make its judgement. To simplify reusing this prompt, we learned how to make use of GPT’s custom instruction feature.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Blogs, like any online content, need to be promoted if you’re interested in growing an audience. Use social media, cross-promotion, and platforms such as YouTube to market and publicize your site.</p>
