<li class="co-summary-bullet">Understanding website writing style</li>
<li class="co-summary-bullet">Hooking visitors with a great home page</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">This chapter focuses on your site’s text content. And AI can assist you both in the details, such as choosing a good typeface, and in the quality and style of your writing overall. When spell-checkers arrived, we no longer had to be great at spelling. With AI, we no longer have to be great at writing itself!</p>
<p class="body">Later in this chapter, you’ll submit your text to an AI “Hemingway.” I think you’ll be startled at how much this celebrated author’s techniques will improve your writing. I was. This AI will help you make your sentences more clear, powerful, and beautiful.</p>
<p class="body">To start with, you’ll certainly want to find the best typeface and text design. You can select the font size, font family (such as Times Roman), font style (normal or italic), weight (how thick the characters’ lines are, for example, <b class="fm-bold">boldface</b> vs. regular), and other qualities such as letter spacing and line height. The theme you choose provides some defaults, but you should fine-tune it to best suit your topic and audience.</p>
<p class="body">In addition, you need to consider the tone and style of your writing. Most modern sites have an easygoing, conversational style. So if you come from a legal, academic, or otherwise formal-writing background, you’ll learn in this chapter how to relax your writing—how to master a different, more conversational, approach. And AI can help you rewrite your text to make it more casual and more appealing to the average person.</p>
<p class="body">Finally, we’ll explore ways to grab your visitors’ attention by crafting a brilliant, irresistible home page—the page that visitors see first. Studies show that, on average, people make up their mind whether to stay or leave a home page within .05 seconds! So your visitors’ first impression really counts. This is clearly a case of a book being judged by its cover. And AI will prove quite helpful with this too, ensuring that you make a confident, positive first impression.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_3">4.1 Choosing the best typography</h2>
<p class="body">Most people don’t really understand typography, or even think about it. But on some level, it has an effect on them. Choose an attractive, readable typeface and font size for your site’s body text, headlines, and captions. <a id="idIndexMarker001"/><a id="marker-91"/><a id="idIndexMarker002"/></p>
<p class="body">The single most important typographic consideration is <i class="fm-italics">readability</i>. You want to display characters that are large enough to be legible. Font size on screens is usually specified in <i class="fm-italics">pixels</i>. <a id="idIndexMarker003"/><a id="idIndexMarker004"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">DEFINITION</span> The <i class="fm-italics">pixel</i> or <i class="fm-italics">px</i> (picture element) refers to the smallest visual unit, the individual dots on a digital display. But a pixel isn’t a fixed size, like an inch. It’s relative. Pixel size is relative to the size of the screen as a whole. S<a id="idTextAnchor002"/>o, a jumbotron screen in a football stadium would have brick-size pixels, but a tablet’s pixels would likely be too small to be visible to the eye. A pixel is that single point of color you can usually see by getting up very close to a big-screen TV. <a id="idIndexMarker005"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_4">4.1.1 Understanding AI multimodality</h3>
<p class="body">Currently, <i class="fm-italics">multimodality</i> is an active area of AI research. The idea is that a large language model such as GPT should not only learn from text input but also from other modalities, including video, graphics, music, even traffic cameras, or any other source of information. In other words, they should learn from real-world input the way people do (only much faster than we learn, and forgetting nothing, ever).<a id="idIndexMarker006"/><a id="idIndexMarker007"/> The human brain works at roughly several hundred cycles per second. Computers do several billion.</p>
<p class="body">At this time, text-to-image generators such as Midjourney learn by harvesting images from the internet, and they combine that with text (for example, labeling the images by storing the captions they capture). Large language systems such as GPT scrape the internet and other databases for text. However, the goal is for AI systems to learn from all varieties of information.</p>
<p class="body">With the introduction of GPT 4o (“o” for <i class="fm-italics">omni</i>), GPT led the AI pack by including images and video in its learning. But the other AIs are all moving toward multimodality for both their input and output.</p>
<p class="body">A related area of continuing research involves allowing users to submit multimodal prompts to AI systems. In a limited way, current text-to-image systems do permit this. You can upload images to GPT, Google’s Gemini, and Midjourney, in addition to text prompts. Then, AI generates its output based on both the images and the text. The degree to which the output resembles the submitted images can be adjusted on a sliding scale in some systems. Midjourney also permits you to give it images for both character reference (content) and/or style reference.</p>
<p class="body">But what about multimodal <i class="fm-italics">output</i>? What if you want to make this request:</p>

<p class="body">Right now, the only AIs capable of giving you a text description and also displaying related images are GPT, Gemini, and Perplexity (<a class="url" href="https://perplexity.ai">https://perplexity.ai</a>). Others, for example, Claude and Copilot, are working on it. Claude’s current response to that type of prompt is to provide text, with links to images.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_5">4.1.2 Choosing the best font size</h3>
<p class="body">For your site’s body text, the recommended pixel size to view text on a computer monitor is between 16 px and 18 px. (Good themes automatically adjust the type size down when it detects that the site is being viewed on a tablet or cellphone.)<a id="idIndexMarker008"/><a id="idIndexMarker009"/><a id="idIndexMarker010"/><a id="marker-92"/></p>
<p class="body">But if your body text font is thin, you might want to increase the pixel size a bit. Also, studies have shown that if your site includes lengthy sections of text, you should choose 18 px or an even larger size for re<a id="idTextAnchor003"/>adability (<a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/JNKZ">https://mng.bz/JNKZ</a>).</p>
<p class="body">But remember that most websites shouldn’t be heavy with text. When online, most people are like fleas—jumpy, quick to go elsewhere if bored, confused, or puzzled when confronted with piles of gray text.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> To see and modify the size, typeface, and other elements of your site’s typography, go to your site’s ba<a id="idTextAnchor004"/>ckend (the WordPress Dashboard), and click Appearance &gt; Customize &gt; Typography. It might be called something other than typography, such as <i class="fm-italics">typeface</i> or <i class="fm-italics">text</i>. What it’s called and what information is displayed here depends on your theme or on a typography plugin if you installed one.<a id="idIndexMarker011"/><a id="idIndexMarker012"/></p>
<p class="body">You should also select your font size based on two additional factors: line height and typeface. <i class="fm-italics">Line height</i> is the amount of white space between the lines of text. It’s specified as a multiple of the font size, with 1.5 or 2 being the most common value. Make it too small, and the text can become difficult to read; too large, and the text looks disconnected, as if it were intended to be a bulleted list, but the bullets are missing.<a id="idIndexMarker013"/></p>

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_6">4.1.3 Selecting a typeface</h3>
<p class="body">What works well in a wedding planner site (imitations of human handwriting like calligraphic or script fonts) wouldn’t work for a sporting goods store such as Dick’s. And the formal, conservative Times Roman serif typeface would be most appropriate for hospital and bank websites, where reliability and trustworthiness must be conveyed. However, most sites should choose a sans serif typeface (plain, no curlicues, and little variation in line width). Popular sans serif choices are Arial, Verdana, and Helvetica.<a id="idIndexMarker016"/><a id="idIndexMarker017"/><a id="marker-93"/><a id="idIndexMarker018"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> The terms <i class="fm-italics">typeface, font,</i> and <i class="fm-italics">font family</i> are often used interchangeably, but we’ll use <i class="fm-italics">typeface</i> to refer to the overall design of the letters, that is, their shapes (such as Arial or Times Roman), and we’ll use <i class="fm-italics">font</i> when describing qualities of a typeface such as font size or font style. There are hundreds of typefaces to choose from with various characteristics: thick or thin; varied line shapes and thicknesses; minimalistic or ornate; curlicues; blocky; geometric; and even strange, specialized typefaces that feature spiderwebs to look macabre or characters made of dancing legs to suggest clowns.<a id="idIndexMarker019"/><a id="idIndexMarker020"/><a id="idIndexMarker021"/></p>
<p class="body">Some studies have shown, however, that three typefaces are particularly readable on digital screens: Consolas, Cambria, and Verdana. Only one of these is the clear winner though. <a id="idIndexMarker022"/><a id="idIndexMarker023"/><a id="idIndexMarker024"/></p>
<p class="body">Consolas is the typeface often used for programming code. But because readability isn’t the only criterion (Consolas is quite readable), Consolas should be avoided because it’s simply unattractive. Cambria is also readable, but it’s a serif font (curlicues), which some studies say you should avoid for website body text.</p>
<p class="body">The winner, Verdana, was specifically designed for onscreen reading. Created for Microsoft in 1996, it boasts clean, simple lines. It’s quite popular with site designers. The characters are relatively wide and widely spaced. It’s the best choice for many sites.<a id="idIndexMarker025"/></p>
<p class="body">Verdana is subtle. It has <i class="fm-italics">slightly</i> curved, flared line ends and variations in line thickness on some letters (see the lowercase letters in figure 4.1) giving it a somewhat gentler, more relaxed appearance than traditional sans fonts, which are typically severely linear. You can see Verdana in action in figure 4.1.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">Your site’s theme usually specifies a default size, line height, and typeface. But if it doesn’t, browsers have their own defaults, typically a generic sans serif at 16 px for body text.</p>
<p class="body">You can also use CSS code to modify your typeface values (and CSS can actually pretty much customize <i class="fm-italics">any</i> other design features in the site, regardless of the theme defaults). I’ll show you an excellent plugin in chapter 6 that generates CSS code for you automatically. So, you need not learn the CSS language to fine-tune your site’s look.</p>
<p class="body">The final basic consideration when specifying your font qualities is its color, and more precisely, the <i class="fm-italics">shade</i> of the color. Each color ranges from a pastel shade to very dark. It’s the way pink is a light shade of red. They are the same color, but a different level of darkness.<a id="idIndexMarker036"/><a id="marker-95"/></p>
<p class="body">Some poorly designed sites have dark font colors against dark backgrounds, or vice versa—light against light. Obviously, this lack of contrast makes the text hard to read. It’s particularly frustrating for people with poor eyesight. Text should contrast against its background. This generally means text that’s black or dark against a background that’s white or light. The best choice is usually just plain old reliable black and white. And the background shouldn’t <i class="fm-italics">compete</i> with the text—so no wallpaper or vivid images under the text. In matters like backgrounds, subtlety is to be preferred.</p>

<p class="fm-exercise">Cons:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">The typefaces used lack personality - they are safe and generic choices. Using a font with more character could make the brand stand out more.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Body text paragraphs are very long. Breaking these up into shorter paragraphs could aid readability.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Text alignment is justified, which can cause uneven word spacing. Left-aligned text typically reads easier.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Line lengths get very long on wide screens, making it harder to track from line to line.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Overall the typography gets the job done, but has room for improvement.

<p class="fm-exercise">Here are some font suggestions that could inject more personality into the website, while still remaining appropriate for the pet/animal theme:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Raleway - This elegant, tapered sans serif has a bit more flair than Roboto. It’s [sic] curves and exaggerated strokes add a playful touch.<a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker044"/></p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Montserrat - Montserrat has a rounded, bubbly look with inspiration from urban and graffiti styles. It’s casual but energetic vibe could align well with pets.<a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker045"/></p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Playfair Display - A serif, but with bouncy, friendly letterforms. Its contrast and diagonal stresses give it an organic feel fitting for animals.<a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker046"/></p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Libre Baskerville - A warm, sturdy serif with subtle rounded corners. Its heritage styling brings a touch of classicism while feeling dog-eared and well-loved.<a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker047"/></p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Happy Monkey - A display font with a fun, bubbly, monkey-wrench inspired look. May be too playful for body text, but could work nicely for headlines.<a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker048"/></p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Rock Salt - Handwritten, rough edges give this font loads of personality. Communicates the hand-crafted, personal nature of pets and animals.<a class="calibre" id="idIndexMarker049"/></p>

<p class="body">I’d say that the first three suggestions are worth considering. But as we move down the list, they do become increasingly hallucinogenic.

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_11">4.2.1 Setting the tone</h3>
<p class="body">Website content is mostly conversational and informal. Use the tone and diction like you normally do when talking with your friends. If you were upset with my use of <i class="fm-italics">like</i> in the previous sentence, then you need to lighten up a bit when writing for the web. Conversational writing permits some informality in both diction and grammar. (Strict grammarians would insist that <i class="fm-italics">like</i> in the earlier sentence should be replaced by the words <i class="fm-italics">that</i> or <i class="fm-italics">as</i>.)<a id="idIndexMarker063"/><a id="idIndexMarker064"/><a id="idIndexMarker065"/><a id="marker-99"/></p>
<p class="body">So if you have a legal, copy editing, or academic background, or are otherwise inclined to write formal prose—you probably need to aim for the more casual communication typical of many websites. Of course, there are always exceptions. Sites for legal, banking, medical, or education purposes can require a more formally “correct” style. These sites need to convey reliability, authority, and sobriety. A touch of <i class="fm-italics">chilly</i> doesn’t hurt either. But most websites should aim for a casual, friendly, approachable tone.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_12">4.2.2 Transforming a stiff paragraph</h3>
<p class="body">Remember that the first paragraph in your site’s first page is crucial to capturing an audience. You want to welcome them, to make them feel comfortable right from the start. Let’s try writing a stilted, formal introduction as our first paragraph, and then ask GPT to revise it into a warmer, more colloquial version. This book’s recipe practice site’s home page title is “Easy Excellence” so here’s a pompous first paragraph, filled with bloviation:<a id="idIndexMarker066"/><a id="idIndexMarker067"/><a id="idIndexMarker068"/></p>

Therefore, our aim is to facilitate the process of creating a superb and satisfying culinary experience for your family and friends. And note that we have exhaustively tested every recipe. So, you can consider them failure proofed.</p>
<p class="body">Rather stuffy, no? AI can be quite helpful in situations like this. Here’s what it came up with when we asked it to rewrite our paragraph to make it less formal:</p>

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_13">4.2.3 Conjuring a simulacrum</h3>
<p class="body">Recall that we can assign roles for AI to play, like website critic or prize-winning site designer. This also means that we can have it conjure up famous dead people. Let’s ask an AI Hemingway to give us some advice about improving our prose. <a id="idIndexMarker069"/><a id="idIndexMarker070"/><a id="idIndexMarker071"/><a id="marker-100"/></p>
<p class="body">Hemingway’s style is still hugely influential because of its clarity and simplicity. (And the 1935 book <i class="fm-italics">Elements of Style</i> advocates a similarly clean, clear approach to writing. It was published in 1935 and is still taught today.) Hemingway advised the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Create a short punchy first paragraph. Work on it; it’s the hook to catch readers.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Keep your sentences short. When challenged to tell a story in six words, Hemingway wrote: “For sale: baby shoes, never worn.”</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Use positive, instead of negative, phrases. For example, use <i class="fm-italics">easy</i> instead of <i class="fm-italics">not hard</i>. You should use terms that describe the idea, not its opposite.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Revise, and then revise again. “I write one page of masterpiece to ninety-one pages of s***. I try to put the s*** in the wastebasket.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">They say Hemingway rewrote the final page of <i class="fm-italics">A Farewell to Arms</i> 39 times. An interviewer asked him what the problem was. He said, “Getting the words right.” Truman Capote was also famous for his polished, perfect sentences.</p>

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_14">4.2.4 Using the Hemingway app</h3>
<p class="body">Speaking of Hemingway, there’s an app that puts his prose principles into practice. Give Hemingway Editor app a try (<a class="url" href="https://hemingwayapp.com/">https://hemingwayapp.com/</a>). You’ll get a solid analysis of any problems in your writing. This app is an especially helpful advisor if you’re inclined to write too formally, or you have other problems such as overusing adverbs (“ly” words like <i class="fm-italics">hopefully</i> and <i class="fm-italics">really</i>) or relying too much on the passive voice (<i class="fm-italics">The burger was eaten by the dog</i> can be made clearer and more concise if you revise it to use the active voice instead: <i class="fm-italics">The dog ate the burger.</i>)<a id="idIndexMarker072"/><a id="idIndexMarker073"/><a id="marker-102"/><a id="idIndexMarker074"/></p>
<p class="body">Let’s give our too-formal paragraph to the Hemingway Editor app. Figure 4.2 shows what it said. The app particularly doesn’t like adverbs and recommends using fewer than zero.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="761" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH04_F02_Mansfield.png" width="1122"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 4.2 This Hemingway Editor app can be helpful when revising formal writing into a more conversational style.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">To use this app, click the Write button in the top-right corner of its web page. Delete the existing sample text, and then replace it by pasting your text into that field. Click the Edit button to see the resulting critique.</p>
<p class="body">In addition to developing a relaxed style, also remember to chunk your content into fairly brief paragraphs. Avoid massive gray walls of text. Even try to limit the amount of text in the site as a whole—unless you have good reason not to (a large catalog of goods, for instance). And on most pages, display only a few short paragraphs, separating them using white space, media, or layout design.</p>
<p class="body">It’s also important to take advantage of AI assistance. Your most s<a id="idTextAnchor007"/>uccessful competitors are using it. You can find plenty of body text content generators that can give you a good start, including text to revise in your own words and fact-checking.<a id="marker-103"/></p>
<p class="body">Also, run your text through a plagiarism-detection system. For example, when you turn on the Spelling and Grammar checker (F7) in Microsoft Word, you’ll see the Similarity section in the Editor panel. It will flag any plagiarism problems if<a id="idTextAnchor008"/> it finds your text repeated somewhere else on the internet. Or, try Copyleaks (it checks against billions of online sources) or Grammarly (you should be using it anyway because it’s a fine general-purpose, user-friendly, AI-based writing assistant). Several reviewers say undetectable.ai is the best at both discovering plagiarism as well as “humanizing” ai-generated content.</p>
<p class="body">Why worry about plagiarism? You know you don’t do it. Actually, there <i class="fm-italics">is</i> good reason to worry. Using AI while writing introduces two new dangers. You might at some point forget to have AI’s results checked for plagiarism (now and then it does copy whole paragraphs from the internet without revision). Or you could, in the heat of writing, forget to revise some AI content that you copied. And it’s obviously the right thing to do to only publish <i class="fm-italics">your</i> original content, not someone else’s—even if that someone else is a machine.</p>
<p class="body">That said, AI can generate many different kinds of site-related content, including blog messages, product descriptions, home page text, various levels of formality, a list of engaging variations on a headline from which you can choose, first drafts, and brainstorming, to name a few.<a id="idIndexMarker075"/><a id="idIndexMarker076"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> This article on Medium provides some AI resources for website authors: <a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/75EQ">https://mng.bz/75EQ</a>.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_15">4.3 Making a great first impression</h2>
<p class="body">Remember that you must spend time polishing your home page, especially your site’s first paragraph. And <i class="fm-italics">really</i> work hard on the first sentence. Note that Hemingway said the first paragraph of a piece of writing is crucially important. It must capture the reader’s attention at once.<a id="marker-104"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_16">4.3.1 Hooking visitors</h3>
<p class="body">Indeed, the entire first page of your site has to hook your visitors. Write as many revisions as necessary until the text is brilliant. Make it brief, brilliant, and clear as a country stream. And redesign the page until it’s excellent visually as well.<a id="idIndexMarker077"/><a id="idIndexMarker078"/></p>
<p class="body">We’ll devote two upcoming chapters to site design, but let’s preview the topic now. One way to start thinking about your home page’s design is to consider what would be a good color scheme based on color psychology findings. What colors are best for your particular site’s audience? For our recipe practice site, I researched a bit and came up with the following recommendations:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Red is the color most used by fast-food chains, followed closely by yellow and orange.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Yellow and orange make people feel hungry.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Brown helps establish a soft and authentic feel to your website.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Blues, especially darker shades, or using too much blue overall can make your website feel uncaring and cold.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Blue is also said to curb the appetite, so it’s not the best choice for a recipe collection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_17">4.3.2 Finding design inspiration using AI</h3>
<p class="body">As an experiment, let’s ask image-generator Midjourney to give us four designs for our site.

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 4.6 This design also calls for simplification in both the amount of text and the number of images, but that 3-D shadowed effect with the herbs on the left is an excellent idea.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">Aside from some alien flowers and vegetables (and the bizarre text), these images look like a good starting point for inspiration. From Midjourney or other AI image generators, you can get often surprisingly good ideas for color combinations, layout, typography, balance, and text or image placement. What’s intriguing is that AI art usually seems to somehow employ rules taught in art school about such qualities as balance, line, symmetry, color, contrast, composition, and so on.</p>
<p class="body">Midjourney produces four images for each prompt, so it’s easy to generate lots of alternatives. And it’s simple to <i class="fm-italics">rerun</i> or <i class="fm-italics">vary</i> the resulting images. If there’s something you want to eliminate from the resulting images, use the <span>–no</span> command as was done previously when blocking blue and orange. Van Gogh said, “There is no blue without yellow and without orange.” But we didn’t want either blue or orange, so we told Midjourney that.</p>
<p class="body">Try variations on your prompt until a design really stands out. For example, try switching the weighting: <code class="fm-code-in-text">brown::1</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">yellow::2</code>. Or refine the best one of Midjourney’s four images by upscaling it, and then choosing Vary or Zoom options. You can also remix, modifying the prompt somewhat. This back and forth between you and Midjourney can produce the outstanding final result you’re looking for.</p>

<p class="fm-calloute"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> Canva itself doesn’t offer prompting (yet). So if you go to Canva via the GPT Canva plugin, you get the advantage of AI. A prompt gets you better results usually. Recall that traditional searches only give you a list of links to places that you need to visit to look for answers. However, Canva <i class="fm-italics">is</i> actively working on adding AI features (<a id="marker-108"/>see <a class="url" href="https://www.canva.com/magic/">www.canva.com/magic/</a>).</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   3.  GPT will show you a selection of pictures of sample home pages, with links to Canva.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   4.  Click the link that displays a home page sample template closest to what you’re after. That takes you to the free version of Canva.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   5.  In the sidebar on Canva, scroll to see if you find any templates you like better (see figure 4.8).</p>

<p class="body-dialog">   8.  Scroll through hundreds of designs. Try different search terms like “minimalist” or “contemporary”.</p>

<p class="body-dialog">  10.  Scroll again if you wish. When you finally find the right one, click Resize on the top menu. Create the shape you want.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">  11.  Double-click the text in the design to customize that.</p>

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_19">4.3.4 A home page checklist</h3>
<p class="body">Preplan your home page by thinking about these suggestions:<a id="idIndexMarker096"/><a id="marker-109"/><a id="idIndexMarker097"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Write a brief, catchy, descriptive page title.</i> It should summarize your site’s purpose. And include a brief paragraph going into more detail about what benefits the site offers. Home page real estate is all about concision, concision, concision. If you absolutely must display longer text content, break it up with subheadings or a bulleted list, and locate it lower in the page.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">People understand the meaning of visuals more quickly than text.</i> Choose images that contribute to instant understanding of the site’s purpose. Include no images merely for decorative purposes. And limit background decoration to ensure that it doesn’t compete with your images. Keep brevity and focus in mind at all times. Studies have shown that your visitors decide whether to stay or go within milliseconds, so you don’t have much time to captivate them.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Be single-minded about promoting your goal for the site.</i> There should only be one primary goal. If you’re writing a travel blog, don’t weaken the focus by including health tips on the home page. It’s fine to have an interior child page devoted to staying healthy while traveling, but keep it interior. On the home page, limit the health topic to a single concept. Ensure that everything on the home page serves your one, main purpose.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Avoid bounce.</i> <i class="fm-italics">Bounce</i> means somebody visits your home page but immediately bounces back out to go to another site, without visiting your interior pages, or even looking at much of your home page.</p>
<p class="list">Recall that experts say that, on average, people visiting your site make up their mind whether to stay or leave within .05 seconds. And if your home page survives this ultra-quick snap judgement, it’s still probable that they’ll leave within the next 20 seconds unless you manage to hook them. Technically, internet marketing experts look at data they call <i class="fm-italics">bounce rate</i>: the percentage of visitors who view the home page without continuing to view other pages in the site. We’ll look at how you can work with this metric (and many others) in a later chapter on website analytics.<a id="idIndexMarker098"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Don’t make them scroll.</i> People won’t be around long enough to find out whether there’s something they’d find valuable if you place it below the initial screen. Keep your most magnetic content near the top of the home page screen. If you think you have more space to hook people, just remember that current estimates are that about 50% of internet viewing is on portable (that is, small) screens, with phones dominant. Hook them from the very top.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Decide what next step you want your visitor to take.</i> Should they click a link to a page that displays your products? Do you want them to fill out a form so you can obtain their email for later marketing messages? Should they use your site search tool? Want them to share their views by posting on your blog? Or subscribe to your site? Or maybe make an appointment, sign a petition, or get a free trial?</p>
<p class="list">Whatever next step you want them to take is your <i class="fm-italics">call to action</i> (CTA). So, if they don’t take that step, if they bounce away, then your home page has failed.<a id="idIndexMarker099"/><a id="idIndexMarker100"/><a id="marker-110"/></p>
<p class="list">Make the CTA look visually different from the other content (contrasting colors, for example), and include a simple, strong text description like “See our most popular recipe” or “Sign up for extra recipes”. Maybe give them an incentive to follow the CTA by offering to send them your 10 best recipes if they provide their email address. Make it clear to them what reward you’re offering. Perhaps offer a discount on their first order. Whatever it takes to prevent the bounce out of your site: “Only three left!” “Sign up for exclusive offers.” “Watch the video now.”</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Remove exits.</i> Don’t show them links that leave your site. Some sites even hide their menu—replacing it with a three-line hamburger icon, or just the word Menu. That’s a fairly extreme, and rather manipulative, approach. But do avoid putting social media buttons on the home page that might tempt them to click and fly away to Facebook or X.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Refine and revise.</i> A home page, like any creative endeavor, is never really perfected. Watch their behavior as friends or relatives try different versions of your home page. One version is likely to have the most successful CTA. And install the analytics plugins that we’ll look at later in the book. They show you how your visitors behave, where they came from, what pathways through your site they took, how long they viewed different pages, and other data that can help you improve the site.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Generate trust.</i> Testimonials are a powerful tool to demonstrate the value and quality of your site. Think about adding a couple of brief, glowing comments from visitors to the home page. It’s good to display the names, locations, and photos of these people to make them seem more authentic. Also perhaps include an interior page with additional testimonials. Testimonials are slightly different from reviews—the former are entirely positive, but the latter, to be believed, must contain at least a few critical comments.</p>

</ul>
<p class="body">In this chapter, you set things up in preparation for content creation and site design. You first explored ways to choose the best typeface, and associated qualities, that will make your text content look great. Next, you saw ways to achieve a writing style that makes your audience want to read what you have to say. And the chapter concluded by putting what you’ve learned so far into action: creating a compelling home page.</p>
<p class="body">In the next chapter we’ll look at plugins—small programs that can be added to your site with the click of a button. They include utilities such as spam blockers or features for your site’s visitors, such as an events calendar. We’ll also see how you can create your own custom plugins by describing what you want to an AI.<a id="marker-111"/><a id="idIndexMarker101"/><a id="idIndexMarker102"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_20">Summary</h2>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Typography is a more important factor in a site’s success than many realize. Your theme will likely specify some defaults—typeface, size, and other font elements—but you should see if these choices might be improved.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Learn to write in the conversational style found in many websites. Unless a site must convey solidity and seriousness—such as legal or academic sites—people generally expect an informal tone.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Your home page must hook your readers very quickly and send them to the target of your call to action (CTA). People make snap judgements pretty fast when they first visit a site, and unless you impress them, they’re gone.</p>
