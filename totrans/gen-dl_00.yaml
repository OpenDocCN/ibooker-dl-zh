- en: This book is becoming part of my life. On finding a copy in my living room I
    asked my son, “When did you get this?” He replied, “When you gave it to me,” bemused
    by my senior moment. Going through various sections together, I came to regard
    *Generative Deep Learning* as the *Gray’s Anatomy* of Generative AI.

- en: The author dissects the anatomy of generative AI with an incredible clarity
    and reassuring authority. He offers a truly remarkable account of a fast-moving
    field, underwritten with pragmatic examples, engaging narratives, and references
    that are so current, it reads like a living history.

- en: Throughout his deconstructions, the author maintains a sense of wonder and excitement
    about the potential of generative AI—especially evident in the book’s compelling
    dénouement. Having laid bare the technology, he reminds us that we are at the
    dawn of a new age of intelligence, an age in which generative AI holds a mirror
    up to our language, our art, our creativity; reflecting not just what we have
    created, but what we could create—what we can create—limited only by “your own
    imagination.”

- en: The central theme of generative models in artificial intelligence resonates
    deeply with me, because I see exactly the same themes emerging in the natural
    sciences; namely, a view of ourselves as generative models of our lived world.
    I suspect in the next edition of this book we will read about the confluence of
    artificial and natural intelligence. Until that time, I will keep this edition
    next to my copy of *Gray’s Anatomy*, and other treasures on my bookshelf.
