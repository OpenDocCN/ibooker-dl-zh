&#13;
<p>In <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-type="indexterm" id="icd301"/>this chapter, we’ll look at AI workloads and the key factors you need to know for implementing them responsibly. These workloads, which make up about 15%–20% of the AI-900 exam, are about understanding how AI works in different areas like content moderation, personalization, computer vision, NLP, knowledge mining, and document intelligence. These are the building blocks that power AI applications. They help systems analyze images, understand human language, extract insights from huge amounts of data, and create content using generative AI.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>But it’s not just about knowing what these AI workloads can do. We’ll also look at the ethical and practical considerations that are crucial when developing responsible AI. We’ll talk about key principles like accountability, inclusiveness, reliability, safety, fairness, transparency, security, and privacy. These principles are essential for ensuring that AI is not only powerful but also ethical, trustworthy, and aligned with the values that matter to society.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>AI <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="overview of" data-type="indexterm" id="id348"/>is about helping computers think and respond like humans. Imagine it this way: AI lets computers make decisions, solve problems, understand language, recognize images, and create new things, just like a person would. The secret sauce behind AI is how it learns from data—a lot of data—to recognize patterns and make predictions. With AI, businesses can automate tasks, uncover insights buried in mountains of information, and work faster and smarter than ever.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The diagram in <a data-type="xref" href="#i03_chapter3_figure_1_1742068261117999">Figure 3-1</a> is a good way of understanding AI. It illustrates that AI is not a single technology but essentially a group of different technologies and methods that build on each other to solve complex problems.</p>&#13;

<p>At the broadest level, AI encompasses all technologies that enable machines to mimic human intelligence. This includes tasks like problem solving, decision making, language understanding, and pattern recognition. AI systems can be rule based or data driven, and they aim to perform functions that traditionally require human <span class="keep-together">cognition</span>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Machine learning (ML)</em>, a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ML (machine learning)" data-secondary="defined" data-type="indexterm" id="id349"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="machine learning" data-see="ML" data-type="indexterm" id="id350"/>subset <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="categories of" data-type="indexterm" id="icd302"/>of AI, focuses on enabling machines to learn from data without explicit programming. ML <em>algorithms</em> <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="algorithms" data-secondary="defined" data-type="indexterm" id="id351"/>identify patterns in data and use those patterns to make predictions or decisions. This allows systems to improve their performance over time as they process more data. ML is commonly used for applications like recommendation systems, fraud detection, and predictive analytics.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Deep learning (DL)</em> is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="DL (deep learning)" data-secondary="defined" data-type="indexterm" id="id352"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="deep learning" data-see="DL" data-type="indexterm" id="id353"/> a specialized subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. These networks process data through multiple layers, allowing DL models to identify complex patterns and relationships. DL has been responsible for significant breakthroughs in areas like image recognition, speech processing, and natural language understanding.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Within deep learning lies <em>generative AI.</em> This <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="generative AI" data-secondary="defined" data-type="indexterm" id="id354"/>is a cutting-edge technology that focuses on creating new content, which can include text, images, audio, and video. Generative AI is transforming industries by enabling applications such as automated content creation, image synthesis, and creative problem solving.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Together, these technologies represent an evolution in how machines learn, adapt, and perform tasks, each layer offering increasingly powerful capabilities. In the next few sections, we’ll look at some of these categories. We’ll also explore specialized AI capabilities in Microsoft Azure.</p>&#13;

<h2>Personalization</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Azure AI Personalizer</em> is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="categories of" data-tertiary="personalization" data-type="indexterm" id="id372"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="personalization" data-type="indexterm" id="id373"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Personalizer" data-type="indexterm" id="id374"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Personalizer Service" data-type="indexterm" id="id375"/> a tool that helps your apps make smarter decisions by using <em>reinforcement learning</em>: a type<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="reinforcement learning" data-type="indexterm" id="id376"/> of ML <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ML (machine learning)" data-secondary="reinforcement learning" data-type="indexterm" id="id377"/>where the AI learns by getting feedback on its actions. Basically, it improves by trial and error. The Personalizer looks at the context of your app, such as what a user is doing or where they are, and considers a set of possible actions to figure out the best decision. When it makes a decision, you give it feedback, called a <em>reward</em>, which helps it learn and improve its choices in real time.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can use the Personalizer in lots of different situations. For instance, in an ecommerce context, it could decide which product to show a customer to boost the chances that they’ll make a purchase. Another common use is for content recommendation, such as figuring out which suggested article will get the most clicks.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>But keep in mind that Azure AI Personalizer will be deprecated in October 2026. Even though the AI-900 exam still includes it as a topic, it’s possible that a replacement service will appear later. The core principles of personalization are likely to remain part of the exam, so it’s worth keeping them in mind.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Here’s a breakdown of how Personalizer works:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Context</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="context, in personalization" data-type="indexterm" id="id378"/> information about your app, users, or scenario that can influence decisions (e.g., location, device type, user preferences)</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Actions</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>A <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="actions, in personalization" data-type="indexterm" id="id379"/>set of potential decisions or items, each with its own attributes (e.g., a list of products or articles)</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Reward</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>A <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="rewards, in personalization" data-type="indexterm" id="id380"/>score between 0 and 1 that shows how good the decision was (e.g., if a user clicks on a recommended article, it gets a score of 1)</p>&#13;

<h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Natural language processing (NLP)</em> is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="categories of" data-tertiary="natural language processing" data-type="indexterm" id="icd307"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="NLP (natural language processing)" data-type="indexterm" id="icd308"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Language" data-type="indexterm" id="icd309"/> a<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="natural language processing" data-see="NLP" data-type="indexterm" id="id392"/> technology that helps machines understand and respond to human language. Basically, it’s what allows computers to hold a conversation with you. At its core, NLP breaks down human language—whether it’s spoken or written—into something machines can understand. This means computers don’t just recognize words but can also figure out the intent behind full sentences or paragraphs. You’ve probably already used NLP without even thinking about it, like when you ask Siri a question or chat with a bot to get help online.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>One of NLP’s biggest jobs is making sense of the messy, unstructured way that humans communicate. Let’s face it—we don’t always speak or write perfectly. We use slang, have different ways of saying the same thing, and can sometimes be inconsistent. Machines, on the other hand, are used to structured data. NLP bridges that gap. It deals with all the quirks of language, like grammar and context, so that machines can respond more naturally. Whether it’s translating languages, summarizing news articles, or taking voice commands, NLP is behind a lot of the AI-powered technology we use today.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>But NLP isn’t just about understanding words; it’s about getting the meaning. For instance, if you ask a voice assistant, “What’s the weather like?” it doesn’t just pick out “weather” and “like.” It processes the whole sentence to understand that you’re asking for a forecast. This deeper understanding, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="semantics" data-secondary="natural language processing" data-type="indexterm" id="id393"/>called <em>semantics</em>, is what makes NLP different from basic text matching. It’s what helps AI generate responses that feel more human and natural.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Microsoft offers a service called Azure AI Language that lets you work with NLP. It combines three tools—text analytics, QnA Maker, and LUIS (Language Understanding)—under one roof and adds new features. These features come in two flavors: preconfigured, where you use AI models as is without tweaking anything, and customizable, where you can train the models with your own data.</p>&#13;

<p><em>Knowledge mining</em> uses<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="categories of" data-tertiary="knowledge mining" data-type="indexterm" id="id410"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="knowledge mining" data-type="indexterm" id="id411"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Knowledge Mining" data-type="indexterm" id="id412"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Knowledge Mining Service" data-type="indexterm" id="id413"/> AI to interpret vast amounts of data. Often, the focus is on <em>unstructured data</em>, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="unstructured data" data-type="indexterm" id="id414"/>which is information that lacks a predefined format, such as text documents, emails, texts, images, and videos. In contrast, <em>structured data</em> is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="structured data" data-type="indexterm" id="id415"/> organized in a standardized format, typically in tables with rows and columns, making it easily searchable and analyzable.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The process for knowledge mining is fairly simple: you gather your data, enhance it with AI tools like language or image recognition, and then explore it through search and visualizations. This way, you can quickly find the connections you need to make better decisions.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Microsoft has developed <em>Azure AI Knowledge Mining</em> to make this process easier. It combines AI, ML, and search technology to help you extract, enrich, and explore your data. Here are some of the key features:</p>&#13;

<h2>Document Intelligence</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Document intelligence</em>, also<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="categories of" data-tertiary="document intelligence" data-type="indexterm" id="id421"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="document intelligence (document AI)" data-type="indexterm" id="icd1023"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Document Intelligence" data-type="indexterm" id="icd1018"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Document Intelligence Service" data-type="indexterm" id="icd1029"/> referred to as <em>document AI</em>, uses AI to automate the extraction, comprehension, and organization of data from various documents, such as forms, invoices, and receipts. This technology transforms unstructured <span class="keep-together">information</span> into structured, actionable data, improving efficiency and accuracy in data <span class="keep-together">processing</span>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It’s easy to confuse document intelligence with knowledge mining. However, for the exam, it’s important to know the differences. Document intelligence focuses on extracting and structuring data from individual documents, automating tasks like data entry and form processing. In contrast, knowledge mining involves analyzing large volumes of data to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights across an organization’s entire data estate. While both use AI to process data, document intelligence operates at the document level whereas knowledge mining works at a broader, cross-document level to facilitate comprehensive data exploration and discovery.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As for Azure, there is the <em>Azure AI Document Intelligence</em> service. Here are the main features:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>General extraction models</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>These <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="general extraction models, for document intelligence" data-type="indexterm" id="id422"/>models are designed to work across a wide range of documents without needing customization. They can pull out key details like text, tables, key-value pairs, and the overall structure of a document. This makes them good for organizations that handle various types of documents and need consistent data extraction. Whether the document is structured, semistructured, or unstructured, these models provide quick, reliable results without needing any training or labeling.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Prebuilt models</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Azure<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="prebuilt models, for document intelligence" data-type="indexterm" id="id423"/> also provides ready-to-use models for common document types, such as invoices, receipts, identity documents, and tax forms. These models are preconfigured to extract specific data fields like dates, payment amounts, or personal details. For example, the prebuilt models can handle W-2 forms and include support for other documents, such as 1099 tax forms and health insurance cards.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Custom models</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>If you<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="custom models, for document intelligence" data-type="indexterm" id="id424"/> have more specific needs, Azure lets you create custom models tailored to your business. You can train these models using your own data, so they know exactly what information to look for in your documents. Azure offers two types of custom models: template models, which are great if your documents follow a similar structure, and neural models, which are flexible enough to handle documents with different layouts.</p>&#13;

<h2>Generative AI</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Azure OpenAI Service</em> provides<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="categories of" data-tertiary="generative AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id425"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="generative AI" data-secondary="overview of" data-type="indexterm" id="id426"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure OpenAI Service" data-secondary="overview of" data-type="indexterm" id="id427"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenAI Service" data-see="Azure OpenAI Service" data-type="indexterm" id="id428"/> developers with a comprehensive toolkit to create generative AI applications that can transform various business operations. It allows for the development of custom AI copilots and agents, giving companies the flexibility to integrate AI into their workflows. One of the standout features is its support for different AI models, such as GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, embeddings, and Whisper.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The Azure OpenAI Studio, which serves as the main user interface for the service, simplifies the management and customization of these models. Users can explore, fine-tune, and deploy models directly from the studio. This makes it an accessible solution for both technical and nontechnical users.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>What’s more, Azure OpenAI supports advanced capabilities, such as <em>retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</em>. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)" data-type="indexterm" id="id429"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)" data-type="indexterm" id="id430"/>This technique allows developers to run models on specific datasets, providing more accurate and contextually grounded outputs. For organizations looking to automate knowledge-based tasks, this feature enhances the AI’s ability to generate precise responses based on their proprietary information.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For example, a company can implement RAG by integrating Azure OpenAI Service with Azure AI Search to create a chatbot that answers employee questions about internal policies, like health benefits. By indexing company documents and using RAG, the AI can retrieve relevant information and provide accurate, context-specific responses to employee inquiries.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In the creative domain, Azure OpenAI models like DALL-E open new doors for content generation. This allows designers and marketers to produce unique visuals from simple text prompts. The technology has been particularly impactful in media and entertainment, where quick, dynamic content creation is crucial to keeping up with consumer demand.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>So yes, Azure certainly has many AI services available—and it can be difficult to understand all of them.

<h1>Guiding Principles for Responsible AI</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>AI <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="principles for responsible AI" data-type="indexterm" id="icd310"/>is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="responsible AI" data-type="indexterm" id="icd311"/>an incredibly powerful tool that’s transforming industries and making our lives easier in all kinds of ways. But like any tool, it comes with risks we need to be <span class="keep-together">aware of</span>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>One big concern is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="bias" data-type="indexterm" id="id448"/> bias <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="risks" data-type="indexterm" id="id449"/>in AI models, which can lead to unfair results. For example, imagine a loan-approval system that discriminates based on gender because it was trained on biased data. This can have serious consequences. It can lead to inequalities, damage of trust in AI systems, and legal or regulatory repercussions for businesses.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>But here are other risks:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Potential for errors, such as autonomous vehicle malfunctions, that could cause accidents</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Concerns about how AI uses data, especially sensitive information like patient data in medical bots, which could be exposed if not securely stored</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>AI solutions that may not be inclusive for all users, such as a home assistant without audio output that excludes visually impaired users</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Accountability concerns in AI decision making, such as wrongful convictions due to faulty facial recognition</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To address these challenges, Microsoft has created six guiding principles for <em>responsible AI</em>, which fall into two main categories:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Ethical AI</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Ensures <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ethical AI" data-secondary="defined" data-type="indexterm" id="id450"/>that AI systems are designed and used in a way that aligns with moral principles like accountability, inclusiveness, reliability, and safety</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Explainable AI</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Focuses<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="explainable AI" data-secondary="defined" data-type="indexterm" id="id451"/> on making AI systems transparent and easy to understand; includes principles like fairness, transparency, security, and privacy</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Microsoft’s six guidelines are common for questions on the exam, so you should memorize them and understand how they apply to different scenarios. In the rest of this chapter, we’ll take a closer look at each of these principles.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Accountability" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="i03_chapter3_accountability_1742068261134435">&#13;
<h2>Accountability</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ethical AI" data-secondary="accountability" data-type="indexterm" id="id452"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="principles for responsible AI" data-tertiary="accountability" data-type="indexterm" id="id453"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="accountability" data-type="indexterm" id="id454"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="responsible AI" data-secondary="accountability" data-type="indexterm" id="id455"/>you’re working on designing and deploying AI systems, the responsibility lies with you to ensure that they operate ethically and safely. You’ve got to make sure the technology aligns with both legal and industry standards—essentially, you’re making sure it’s fair, responsible, and trustworthy. Take Microsoft’s approach: creating a framework that prioritizes <em>accountability</em>, starting with impact assessments early on. These assessments look at how AI might affect individuals, organizations, and society. By keeping a close eye on these evaluations, especially when something could go wrong, you can manage risks throughout the AI’s lifespan.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>But accountability doesn’t end with the launch. Microsoft advocates for human oversight, making sure that AI doesn’t run the show without meaningful human input. The people managing these systems need the right tools to maintain control and step in when necessary. This keeps you from becoming overly reliant on AI outputs—ensuring that human accountability is always part of the equation—especially in more complex or high-stakes situations.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To keep things in check, it’s essential to set up internal review teams. These teams can oversee key decisions related to AI development and deployment, particularly in sensitive areas like health care, employment, or facial recognition. If misused, these tools can potentially cause physical or emotional harm or infringe on people’s rights. That’s why it’s so important to have clear legal boundaries to prevent overreach and protect individual freedoms.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Laws and regulations play a huge role in maintaining AI accountability, but they’re only part of the puzzle. Businesses, governments, and other stakeholders also have to take responsibility. Microsoft, for instance, has developed its own guiding principles for working with sensitive tech like facial recognition. Microsoft knows that these principles will evolve as it learns more from working with customers, academics, and civil society. This kind of open conversation—among companies, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and researchers—is critical to making sure that AI evolves responsibly. It’s also important to keep your team trained, bring in experts for big decisions, and have a solid governance system in place to ensure that you’re maintaining accountability.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Inclusiveness" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="i03_chapter3_inclusiveness_1742068261134488">&#13;
<h2>Inclusiveness</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Creating <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ethical AI" data-secondary="inclusiveness" data-type="indexterm" id="id456"/>AI<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="principles for responsible AI" data-tertiary="inclusiveness" data-type="indexterm" id="id457"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="inclusiveness" data-type="indexterm" id="id458"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="responsible AI" data-secondary="inclusiveness" data-type="indexterm" id="id459"/> that works for everyone starts with making sure it’s accessible, no matter a person’s abilities. Tools like speech-to-text and text-to-speech are especially helpful for those with hearing or vision impairments. By including these features, you can make sure that nobody misses out on the benefits that AI has to offer.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>But accessibility isn’t just about the technology—it’s also about the people who create it. Having diverse teams, with members from various backgrounds and life experiences, is key to developing AI that truly works for everyone. When you bring different perspectives into the conversation, you’re better equipped to spot biases and ensure that AI systems are designed to be fair and inclusive. <em>Inclusive design</em> is about creating AI systems that are usable by as many people as possible. This is especially true for those traditionally excluded due to factors like ability, language, culture, gender, or age. By embracing inclusive design, developers can identify and tackle barriers that might otherwise leave people out. This paves the way for better experiences for all users.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It’s equally important to involve the communities that AI is meant to serve. Partnering with organizations and advocacy groups ensures that underrepresented voices are heard. This makes AI more responsive to their specific needs. Using widely recognized accessibility standards also helps ensure that AI systems are genuinely <span class="keep-together">inclusive</span>.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Reliability and Safety" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="i03_chapter3_reliability_and_safety_1742068261134541">&#13;
<h2>Reliability and Safety</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ethical AI" data-secondary="reliability and safety" data-type="indexterm" id="id460"/>AI <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="principles for responsible AI" data-tertiary="reliability and safety" data-type="indexterm" id="id461"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="reliability and safety" data-type="indexterm" id="id462"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="responsible AI" data-secondary="reliability and safety" data-type="indexterm" id="id463"/>systems to earn your trust, they need to work reliably, safely, and consistently—even when things don’t go as planned. AI should do what it’s designed to do, handle the unexpected without failing, and resist any attempts to manipulate it in harmful ways. Verifying how AI behaves in real-world situations is key since this shows whether developers prepared for a wide range of scenarios during the design and testing process.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A big part of development is testing the AI thoroughly to make sure it can handle edge cases and surprises safely, without unexpected glitches. But it doesn’t stop there. Once deployed, AI systems need ongoing maintenance and protection. If left unchecked, they can degrade over time and become unreliable or inaccurate.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Human judgment is also critical in making sure AI stays on track. Since AI is meant to boost human capabilities, it’s up to people to decide when and how to use these systems and whether they should keep using them. This kind of human oversight helps reveal blind spots and biases that might otherwise go unnoticed.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To boost <em>reliability and safety</em>, start by understanding where your AI stands in terms of maturity. Regularly audit the system, design it to handle the unexpected, and make sure you’re involving experts in its development. Thorough testing, clear explanations of how the system works, and ways for users to give feedback are all essential steps.</p>&#13;

For example, if AI is helping make decisions about medical treatments, loan approvals, or hiring, it should give the same recommendations for people with similar health conditions, financial backgrounds, or qualifications. Fairness means AI shouldn’t introduce or amplify biases that unfairly benefit or harm certain groups.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To tackle <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="bias" data-type="indexterm" id="id465"/>bias, you first need to recognize that AI’s predictions and recommendations have limits. While AI offers helpful insights, humans are ultimately responsible for making decisions that affect people’s lives. That’s why it’s important to train people to understand AI outputs correctly and use their own judgment to avoid unfair <span class="keep-together">consequences</span>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Developers play a major role in preventing bias during the AI development process. They need to be aware of how bias can creep in during the design phase and how it might affect the system’s recommendations. One way to minimize bias is by using diverse training datasets. For instance, an AI tool designed to screen job applicants might start favoring male candidates if it’s trained on biased data from a male-dominated field. By auditing the AI model before it’s deployed, developers can catch and fix these biases early on.</p>&#13;

When AI is involved in decisions that significantly affect people’s lives, it’s crucial that those who are affected understand how these decisions are being made.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A big part of transparency <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="intelligibility" data-type="indexterm" id="id467"/>is <em>intelligibility</em> or <em>explainability</em>, meaning<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="explainability" data-type="indexterm" id="id468"/> that you should be able to clearly explain how the AI system behaves. To improve this, you need to ensure that people can easily grasp how these systems work so they can identify any potential issues—whether it’s about performance, safety, privacy, bias, or unexpected outcomes. Plus, organizations using AI need to be upfront about when they’re using these systems, why they’re using them, and how they’re making decisions.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Here are a few ways to boost transparency:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Share key details about the datasets used</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Make AI models easier to understand by using simpler ones and explaining how they work</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;

<h2>Security and Privacy</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="explainable AI" data-secondary="security and privacy" data-type="indexterm" id="id469"/>AI <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="principles for responsible AI" data-tertiary="security and privacy" data-type="indexterm" id="id470"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="security and privacy" data-type="indexterm" id="id471"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="responsible AI" data-secondary="security and privacy" data-type="indexterm" id="id472"/>becomes more common, safeguarding privacy and securing personal and business data have become even more critical and complicated. AI systems need access to data to make accurate predictions and decisions, but this raises important concerns about privacy and data security. These systems must follow privacy laws that require transparency in how data is collected, used, and stored while also giving consumers control over their own information.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>One of Microsoft’s biggest lessons in this area came back in 2016 when it launched Tay, a chatbot<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tay chatbot" data-type="indexterm" id="id473"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Microsoft" data-secondary="Tay chatbot" data-type="indexterm" id="id474"/> on Twitter. Tay was designed to learn from user interactions to mimic human conversation. But within 24 hours, users took advantage of Tay’s learning process, feeding it offensive content and turning the chatbot into a platform for hate speech. This incident showed just how important it is to consider the human element when designing AI systems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>From this experience, Microsoft realized the need to prepare for new types of attacks—especially those that manipulate AI learning datasets. To prevent future incidents, Microsoft developed advanced content-filtering tools and introduced more oversight for AI systems that learn automatically.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To ensure <em>security and privacy</em> in AI, organizations should follow a few key practices:</p>&#13;
	<ul>&#13;
		<li><p>Comply with data protection and privacy laws.</p></li>&#13;
		<li><p>Design systems to protect against bad actors.</p></li>&#13;
		<li><p>Give customers control over their data.</p></li>&#13;
		<li><p>Ensure the anonymity and integrity of personal information.</p></li>&#13;
