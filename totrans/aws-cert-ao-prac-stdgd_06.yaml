    strong economic growth, especially in the US. A key driver was the adoption of
    electricity, which led to the assembly line, sophisticated machine tools, improved
    transportation, and better communications.

    Jay Sussman, with connecting a camera to a computer to see if it could interpret
    its environment. This “Vision Project” marked the emergence of computer vision
    but proved exceedingly difficult due to the limited systems and algorithms of
    the time.

- en: The first practical application of computer vision, OCR, appeared in the mid-1970s
    for processing documents and invoices. However, the field saw its next major leap
    in 2012, when a deep learning model using a convolutional neural network (CNN)
    demonstrated remarkable image recognition capabilities. A key catalyst for this
    was ImageNet, a large dataset of over 14 million labeled images developed by researcher
    Fei-Fei Li, which provided a benchmark for measuring the accuracy of computer
    vision systems.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a process of transforming a word to its root or *lemma*, which removes
    affixes and suffixes. For example, the word *running* is turned into *run*. Lemmatization
    helps to find better matches as there is a broader meaning. It is also a common
    approach with search engines.

    off the ends of words without considering context. For example, the words *running*,
    *runs*, and *runner* might all be reduced to *run*. It’s a faster, more rule-based
    method than lemmatization, though it may result in less accurate roots.

    from text, and they use AI to do this. Yet there are clear differences between
    the two. Whereas NLP has broad applications—such as for chatbots, language translation,

    and processing of data. Generally, this is for business purposes, such as handling
    invoices and contracts.

    of relevant details—like the patient names, diagnoses, and referring physicians—and

    were more than $480 billion.^([1](ch05.html#ch01fn24)) To combat fraud, financial
    services firms spend substantial amounts on software.

- en: A big part of this is the use of AI. Techniques like classification and clustering
    can be helpful in detecting fraud. The same goes with using anomaly detection,
    which will look for outliers and unusual patterns in data. Generative AI has been
    useful for this approach.

- en: As we have seen in this chapter, there are many applications for AI. But this
    powerful technology should not always be used. For example, there may be cases
    when a simple software solution will be the best option. This could be using RPA
    for data entry or mapping routine processes. If you used AI for this, it would
    likely involve a complex implementation and be costly. It would essentially be
    overkill.

- en: 'This brings up another important challenge: the need for deterministic outcomes.
    In certain high-stakes fields—such as healthcare or financial services—software
    is expected to produce consistent, reliable, and accurate results. But generative
    AI models often introduce variability in their responses. This unpredictability
    can be risky because even small deviations or inaccuracies could lead to serious
    consequences, like a misdiagnosis or financial error.'
