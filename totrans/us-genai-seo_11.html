      <h1><span class="label">Chapter 8. </span>The Future of Generative AI <span class="keep-together">and SEO</span></h1>
      <p>Generative AI is <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="generative AI" data-secondary="future of" data-see="future of generative AI and SEO" id="id818"/>still evolving, so our approach to using it with search engines and SEO must change as well. By identifying emerging trends and potential enhancements, you can better prepare for the future and stay ahead of your competitors.</p>
      <p>In this chapter, we’ll examine emerging trends in generative AI and their implications for the future of SEO. We’ll explore how these trends will reshape our day-to-day SEO practices. Our primary objective will be to equip SEO professionals with the foresight necessary to anticipate and adapt to these changes. </p>
      <p>A common question among SEO professionals is “Will generative AI search steal massive market share from Google?” This chapter will address those concerns and provide an expert view on the future of generative AI and search engines.</p>
      <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Anticipating the Evolving Landscape of Generative AI and SEO"><div class="sect1" id="ch08_anticipating_the_evolving_landscape_of_generative_1748358221787546">
        <h1>Anticipating the Evolving Landscape of Generative AI and SEO</h1>
        <p>Until now, <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SEO (search engine optimization)" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="what to expect" id="seo-future-what-to-expect"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="future of generative AI and SEO" data-secondary="what to expect" id="future-what-to-expect"/>we’ve discussed the many advantages and limitations of AI as it currently functions. LLMs and generative AI will continue to evolve, and you must account for those changes in your future SEO strategies. In this section, we’ll discuss what you can expect of generative AI in the future and how that will affect SEO professionals and business owners.</p>
        <p>The first<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI-generated content" data-secondary="future quality of" id="id819"/> area where we foresee changes is in the overall quality of AI-generated content. Text content will sound more humanlike. As a result, marketing content—including ad copy—will be more appealing to customers. Images and videos will look more realistic and natural. SEO practitioners will find it easier to develop content. This doesn’t change the fact that AI-generated content will still need human oversight. As we’ve emphasized throughout this book, if you do not have a human reviewer, you risk your brand’s reputation by putting out content rife with misinformation and inaccuracies or content that sounds too robotic to resonate with users. In addition, you have lost the opportunity to put forth your organization’s perspective and insights.</p>
        <p>Second, <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="regulations" data-secondary="future of" id="id820"/>we’ll see new regulations and laws regarding the use of generative AI. Laws currently are not set up to protect non-human-generated art and text. In the future, we’ll see more regulations to control what can be owned and what constitutes copyright infringement as artists’ work is used to train AI models. More laws will oversee and limit the use of other art to generate images. However, SEO practitioners will continue to use generative AI to create basic logos and for image search and editing. For more details, see <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_copyright_concerns_1748358211790817">“Copyright Concerns”</a>.</p>
        <p>Third, Google will remain a search engine and generative AI leader, for reasons we’ll discuss in the following sections of this chapter. Users will see more AI-generated content alongside traditional search results, which could affect trust and search engine ranking. Companies that offer users informational content will need to focus on getting their content to become one of the sources for AI-generated responses in addition to ranking in traditional search results. Companies will compete for their pages to be used as part of the AI search overviews.</p>
        <p>Fourth, SEO practitioners and developers should better utilize generative AI to increase the velocity of coding websites and desktop and mobile applications. From user interface designs developed for better optimization and engagement to backend code snippets, generative AI can help get your websites and applications in front of customers sooner.</p>
        <p>Finally, generative AI will streamline the work of SEO practitioners and video producers. AI models will get better at processing videos and producing accurate subtitles, alternative text, and transcripts. It’s also foreseeable that translations of video into other languages will improve.</p>
        <p>Although switching to a focus on generative AI results may sound overwhelming, remember that your primary focus should continue to be on quality and providing value to users. Having authoritative content will become more important than in previous years because generative AI tool vendors will strive to use trustworthy content. SEO professionals will need SMEs and careful oversight of any generative AI content to ensure that it meets Google’s authoritative content <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SEO (search engine optimization)" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="what to expect" data-startref="seo-future-what-to-expect" id="id821"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="future of generative AI and SEO" data-secondary="what to expect" data-startref="future-what-to-expect" id="id822"/>expectations. </p>

      <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Will Generative AI Search Overtake or Replace Search Engines?"><div class="sect1" id="ch08_will_generative_ai_search_overtake_or_replace_sear_1748358221787620">
        <h1>Will Generative AI Search Overtake or Replace Search Engines?</h1>
        <p>The <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SEO (search engine optimization)" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="generative AI versus search engines" id="seo-future-genai-vs-search"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="future of generative AI and SEO" data-secondary="generative AI versus search engines" id="future-genai-vs-search"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="generative AI" data-secondary="search engines versus" id="genai-vs-search"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="search engines" data-secondary="generative AI versus" id="search-engine-vs-genai"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Google" data-secondary="generative AI versus search engines" id="google-genai-vs-search"/>fundamental goal of SEO—to enhance a website’s visibility and ranking in search engines in order to gain relevant traffic to the website—faces a significant shift with the rise of generative AI. However, it’s unlikely that generative AI will completely replace search engines.</p>
        <p>Google will probably lose some market share to ChatGPT and other LLMs, but not a significant amount. Generative AI requires massive amounts of data, and Google has the most data in the world from its years of cataloging the web, understanding user intent and relevancy, and identifying authorities on a wide range of topics. In addition, Google has built a massive repository of facts called the <a href="https://oreil.ly/IwSxk">Knowledge Graph</a>, which provides it with a way to validate content accuracy. </p>
        <p>Many users will move to using generative AI instead of search engines to find information. For example, when a user uses a search engine to look for pizza places, their query might ask Google to find pizza restaurants close to their location. This query doesn’t always return an exact match. The top three ranking restaurants might have long wait times or not have the user’s preferred menu item. These specifics are likely found in the customer feedback, and generative AI ingests and processes feedback. Users will then go to their favorite AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT or Copilot) to ask questions rather than rely on search engine results.</p>
        <p>In contrast, a user can ask generative AI to return three pizza restaurants. Suppose the LLM returns the same three results as Google. The user can then ask the LLM to give them results based on other ingested information like wait times, menu items, and customer feedback that wouldn’t be part of on-site content. This gives SEO professionals another type of information to target on their sites: information that addresses follow-up questions. Authoritative content that focuses on these kinds of follow-up questions could help sites become a reference in an LLM output. </p>
        <p class="widows4">When it comes to search on <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="smartphones" id="id823"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Android smartphones" id="id824"/>smartphones, Google has already integrated AI (Gemini) into Android. Most Android smartphones work with Google AI when users initiate search assistance. Instead of targeting web page content, SEO practitioners will need to focus on injecting their brands into recommendations offered by smartphone AI assistants. These assistants may be even smarter in the future and will begin giving suggestions before the user asks. For example, suppose a smartphone user regularly buys flowers on a specific day for their spouse’s birthday. The assistant could recommend flower stores before the user performs a search. SEO practitioners will need to create strategies for being one of the top—or <em>the </em>top—recommendations. </p>
        <p>In this section, we’ll examine how AI will continue to affect SEO. We’ll look at how AI overviews will impact search traffic, the need to optimize for generative engines, the influence of query intent on results, and how AI will affect certain business models.</p>
        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="The Impact of AI Overviews on Search Traffic"><div class="sect2" id="ch08_the_impact_of_ai_overviews_on_search_traffic_1748358221787690">
          <h2>The Impact of AI Overviews on Search Traffic</h2>
          <p>Being in <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI Overviews (AIOs)" id="ai-overview-ch8"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AIOs (AI Overviews)" id="aio-ch8"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Google" data-secondary="AIOs (AI Overviews)" id="google-aio-ch8"/>the top three search results does not give you the same click-through traffic as before AI integration, but being a source in generative AI answers can increase search traffic. For most informational queries you type into Google, you’ll notice that the AI-generated answer takes up much of the real estate at the top of the results page. </p>
          <p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch08_figure_1_1748358221779485">Figure 8-1</a> shows what a desktop user sees after typing a query into Google Search. As you can see, AI-generated answers take up most of the screen, and only one link is shown. Results two and three—previously considered a good ranking—are not above the fold. The AI-generated answer is likely enough to satisfy many users, so the potential for informational queries to send traffic to websites via traditional web results is much lower.</p>
          <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
            <p>“Above the fold” refers<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="“above the fold”" data-primary-sortas="above the fold" id="id825"/> to search links showing up on the screen without requiring users to scroll down. Links shown below the fold have a tremendous drop in CTR. SEO professionals aim to keep their web links above the fold for better organic traffic.</p>
          </div>
          <figure><div id="ch08_figure_1_1748358221779485" class="figure">
            <img src="assets/ugai_0801.png" width="1122" height="883"/>
            <h6><span class="label">Figure 8-1. </span>Current Google layout for search results in Windows and Chrome</h6>
          </div></figure>
          <p class="pagebreak-after">An article in <a href="https://oreil.ly/xYa4S"><em>Search Engine Land</em></a> notes that AI-generated answers from search queries lowered organic traffic by 18%–64% and reduced CTR by 60%. Predictive algorithms are not new, but predictive algorithms used for generative AI could be Google’s next move for its search strategy. For example, some number-one results have been pushed down by 640 pixels, but this ranges between 200 and 2,000 pixels depending on Google’s experiments, according to the same <em>Search Engine Land</em> article. When your site is affected, you may see the same position ranking for your keywords and impressions, but the CTR will be much lower, and therefore traffic to your site will be significantly affected.</p>
          <p>Because of these layout changes, being in the top three search results—or even on the first page—is no longer good enough. You need to be a part of the AIOs: the AI-generated answers for informational queries at the top of Google SERPs. (We discussed AIOs in more detail in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_essential_background_on_generative_ai_1748358211788823">Chapter 2</a>.) As you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch08_figure_1_1748358221779485">Figure 8-1</a>, the right side of the AIO section contains reference links. The future of SEO will be to include your brand in these reference links. This<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="GEO (generative engine optimization)" id="geo"/> strategy is referred to as <em>g</em><em>enerative </em><em>e</em><em>ngine </em><em>o</em><em>ptimization</em><em> (GEO)</em>, which we will discuss in more detail shortly. </p>
          <p>SEO practitioners will battle for placement in Google’s AIOs at the top of a user’s search results. Google launched AIOs at scale in November–December 2024, and the search giant is testing results from the experiment. Because of the scale of the launch, Google should be able to systematically improve the quality of AIOs.</p>
          <p>However, if Google doesn’t send material traffic to the websites from which it sources its content, publishers will lose the incentive to provide access to their human-generated, expert content. If they stop providing such access, training future AI models—particularly in emerging fields or topics—will become difficult and lead to even more errors and omissions. So it is in Google’s best interest to highlight the sources of its AI-generated content.</p>
          <p>Instead of being in Google’s knowledge graph, an SEO should aim to be the brand used in the AI-generated content. Having subject matter expertise will be more important than before to ensure that your content is seen as valuable. With only one reference slot for AI-generated answers, brands will need to compete for that coveted position as Google’s AI answers <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI Overviews (AIOs)" data-startref="ai-overview-ch8" id="id826"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AIOs (AI Overviews)" data-startref="aio-ch8" id="id827"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Google" data-secondary="AIOs (AI Overviews)" data-startref="google-aio-ch8" id="id828"/>continue to evolve.</p>

        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Google’s New AI Mode"><div class="sect2" id="googles_new_ai_mode_ch08_1751283859527">
          <h2>Google’s New AI Mode</h2>
          <p><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI Mode" id="aimode-ch8-1"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Google" data-secondary="AI Mode" id="aimode-ch8-2"/>AI Mode is a new feature introduced by Google that provides conversational chat-type capabilities within Google Search. The introduction of AI Mode is a major step by Google to respond to the threat posed by OpenAI and ChatGPT.</p>
          <p>As of June 1, 2025, <a href="https://oreil.ly/PARME">AI Mode became available to all users in the US</a>. You can expect this to expand to other parts of the world throughout 2025.</p>
          <p class="pagebreak-before"><a data-type="xref" href="#figure_2_new_1751283384490">Figure 8-2</a> shows us how Google has integrated this into the search user interface. As you can see, the current UI has this as the first option in the menu bar, and this provides us with an indication of the priority that Google is placing on this feature.</p>
          <figure><div id="figure_2_new_1751283384490" class="figure">

            <h6><span class="label">Figure 8-2. </span>How AI Mode appears in the Google Search UI</h6>
          </div></figure>
          <p>What is AI Mode? Put simply, it’s designed to respond to user prompts with conversational responses. Like Gemini and ChatGPT, user prompts can be complex and include multiple parts and it can remember the context of prior user prompts, as well as other information about the users. It can accept text, voice, and images as input.</p>
          <p>The authors expect that Google may make AI Mode the standard mode for certain classes of queries. For example, if the user query is informational and uses natural language to ask the question, it may be a candidate for a default AI Mode response by Google.</p>
          <p>The impact of AI Mode will likely be significant. Some classes of queries will no longer receive the traditional Google Search experience. This will further lower clicks to websites, particularly for informational queries.</p>
          <p>However, this doesn’t mean that your opportunities for revenue will go away. As the role of AI in search continues to evolve, remember that the number of prospective customers for your products or services don’t change as a result.</p>
          <p>To deal with the challenges raised by these changes, you’ll need to invest time, money, and effort to stay ahead of the curve and beat your competition in figuring out how to adapt. While this may seem like a burden, bear in mind that it’s also an opportunity.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI Mode" data-startref="aimode-ch8-1" id="id829"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Google" data-secondary="AI Mode" data-startref="aimode-ch8-2" id="id830"/></p>

        <section data-type="sect2" class="pagebreak-before less_space" data-pdf-bookmark="Understanding Generative Engine Optimization"><div class="sect2" id="ch08_understanding_generative_engine_optimization_1748358221787753">
          <h2>Understanding Generative Engine Optimization</h2>
          <p>Google’s AI-generated answers<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SEO (search engine optimization)" data-secondary="GEO (generative engine optimization) versus" id="seo-geo"/> are becoming more commonplace, especially with search queries containing at least eight words. It’s <a href="https://oreil.ly/BTyn7">estimated</a> that 25% of queries containing at least eight words have AI-generated answers. The SEO landscape has changed, and one prominent difference is that ranking in the top three results on Google isn’t as big a win as it used to be. Now, you should begin to target GEO, aiming to include your organization’s web page as a reference in Google’s AI-generated results. </p>
          <p class="widows4"><a data-type="xref" href="#ch08_figure_2_1748358221779524">Figure 8-3</a> displays results for the query “What is a STEM degree?” Notice that the left is Google’s AI answer and the links on the right are the references. GEO targets the reference links on the right of the AI-generated answers to a query. Also notice that the “Show more” button expands more information, and no other links are displayed above the scroll. This means that being the first result in the traditional search results (which comes after the AI-generated answer) is not as effective as it used to be. </p>
          <figure><div id="ch08_figure_2_1748358221779524" class="figure">
            <img src="assets/ugai_0803.png" width="1112" height="385"/>
            <h6><span class="label">Figure 8-3. </span>AI-generated results for the query “What is a STEM degree?”</h6>
          </div></figure>
          <p>GEO targeting gives organizations more visibility. As Google increases the percentage of search results that include AIOs, you will need to focus more on being one of the reference links in the AIOs. You can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch08_figure_2_1748358221779524">Figure 8-3</a> that only two reference links display in the AIO. GEO will be much more competitive than traditional SEO, where being on the first page would bring in good click-through results, especially for the first three results above the fold.</p>
          <p>SEO practitioners should know that GEO results could change their metrics. Being in the top three search results could bring in the same traffic as being in eighth, ninth, or tenth place prior to the advent of AIOs. Even if you succeed in becoming one of the references in Google’s generative AI answers, remember that users receive an answer to their question without even clicking through to a third-party website. When this answer fully addresses the user’s question, they won’t need to click through to any of the source websites for more information. However, even if users don’t click as much as they do on traditional search results, there is still brand value in being present in the AIOs.</p>
          <p>In <a data-type="xref" href="#ch08_figure_2_1748358221779524">Figure 8-3</a>, we get an answer to our search question, but some users might ask a follow-up question about receiving a STEM degree, so being a reference follow-up link in the AIO might result in some traffic to your website. For example, a user might ask “where” or “how” to get a STEM degree. As an SEO practitioner, you might bring traffic from these queries. Ideally, your organization would be in the reference links where potential students could get more information about STEM degrees.</p>
          <p>To be more competitive with GEO, you’ll need to take a slightly different approach to <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content optimization" id="id831"/>content optimization than you have with SEO, which includes:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Authoritative citations</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Using links to authoritative resources is a common SEO strategy, but working with academic journals, government resources, or large, trusted news publications will boost your credibility and potential GEO visibility.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Statistics and useful data</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Many queries return numerical data to the search users. Adding your own authoritative information in the form of statistics, data from your studies and research, or numerical information that answers a query increases your authoritative signals.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Direct answers to the query </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>AIOs rely on ingested information from pages that answer questions or can formulate an answer to a question. Make sure your content directly answers the question a user asks a search engine. You can obtain questions from third-party tools like Semrush or Ahrefs.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Authoritative content</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>In addition to answering the question directly, your content must also address closely related background and questions that users are likely to be interested in.</p>
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>Success from GEO strategies also differs from traditional SEO metrics. Instead of focusing on clicks and visitors, GEO focuses on impressions based on your organization being included in SGE results. Generally, SEO content focuses on being authoritative and digestible by a broad audience, but GEO content must be much more specific at targeting a search query. Keywords can still be integrated into GEO-targeted content, but they must be embedded into contextual answers to search queries with statistical information and authoritative citations to back up your research.</p>
          <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
            <p>In GEO, we don’t think about ranking for keywords, but instead we think about how comprehensive we are in covering the topic and subtopics related to user needs. Nonetheless, keyword research can still provide us insight into what areas are of interest to users.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Some elements of SEO can carry over to GEO. For example, media elements are still relevant, but they should be highly authoritative. Infographics that AI crawlers can ingest and interpret can be easy for users to read quickly and better understand the topic, but they can also be used in AIO content. Designing your content to address user intent is still important. If your content is weak in addressing this intent, that will decrease user satisfaction with your site and harm both your SEO and GEO efforts. GEO will search for relevant content that answers the user’s query and filter out irrelevant, spammy, or poor-quality content.</p>
          <p>Protecting your organization from content theft is an issue you need to consider. Most important is determining if you want all your content to be crawled. It’s common for SEO practitioners to work with a domain’s <em>robots.txt</em> file<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="robots.txt files" id="id832"/> to block certain bots from crawling and indexing parts of site content. For example, you might have a low-quality page that you want to block from being indexed for quality-signal purposes. The same will be true for GEO crawlers. You might need to block some AI bots, but you should enable them from the major generative AI tools covered in this book, as you do want visibility on those platforms.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="GEO (generative engine optimization)" data-startref="geo" id="id833"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SEO (search engine optimization)" data-secondary="GEO (generative engine optimization) versus" data-startref="seo-geo" id="id834"/></p>
          <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
            <p>Not every bot will honor <em>robots.txt</em>, so SEO practitioners should monitor visitor statistics for malicious AI crawlers in addition to monitoring for malicious bots.</p>

        <section data-type="sect2" class="pagebreak-before less_space" data-pdf-bookmark="The Influence of Query Intent"><div class="sect2" id="ch08_the_influence_of_query_intent_1748358221787812">
          <h2>The Influence of Query Intent</h2>
          <p>Google is<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="query intent" id="query-intent-ch8"/> a business like any other, so it can be expected to change its methodologies based on the expectations and desires of its users. If users are happy with AI-generated results, then SEO professionals should expect Google to work with AI to create snippets at the top answering customer queries. </p>
          <p>Using AI-generated answers isn’t always beneficial, though. Again, it depends on the nature of the query. As an example, suppose a user asks Google to display the “best vacuum cleaner.” The “best” vacuum cleaner is subjective, and AI is not valuable for opinions (people generally want the opinions of experts or other people who have used the product). Having a short snippet at the top of search results isn’t beneficial for users in this scenario either because they likely want to see real human reviews and need to decide on purchasing the best appliance. Shopping and ecommerce SEO professionals will still find themselves working to rank their sites in these types of traditional search results as AIOs will have less of a presence. That said, Google is likely going to value human-generated content for these types of queries, such as Reddit, review sites (<a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://www.trustpilot.com"><em>Trustpilot.com</em></a>, <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com"><em>ConsumerAffairs.com</em></a>, and others), or other forums, and SEO practitioners will have to address those types of sites ranking higher—and potentially AI summarizing those results in the future.</p>
          <p>The way Google handles search experience will depend on searcher intent, whether it’s to make a purchase or to find information. Evergreen content will likely find itself below AIOs or other search snippets generated by AI at the top of the Google results. SEO practitioners can still try to get their own sites linked within these snippets, but it will be much more competitive, with the possibility of only one to three sources listed in them. In addition, traditional search results will be pushed below the fold and have less value than they do today.</p>
          <p class="pagebreak-after">Instead of manual execution of a search query, AI could be used to predict what searchers want on their<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="smartphones" id="id835"/> smartphones. For example, suppose you always look for presents for your child on your smartphone. Generative AI could ingest common search queries you use and predict that you need to buy a present year to year. It could even give suggestions before you perform a query. Google would need to adapt to include its service in this type of situation, where its search shows a list of items you could buy for your child’s birthday. In this scenario, an SEO practitioner would want to ensure that their store is in the list of possible options for users to view <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="query intent" data-startref="query-intent-ch8" id="id836"/>and buy.</p>

          <h2>The Impact of Generative AI on Business Models</h2>
          <p>There are<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="business models, impact of generative AI on" id="id837"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="generative AI" data-secondary="impact on business models" id="id838"/> other ways the SEO industry will change. Some of these changes could severely affect business models. For businesses that are negatively impacted by generative AI results, their owners and SEO staff must find new ways to attract users to their products and services. </p>
          <p>Some changes have already affected popular brands around the web. One example is<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Chegg" id="id839"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-secondary="Chegg versus" id="id840"/> Chegg, one of the best-known educational content providers. Chegg provides answers to quiz and test questions for students. In 2021, <a href="https://oreil.ly/QVp5l">it had a database of 46 million answers to various student questions and a $12 billion market cap</a>. Students could send in questions and hope that Chegg’s database had answers to these questions. Since the introduction of ChatGPT, students are instead turning to ChatGPT to get answers to their questions. ChatGPT provides answers based on a vast array of much of the world’s information, while Chegg has answers to only 46 million questions, a small percentage of the world’s information. <a href="https://oreil.ly/_hOdA">Semrush data</a><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Semrush" data-secondary="Chegg study" id="id841"/> suggests that Chegg has lost more than one-third of its organic search traffic, and the company’s market cap lost more than 80% of its value between February 2024 and February 2025.</p>
          <p>Another example <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dictionary websites" id="id842"/>of how generative AI affects site business is any dictionary site. As you may know, users go to dictionary sites for answers to word definitions, synonyms, and antonyms. For a while now, Google has displayed the definition of a word directly on the SERP. Users no longer need to go to any dictionary site to find answers, but the definitions displayed by generative AI come from these dictionary sites. Getting your organization’s pages into Google’s generative AI answers will be critical for SEO professionals but very challenging, with numerous competitors vying for the same positions. Should you get your brand into the generative AI results, your page will be referenced. Users then can click the reference link to see more information directly on your site.</p>
          <p class="pagebreak-after">While generative AI search will undoubtedly introduce a shift in how we drive traffic to our sites, it is unlikely to completely replace search engines or our current SEO strategies.

        <h1>Introduction of ChatGPT Search</h1>
        <p>In <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SEO (search engine optimization)" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="ChatGPT Search" id="seo-future-chatgpt-search"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="future of generative AI and SEO" data-secondary="ChatGPT Search" id="future-chatgpt-search"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ChatGPT Search" id="chatgpt-search"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="OpenAI" data-secondary="ChatGPT Search" id="openai-chatgpt-search"/>October 2024, OpenAI released its own search engine called ChatGPT Search. The search engine is still in its infancy, but it could become good competition for current search engines, mainly Google with its dominant market share. It appears that OpenAI is trying to break into the search engine market initially using a Chrome extension, and ChatGPT Search can also be integrated into Microsoft Teams.</p>
        <p>Right now, if users want to find a product, they first need to know the product or attributes of the product. Users can ask Google questions, but they need to get close to understanding what they are searching for. One difficult aspect of SEO is covering content and sales for any search query possible that can create visibility in search for potential customers. The OpenAI search eliminates the need to cover search queries. Instead, SEO professionals need to find ways to get their products shown in ChatGPT Search.</p>
        <p>Let’s say your client sells cars. An SEO practitioner must create a content strategy to cover as many search queries as possible that users might use when searching for a product or service like what your organization offers. For example, some potential customers could be looking for eco-friendly cars, another group of people might be searching for cars that are best for long-distance commutes, and others might be looking for sports cars. The current goal of SEO is to show up in Google search results for various search queries. Ideally, SEO practitioners strive to appear in the first three results, or at least on the first page. Not every search query has the same search volume and intent, but SEO aims to drive traffic to your employer’s site to then sell its product.</p>
        <p>With the OpenAI search, people can now ask questions about the type of car they’re interested in, and the LLM provides a list of suggestions. Google’s search results are vastly different. Right now, Google doesn’t give you a list of links to cars. Instead, it gives you links to discussions where people talk about cars. Let’s look at the query “I’m looking for a car that’s good for California driving and off-road trails” for both Google and OpenAI. First, let’s look at the initial links in Google’s search results, shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch08_figure_3_1748358221779556">Figure 8-4</a>.</p>
        <p>In <a data-type="xref" href="#ch08_figure_3_1748358221779556">Figure 8-4</a>, you can see that some of the results are based on discussions or reviews provided by third-party sites. The results don’t provide direct suggestions for car manufacturers or models, so users must click links and read more to figure out the best car for what they want.</p>

        <p class="pagebreak-before">In contrast, OpenAI search gives direct suggestions for car manufacturers and models, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch08_figure_4_1748358221779584">Figure 8-5</a>.</p>

        <h1>Progression of Generative AI Technology</h1>
        <p>In December 2023, <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SEO (search engine optimization)" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="DeepSeek" id="seo-future-deepseek"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="future of generative AI and SEO" data-secondary="DeepSeek" id="future-deepseek"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="DeepSeek" id="deepseek"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cost" data-secondary="of DeepSeek" data-secondary-sortas="DeepSeek" id="cost-deepseek"/>DeepSeek was released to the public. The new Chinese models are open source—meaning the parameters for models are made publicly available (also known as <em>open</em><em> </em><em>weight</em>)—and DeepSeek is seen as a significant competitor to OpenAI. A major feature of DeepSeek that attracts users is its <a href="https://oreil.ly/pGggM">user price</a>. Users pay about $3 for one million tokens, which give you about 80,000 words. Compare this cost to $15 on OpenAI for the same number of tokens. This inexpensive alternative to OpenAI could mean more users flocking to DeepSeek instead of using OpenAI. Cheaper generative AI could attract more users to content creation and other SEO benefits at a much greater scale at a lower cost. The lower cost also gives smaller businesses the opportunity to leverage generative AI.</p>
        <p>DeepSeek is a lower-cost LLM option, so it’s likely that others will find ways to reduce the costs of training these models. Cheaper costs benefit SEO practitioners who might not work for an organization with high-end marketing budgets, which brings more competition to the industry. You should expect to see many other new LLMs emerge over time. These will give SEO practitioners more options and add competition to the market. Even with other LLMs in the market, SEO will not be eliminated. Some of the work will now focus on GEO and become more competitive for <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SEO (search engine optimization)" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="DeepSeek" data-startref="seo-future-deepseek" id="id852"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="future of generative AI and SEO" data-secondary="DeepSeek" data-startref="future-deepseek" id="id853"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="DeepSeek" data-startref="deepseek" id="id854"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cost" data-secondary="of DeepSeek" data-secondary-sortas="DeepSeek" data-startref="cost-deepseek" id="id855"/>brands.</p>

        <h1>Conclusion: Preparing for the Future of Generative AI and SEO</h1>
        <p>Although generative AI is rapidly advancing, it falls short of consistently producing complete and accurate humanlike output. Images, videos, and text often have elements that give them away as being created by a bot. Although sometimes the signs are subtle, as people become more familiar with AI-generated content, their ability to discern it will grow. </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, generative AI will continue to evolve, and we can expect significant improvements in its ability to create more humanlike output. It might take many years to get there, but generative AI is still at the beginning stages of its evolution. While it might seem like generative AI cannot replace human-made art or writing, it will improve. In years to come, it will be less and less distinguishable from human-made content. Automation using generative AI will make SEO tasks more efficient, and some jobs traditionally done by humans might go away. SEO practitioners will need to “skill up” and find ways to work with new search engine strategies: strategies that include focusing more on the AI snippets at the top and less on displaying links to users. </p>
        <p>DeepSeek and other innovative generative AI technology have already reduced the number of “hallucinations” when models don’t have the right answers. Instead of relying on human researchers, generative AI can work with thousands of academic journals and sources to produce more accurate answers. The benefits will continue to grow, and generative AI will become an important asset for critical industries like health care. For example, doctors could get <span class="keep-together">information</span> about treatments based on symptoms to help them better treat their patients. It’s likely that many other industries will leverage generative AI to speed up productivity and provide a better quality of life.</p>
        <p>Improvements to generative AI are already in process, but raising the quality of AI output will take time. It may not happen next year or the year after, but it will within a few years and over the next decade. The generative AI you know today will be vastly different and more accurate in 10 years. For SEO practitioners to keep pace with generative AI, they need to continually experiment with changes, adapt their strategies, and work with AI models that produce output for their brand. If you aren’t using or planning to use the advanced technologies discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06_advanced_use_cases_for_generative_ai_in_seo_1748359259642070">Chapter 6</a>, then you risk being left behind.</p>
        <p>Staying at the forefront of SEO in the age of AI requires experimentation. When you find an SEO strategy that works, continue to refine it. As AI technology advances, your SEO strategies must keep pace to ensure continued relevance and success for your organization.</p>
