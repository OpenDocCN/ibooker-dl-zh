- en: Deep learning has emerged in the last few years as a premier technology for
    building intelligent systems that learn from data. Deep neural networks, originally
    roughly inspired by how the human brain learns, are trained with large amounts
    of data to solve complex tasks with unprecedented accuracy. With open source frameworks
    making this technology widely available, it is becoming a must-know for anybody
    involved with big data and machine learning.

- en: TensorFlow is currently the leading open source software for deep learning,
    used by a rapidly growing number of practitioners working on computer vision,
    natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and general predictive
    analytics.

- en: This book is an end-to-end guide to TensorFlow designed for data scientists,
    engineers, students, and researchers. The book adopts a hands-on approach suitable
    for a broad technical audience, allowing beginners a gentle start while diving
    deep into advanced topics and showing how to build production-ready systems.
