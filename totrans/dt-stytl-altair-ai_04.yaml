    the basic concepts behind generative AI tools and how to use them in the context
    of data storytelling. The chapter does not describe the fundamentals of generative
    AI. Instead, the first part gives a quick overview of AI, generative AI, and generative
    AI tools. Next, the chapter describes how to incorporate three main tools into
    data storytelling: ChatGPT, DALL-E, and GitHub Copilot. Finally, it shows a practical
    use case, which demonstrates how you can combine the three tools to build data

    (*Considerazioni sulla tecnologia GPT*, 2023, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So48YMYyl58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So48YMYyl58)),
    where panelists discussed the (possible) benefits introduced by generative AI.
    During the discussion, one particular intervention by Dr. Michele Monti caught
    my attention. He drew an interesting analogy between using ChatGPT to assist you
    while writing and using a satellite navigator on a smartphone to assist you while
    going to a destination.
  prefs: []

    relied on paper maps to reach a destination, with the notable difference that
    a paper map doesn’t need any infrastructure or energy to be operational. However,
    with the advent of satellite navigators, the convenience and efficiency they offered
    made paper maps almost obsolete. Nowadays, very few people would consider using
    a paper map when they have the option of using a satellite navigator.

    Before the emergence of generative AI tools, one needed to write texts manually.
    This could be time consuming and labor intensive. As generative AI advances, it
    may increasingly become the primary mode of assistance when writing and generating
    images, although one should never become totally dependent on it.

    storytelling with Altair and the DIKW pyramid. It was my editor (whom I sincerely
    thank), in light of the rapid emergence of generative AI at the time of writing,
    who suggested also including generative AI. At first, I only thought about Copilot,
    but then, as I wrote the examples, I made more and more use of other newly available
    generative AI tools to complete the data stories. And that’s why I decided to
    also describe in the book how to do data storytelling using generative AI tools.

    DALL-E. The real reason is that to apply the generative AI tools correctly, it
    is necessary first to understand the context in which you work. If I had immediately
    introduced ChatGPT and DALL-E, I would have risked readers delegating everything
    to these tools without building a solid foundation. Knowledge of how to do data
    storytelling in Python would inevitably be superficial. Imagine the concepts described
    in this book as a house where the foundations are data storytelling concepts,
    the floors are Altair, and the roof and walls are generative AI. Just as you cannot
    build a house from the roof and the walls, you cannot start immediately with generative
    AI. However, to not leave you hungry for generative AI in the first chapters,
    I still wanted to mention GitHub Copilot because, as they say, appetite comes
    with eating.

    generative AI tools as assistants in developing our ideas. Before seeing how to

    the concept of generative AI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of AI; more precisely,
    it is a subfield of deep learning. Describing the foundations of generative AI
    is out of the scope of this book, but a quick overview of it is mandatory to understand
    the general context before we delve into its use. At the time of writing this
    book, there was a lot of debate surrounding the use of generative AI tools. On
    the one hand, some people argue that these tools are dangerous, as they could
    potentially replace human jobs, leading to widespread unemployment. Additionally,
    they often produce hazardous, biased, and hallucinated results, among other issues.
    There are worries about the ethical implications of AI decision making, as well
    as the potential misuse or manipulation of these tools for malicious purposes.
    On the other hand, other people highlight their benefits, recognizing the level
    of automation introduced by these tools under the supervision of a responsible
    user. In this book, I do not take a position, leaving for you the responsibility
    to use these tools consciously.

    generative AI tools. We will use them as assistants that help us better define
    our content but which will never replace our supervision and ideas. By “conservative
    and responsible attitude,” we mean that we will not use the output produced by
    generative AI tools as the absolute truth. Instead, we will adopt the human-in-the-loop
    strategy, by always checking the produced output.

    the case of assessing whether an outfit is fashionable or not. Without ML, you
    would have to code every line description. Instead, using ML will require collecting
    and labeling a substantial dataset of outfit descriptions and fashion elements.
    Then, you will use it to train an ML model to recognize whether the outfit is
    fashionable or not. Different from traditional programming, where you must write
    the code line by line to provide instructions, ML allows machines to learn from
    data and make predictions or take actions based on that learned information. This
    approach empowers machines to discover patterns, relationships, and insights that
    may not be immediately apparent to human programmers. ML relies on different types
    of learning. The most popular are supervised learning and unsupervised learning.'

    within the labeled data, input features must be extracted. Input features represent
    the distinct attributes of the data that the model will analyze to learn patterns
    and relationships. In supervised learning, there is a preliminary phase, called
    *training*, during which algorithms learn from labeled data. During training,
    each sample in the training dataset is paired with its corresponding label or
    output. The algorithm learns how to map input features to their respective outputs
    by generalizing from the provided labeled data. During the training phase, the
    algorithm optimizes its parameters to minimize discrepancies between the predicted
    outputs and the true labels. Once the training phase is completed, the algorithm
    can make predictions or classify new, unseen instances based on the patterns it
    has learned from the labeled data. Use this technique for tasks such as image
    classification, sentiment analysis, spam detection, and speech recognition.'

    the algorithm predicts which category or class it belongs to. The classes are

    spam or not spam) and image recognition (identifying objects like cats or dogs
    in images).'

    of predicting a class label, regression algorithms predict a quantity. For example,

    classes.'

- en: In general, when we want to compare two variables across multiple categories,
    it can be useful to calculate the percentage difference or the percentage increase
    of one variable relative to the other for each category and then show it. This
    approach allows us to compare the two variables and identify any patterns or trends
    within the data. To generate this type of chart, we can once again make use of
    Copilot, which can assist us in writing the necessary code. Write the list of
    instructions specified in the following listing. The instructions in bold show
    what changes from listing 4.7.

    the `Y` scale to `[0,100]` to make the chart clearer. Since the chart is more
    complex than the previous one, add the instruction `with` `the` `following` `encodings`
    when you ask Copilot to draw the chart. Do the same thing for mark properties.
    Also, note the nested lists to add specific property values to encoding channels.

    between the Our Best Time and the Record Time are Swimming and Long-Distance Running.
    However, the chart may be misleading because it is not intuitive, since the largest
    bars are, in fact, the worst performers. To improve the readability and intuitiveness
    of the chart and better convey the actual performance of athletes in each sport,
    we can calculate the percentage improvement.

    of Our Best Time compared to the Record Time. A higher percentage improvement
    indicates that the athlete’s performance is closer to or better than the record
    holder’s, while a smaller percentage improvement indicates that the athlete’s
    performance is further from the record holder’s performance. This is more intuitive,
    as the larger bars now indicate the best performance. Figure 4.19 shows the percentage
    improvement. Rowing and cycling are the sports with better performances; thus,
    you can choose those sports for further investment.
