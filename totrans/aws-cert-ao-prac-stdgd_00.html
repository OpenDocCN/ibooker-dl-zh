<h1>Foreword</h1>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative technologies of our lifetime. For more than 25 years, Amazon has invested in the development of AI and machine learning (ML) because we believe these technologies have the power to transform the lives of our customers and communities.</p>

<p>With the rise of generative AI, we’re seeing more organizations adopt AI services to drive innovation and unlock extraordinary capabilities. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI Ready initiative (Amazon)" data-secondary="shortage of talent" id="id352"/>But while AI makes innovation possible, it’s people who make it happen. This human element is precisely why organizations are actively seeking AI talent. <a href="https://oreil.ly/0g7Ww">Our research</a> shows 92% of organizations have plans to hire people with AI skills to help them drive AI innovations. While this is welcome news, there’s currently a global AI talent shortage. <a href="https://oreil.ly/2rPhg">Three out of four employers</a> consider hiring AI-skilled talent a priority but can’t find the AI talent they need.</p>

<p>That’s why in 2023, we made a <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI Ready initiative (Amazon)" id="id353"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon AI Ready initiative" id="id354"/>commitment to provide free AI skills training for two million people worldwide by 2025 as part of Amazon’s AI Ready initiative. Through this commitment, learners are applying their knowledge to their jobs to help them become more productive and creative, showcasing their skills to prospective employers to help them become more competitive candidates, or pursuing further training to build a career in AI.</p>

<p>We reached our AI Ready goal a year ahead of schedule, but it’s just the beginning. We’ll continue helping more people upskill in AI because AI skills have become essential to the modern workforce. Organizations and people who invest in AI skills training are better equipped to keep pace with the rapid advancements in this area and thrive in an era of unprecedented technological change.</p>

<p>I’m thrilled you’re embarking on the AI upskilling journey by pursuing the AWS Certified AI Practitioner. Tom’s book is an excellent resource to help you prepare for the exam in addition to the exam prep that AWS offers. It’s a thorough guide that covers the basics of AWS, AWS AI, and ML services and tools; responsible AI; strategies to help pass the exam; and so much more.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I’ve acquired new skills at each stage to deliver value to the organizations I’ve been fortunate to work with. I’m a firm believer that curiosity and a commitment to lifelong learning will also be the key to advancing your career. Whether this is your first certification or one of many in your toolbox, you’re demonstrating these values that will prepare you for an AI-driven future. Your investment in AI upskilling will not only empower you to build an enduring and meaningful career for yourself but also unlock exciting innovations that will benefit future generations.</p>
