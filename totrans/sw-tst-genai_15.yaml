- en: The process of getting set up with ChatGPT is relatively simple. First, we create
    an account with OpenAI, which can be done via the login and registration page,
    available at [https://chat.openai.com/auth/login](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login).
    From there, we create our account, focusing on registering for a free account
    for now.

- en: It’s likely that ChatGPT Plus will be upsold during the registration process.
    At the time of writing, ChatGPT Plus costs $20 a month and grants you access to
    the latest version of ChatGPT (as opposed to the free version that uses gpt-3.5-turbo)
    along with a collection of plugins and other new features that extend the core
    prompting features of ChatGPT. We don’t use Plus in this book, but the activities
    and examples can be used both on Plus and the free account. However, how ChatGPT
    responds will likely differ when using Plus.

    to be presented with the ChatGPT home page, where we can begin to send prompts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To use ChatGPT, we need to provide it with instructions, or prompts, that we
    enter into the form at the bottom of the page titled Send a Message, as shown
    in figure A.1.

    will be added to the history bar on the left, and ChatGPT will respond as in the
    example shown in figure A.2.

    be considered. For example, in figure A.3, we can see how ChatGPT takes the first
    prompt about the capital of the United Kingdom into account when responding to
    the second prompt that asks about city size.

- en: A more advanced feature that is available for Free and Plus licenses is the
    use of custom instructions. These can be used to customize how ChatGPT responds
    to prompts by adding our instructions to each prompt we send. To access the instructions,
    we click our avatar in the top-right corner and select Customize ChatGPT to be
    presented with a pop-up like the one captured in figure A.6.

    that when ChatGPT is prompted to respond with code examples, it does so in Java
    rather than in Python, which it tends to default to. To do this, we add the following
    instruction to the section “How would you like ChatGPT to respond?”:'
