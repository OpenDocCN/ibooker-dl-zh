<p>Search ranking shouldn’t be a static function. Every query and user interaction with search results is a signal that can be used to improve the relevance of future results. In the last part, we learned domain-specific knowledge from content and signals, and we used that knowledge to interpret query intent.</p>

<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p3">
<p>In this part, we’ll take a deeper dive into the topic of reflected intelligence, the process of learning from user interactions with search results to improve relevance ranking models. We’ll extend our coverage of crowdsourced relevance algorithms from chapter 4, with chapters dedicated to three key types of reflected intelligence: popularized relevance (signals boosting), personalized relevance (collaborative filtering), and generalized relevance (learning to rank).</p>

<p>Chapter 8 covers various approaches to signals boosting to better rank your most popular queries. Chapter 9 then leverages signals to build more personalized relevance ranking, catering to your users’ specific interests based on their behavior. Chapter 10 begins a three-chapter journey into the world of machine-learned ranking, also known as “learning to rank”. In chapter 10, you’ll learn how to build a ranking classifier model from relevance judgments and how to deploy that model as a generalized relevance ranking algorithm. Chapter 11 introduces click models—leveraging user search and click signals to learn implicit relevance judgments—and it uses them to automate the process of learning to rank. Finally, chapter 12 introduces active learning and A/B testing approaches to overcome biases in those implicitly trained models by intelligently exploring previously unseen results and gathering live user feedback.</p>
