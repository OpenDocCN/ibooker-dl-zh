    in a ring shape. It is similar to the pie chart but with a hole in the center,
    creating a visual representation of proportions or percentages of different categories.

    shown in figure C.4\. Copilot will suggest how to complete the sentence. Press

    You can add a comment at any point of your code and ask Copilot to generate new
    code for you! Since Copilot is a generative AI tool, it may happen that, in your

    the x-axis representing the different categories or periods and the y-axis representing
    the values of the data. In other words, a slope chart is a line chart with just
    two points. The following listing shows how to build a slope chart.'

    by a line, one at the beginning and one at the end. Dumbbell charts are similar
    to slope charts, but usually, we use dumbbell charts to compare the difference
    between two data points. In contrast, we use slope charts to compare changes in
    data over time or between different groups.'

    and for others we didn’t directly specify prompts; however, in all cases, Copilot
    assisted us while writing the code by suggesting new code while writing it.

    in the late eighteenth century. In addition to inventing the line chart, Playfair
    also introduced other popular data visualizations, such as bar charts and pie
    charts. His innovative use of graphical representations revolutionized the way
    we present data today, making him a pioneer in the field of data visualization.****  ****#
