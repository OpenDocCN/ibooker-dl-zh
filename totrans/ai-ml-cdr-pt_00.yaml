- en: AI is poised to transform every industry, but almost every AI application needs
    to be customized for its particular use. A system for reading medical records
    is different from one for finding defects in a factory, which is different from
    a product recommendation engine. For AI to reach its full potential, engineers
    need tools that can help them adapt to the amazing capabilities available to the
    millions of concrete problems we wish to solve.

- en: When I led the Google Brain team, we started to build a C++ framework for deep
    learning called DistBelief. We were excited about the potential of harnessing
    thousands of CPUs to train a neural network (for instance, using 16,000 CPUs to
    train a cat detector on unlabeled YouTube videos). How far deep learning has come
    since then! What was once cutting-edge can now be done on your laptop! And you’ll
    learn how to, with PyTorch, in this book. Frameworks for creating ML models to
    implement AI have come a long way, too.

- en: PyTorch has made significant progress. It is designed to be easy to learn as
    well as powerful enough to be used by researchers. Its rich features can help
    one build a wide range of AI tools, from simple models, to transfer learning from
    others, to fine tuning the most modern generative AI models.

    AI in TensorFlow and PyTorch. I have been privileged to work together with him
    in teaching several specializations with deeplearning.ai and Coursera, including
    an upcoming one on PyTorch.

    these lines. But in this post-Transformer network age, we can create far more
    sophisticated content—from poetry, to code, to analysis of documents! In this
    book, he covers both and helps you be prepared for modern AI.

    involved? You can 1) work on exciting projects that move humanity forward, 2)
    advance your career, and 3) get free Irish poetry. I wish you the best in your
    journey learning PyTorch.
