    that’s designed to make it easier to use Transformers.

    this process, you can see how, step by step, you can fine-tune an existing LLM
    on new data to turn it into a classification engine! In many circumstances, this
    may be overkill (and training your own model instead of fine-tuning an LLM may
    be quicker and cheaper), but it’s certainly worth evaluating this process. Sometimes,
    even untuned LLMs will work well for classification! In my experience, using the
    general artificial-understanding nature of LLMs will lead to the creation of far
    more effective classifiers with stronger results.` ``  [PRE18]`# Prompt-Tuning
    an LLM    A lightweight alternative to fine-tuning is *prompt tuning,* in which
    you can adapt a model to specific tasks. With prompt tuning, you do this by prepending
    trainable *soft prompts* to each input instead of modifying the model weights.
    These soft prompts will then be optimized during training.    These soft prompts
    are like learned instructions that guide the model’s behavior. Unlike discrete
    text prompts (such as `Classify the sentiment`), the idea of soft prompts is that
    they exist in the model’s embedding space as continuous vectors. So, for example,
    when processing “This movie was great,” the model would see “[V1][V2]…[V20]This
    movie was great.” In this case, [V1][V2]...[V20] are vectors that will help steer
    the model toward the desired classification.    Ultimately, the advantage here
    is efficiency. So instead of fine-tuning a model, amending its weights for each
    task, and saving the entire model for reuse, you only need to save the soft prompt
    vectors. These are much smaller, and they can help you have a suite of fine-tunes
    that you can easily use to guide the model to a specific task without needing
    to manage multiple models.    Prompt tuning like this can actually match or exceed
    the performance of full fine-tuning, particularly with larger models, and it’s
    significantly more efficient.    Now, let’s explore how to prompt-tune the BART
    LLM with the IMDb dataset in direct comparison to the fine-tuning earlier in this
    chapter.    ## Preparing the Data    Let’s start by preparing our data, loading
    it from the IMDb dataset, and setting up the virtual tokens. Here’s the code you’ll
    need:    [PRE19]    This will also tokenize our incoming examples so you should
    note that the maximum length of any example will now be reduced by the number
    of virtual tokens. So, for example, with BERT, we have a maximum length of 512,
    but if we’re going to have 20 virtual tokens, then the sequence maximum length
    will now be 492.    We’ll now load a subset of the data and try with 5,000 examples,
    instead of 25,000\. You can experiment with this number and trade off smaller
    amounts for faster training against larger amounts for better accuracy.    First,
    we’ll create the indices that we want to take from the dataset for training, and
    we’ll test them. Think of these as pointers to the records we’re interested in.
    We’re randomly sampling here:    [PRE20]    Then, the last two lines define the
    mapping function, which simply takes the values from the dataset we’re interested
    in and tokenizes them. We’ll see that in the next step.    ## Creating the Data
    Loaders    Now that we have sets of tokenized training and test data, we want
    to turn them into data loaders. We’ll do this by first selecting the raw examples
    from the underlying data that match the content in our indices:    [PRE21]    Then,
    we’ll set the format of the data that we’re interested in. There may be many columns
    in a dataset, but you won’t use them all for training. In this case, we’ll want
    the `input_ids`, which are the tokenized versions of our input content; the `attention_mask`,
    which is a set of vectors that tells us which tokens in the `input_ids` we should
    be interested in (this has the effect of filtering out padding or other nonsemantic
    tokens); and the label:    [PRE22]    Now, we can specify the DataLoader that
    takes these training and test sets. I have a large batch size here because I was
    testing on a 40Gb GRAM GPU in Colab. In your environment, you may need to adjust
    these:    [PRE23]    Now that the data is processed and loaded into DataLoaders,
    we can go to the next step: defining the model.    ## Defining the Model    First,
    let’s see how to instantiate the model, and then we can go back to the raw definition.
    Typically, in our code, once we’ve set up our DataLoaders, we’ll want to create
    an instance of the model. We’ll use code like this:    [PRE24]    This keeps it
    nice and simple, and we’ll encapsulate the underlying BERT in an override for
    a prompt-tuning version. Now, as nice as it would be for transformers to have
    one, they don’t, so we need to create this class for ourselves.    As we would
    with any PyTorch class that defines a model, we’ll create it with an `__init__`
    method to set it up and a forward method that PyTorch’s training loop will call
    during the forward pass. So, let’s start with the `__init__` method and the class
    definition:    [PRE25]    There’s a lot going on here, so let’s break it down
    little by little. First of all, I set the defaults for the `num_virtual_tokens`
    to 50 and the `max_length` default to 512\. If you don’t specify your own defaults
    when you instantiate the class, you’ll get these values. In this case, the calling
    code sets them to 20 and 512, respectively, but you’re free to experiment.    Next,
    the code sets up the transformers `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` class to
    get BERT:    [PRE26]    As with fine-tuning for IMDb, we’re interested in training
    the model to recognize two labels, so they’re set up here. However, one difference
    from fine-tuning is that we’re not going to change any of the weights within the
    BERT model itself, so we set that we don’t want gradients and freeze it like this:    [PRE27]    The
    secret sauce in generating the soft prompts that we’re going to use comes at the
    end of the init. We’ll create a vector to contain our number of virtual tokens,
    and I just initialized it with random tokens from the vocabulary. There are smarter
    things that we might do here to make training more efficient over time, but for
    the sake of simplicity, let’s go with this:    [PRE28]    The pretrained BERT
    model in transformers comes with embeddings, so we can use them to turn our list
    of random tokens into embeddings:    [PRE29]    Importantly, we should now specify
    that the `prompt_embeddings` are parameters of the neural network. This will be
    important later, when we define the optimizer. We recently specified that all
    of the BERT parameters were frozen, but *these* parameters are not part of that
    and thus are not frozen, so they will be tweaked by the optimizer during training:    [PRE30]    We
    have now initialized a subclassed version of the tunable BERT, specified that
    we don’t want to amend its gradients, and created a set of soft prompts that we
    will append to the examples as we’re training—and we’ll tweak only those soft
    prompts to soft-tune the two output neurons.    Now, let’s look at the `forward`
    function that will be called during the forward pass at training time. Given that
    we’ve set up everything, this is pretty straightforward:    [PRE31]    Let’s look
    at it step-by-step. During the forward pass in training, this function will be
    passed batches of data. Therefore, we need to understand what the size of this
    batch is and then extract the `input_ids` (the tokens for the values read from
    the dataset) and the attention mask for that particular ID:    [PRE32]    We’ll
    also need to convert the `input_ids` into embeddings:    [PRE33]    Our soft prompts
    are also tokenized sentences. Originally, they were initialized to random words,
    and we’ll see over time that they’ll adjust appropriately. But for this step,
    these tokens need to be converted to embeddings:    [PRE34]    The `expand` method
    just adds the batch size to the prompt embeddings. When we defined the class,
    we didn’t know how large each batch coming in would be (and the code is written
    to let you tweak that based on the size of your available memory), so using `expand(batch_size,
    –1, –1)` turns the vector of prompt embeddings, which was of shape `[1, num_prompt_tokens,
    embedding_dimensions]`, into `[batch_size, num_prompt_tokens, embedding_dimensions]`.    Our
    soft prompt tuning involved prepending the soft embeddings to the embeddings for
    the actual input data, so we do that with this:    [PRE35]    BERT uses an `attention_mask`
    to filter out the tokens we don’t want to worry about at training or inference
    time, which are usually the padding tokens. But we want BERT to pay attention
    to all of the soft prompt tokens, so we’ll set the attention mask for them to
    be all 1s and then append that to the incoming attention mask(s) for the training
    data. Here’s the code:    [PRE36]    Now that we’ve done all our tuning, we need
    to pass the data to the model to have it optimize and calculate the loss:    [PRE37]    We
    will see how this data is used in the training loop, next.    ## Training the
    Model    The key to this training is that we’re going to do a full, normal training
    loop but in a special circumstance. In this case, we previously froze *everything*
    in the BERT model, *except* for the soft prompts that we defined as model parameters.
    Therefore, say we define the optimizer like this:    [PRE38]    In this case,
    we’re using standard code, telling it to tweak the model’s parameters. But the
    only ones that are available to tune are the soft prompts, so this should be quick!    Note
    that the value for the learning rate is quite large. This helps the system learn
    quickly, but in a real system, you’d likely want the value to be smaller—or at
    least adjustable, starting large and then shrinking in later epochs.    So now,
    let’s get into training. First, we’ll set up the training loop:    [PRE39]    ###
    Managing data batches    For each batch, we’ll get the columns (`input_ids` and
    `attention_masks`) as well as the labels and pass them to the model:    [PRE40]    This
    looks a little different from ones earlier in this book, but it’s pretty much
    doing the same thing. The `tqdm` code just gives us a status bar because we’re
    training. We read the data batch by batch, but we want the data to be on the same
    device as the model. So, for example, if the model is running on a GPU, we want
    it to access data in the GPU’s memory. Therefore, this line will iterate through
    each column, reading the key and passing the value to the device:    [PRE41]    It
    redefines the batch that was read in to ensure that the data is on the same device
    as the model. But we don’t want the labels to be in the batch because the model
    expects them to be fed in separately, so we remove them from the batch with the
    `pop()` method:    [PRE42]    Now, we can use the shorthand of `**batch` to pass
    the set of input values (in this case, the `input_ids` and the `attention_mask`)
    to the forward method of the model and unpack the dictionary along with the labels,
    like this:    [PRE43]    ### Handling the loss    The forward pass sends the data
    to the model and gets the loss back. We use this to update our overall loss, and
    we can then backward pass:    [PRE44]    With the gradients flowing back, the
    optimizer can now do its job.    ### Optimizing for loss    Remembering that the
    `model.parameters()` will only manage the *trainable unfrozen* parameters, we
    can now call the optimizer. I added something called *gradient clipping* here
    to make the training a little more efficient, but the rest is just calling the
    optimizer’s next step and then zeroing out the gradients so we can use them next
    time:    [PRE45]    ###### Note    The idea behind *gradient clipping* is that
    sometimes, during backpropagation, the gradients can be too large and the optimizer
    might take very large steps. This can lead to a problem called *exploding gradients*,
    in which the value changes hide the nuances of what might be learned. But clipping
    scales the gradients down if their values grow too large, and in a situation like
    this one, they may not even be necessary.    ## Evaluation During Training    We
    also have a set of test data, so we can evaluate how the model performs during
    the training cycle. In each epoch, once the forward and backward passes are done
    and the model parameters are reset, we can switch the model into evaluation mode
    and then start passing all of the test data through it to get inference. We’ll
    also compare the results of the inference against the actual labels to calculate
    accuracy:    [PRE46]    Then, we’ll have similar code—but this time, it will be
    to read the eval batches, turn them into outputs with labels, and get predictions
    and loss values from the model:    [PRE47]    Once we’ve calculated these values,
    then at the end of each epoch, we can report on them and on training loss.    ##
    Reporting Training Metrics    During training in each epoch, we calculated the
    training loss, so we can now get the average across all records. We can do the
    same thing with the validation loss and (of course) with the validation accuracy
    and then report on them:    [PRE48]    Running this training for three epochs
    gives us this:    [PRE49]    This was done on an A100 in Colab with 40 Gb of GRAM,
    and as you can see, each epoch only took about 1 minute to train and 30 seconds
    to evaluate.    By the end, the average training loss had dropped from about 0.65
    to 0.58\. The accuracy was 0.8736\. So, it’s likely overfitting because we only
    trained for three epochs.    ## Saving the Prompt Embeddings    What’s really
    nice about this approach is that you can simply save out the prompt embeddings
    when you’re done. You can also load them back in for inference later, as you’ll
    see in the next section:    [PRE50]    What I find really cool about this is that
    this file is relatively small (61 K), and it doesn’t require you to amend the
    underlying model in any way. Thus, in an application, you could potentially have
    a number of these prompt-tuning files and hot-swap and replace them as needed
    so that you can have multiple models that you can orchestrate, which is the basis
    for an agentic solution.    ## Performing Inference with the Model    To perform
    inference with a prompt-tuned model, you’ll simply define the model with the soft
    prompts and then, instead of training them, load the pretrained soft prompts back
    from disk. We’ll explore that in this section. If you don’t want to train your
    own model, then [in the download](https://github.com/lmoroney/PyTorch-Book-FIles),
    I’ve provided soft prompts from a version of the model that was trained for 30
    epochs instead of 3.    For tidier encapsulation, I created a class that is similar
    to the one we used for training but that is just for inference. I call it `PromptTunedBERTInference`,
    and here’s its initializer:    [PRE51]    It’s very similar to the initializer
    for the trainable one, except for a couple of important points. The first is that
    because we’re *only* using it for inference, I’ve set it into eval mode:    [PRE52]    The
    second is that we don’t need to train the embeddings and do all the associated
    plumbing—instead, we just load them from the specified path:    [PRE53]    And
    that’s it! As you can see, it’s quite lightweight and pretty straightforward.
    It won’t have a `forward` function because we’re not training it, but let’s add
    a `predict` function that encapsulates doing inference with it.    ### The predict
    function    The job of the `predict` function is to take in the string(s) that
    we want to perform inference with, tokenize it (them), and then pass it to the
    model with the soft tokens prepended. Let’s take a look at the code, piece by
    piece.    First, let’s define it and have it accept text that it will then tokenize:    [PRE54]    The
    text will be tokenized up to the maximum length, less the size of the soft prompt,
    and then each of the items in the input will be loaded into a dictionary. Note
    that the tokenizer will return multiple columns for the text—usually, the tokens
    and the attention mask—so we’ll follow this approach to turn them into a set of
    key-value pairs that are easy for us to work with later.    Now that we have our
    inputs, it’s time to pass them to the model. We’ll start by putting `torch` into
    `no_grad()` mode because we’re not interested in training gradients. We’ll then
    get the embeddings for each of our tokens:    [PRE55]    We have an attention
    mask for the input that’s generated by the tokenizer, but we don’t have one for
    the soft prompt. So, let’s create one and then append it to the input attention
    mask:    [PRE56]    Now that we have everything in place, we can pass our data
    to the model to get our inferences back:    [PRE57]    The outputs will be the
    logits from the two neurons, one representing positive sentiment and the other
    negative. We can then Softmax these to get the prediction:    [PRE58]    ### Usage
    example    Using this class for a prediction is then pretty straightforward. We
    create an instance of the class and pass a string to it to get results. The results
    will contain a prediction and a confidence value, which we can then output:    [PRE59]    One
    note you might see with prompt tuning is low confidence values that can lead to
    mis-predictions, especially with binary classifiers like this one. It’s good to
    explore your inference to make sure that it’s working well, and there are also
    techniques that you could explore to ensure that the logits are giving the values
    you want. These include setting the temperature of the Softmax, using more prompt
    tokens to give the model more capacity, and initializing the prompt tokens with
    sentiment-related words (instead of random tokens, like we did here).    # Summary    In
    this chapter, we explored different methods for customizing LLMs with our own
    data. We looked at two main approaches: traditional fine-tuning and prompt tuning.    Using
    the IMDb dataset, you saw how to fine-tune BERT for sentiment analysis and walked
    through all the steps—from data preparation, to model configuration, to training
    and evaluation. The model achieved an impressive 95% accuracy in sentiment classification
    in just a few epochs.    However, fine-tuning may not be appropriate in all cases,
    and to that end, you explored a lightweight alternative called prompt tuning.
    Instead of modifying model weights, the idea here was to prepend trainable soft
    prompts to inputs, which are optimized during training. This approach provides
    significant advantages in that it can be much faster and it doesn’t change the
    underlying model. In this case, the tuned prompts could be saved (and they were
    only a few Kb) and then reloaded to program the model to perform the desired task.
    You then went through a full implementation, showing you how to create, train,
    and save these soft prompts, plus load them back to perform inference.    In the
    next chapter, we’ll explore how you can serve LLMs, including customized ones.
    I’ll explain how to do this in your own data center by using Ollama, which is
    a powerful tool for handling the serving and management of LLMs. You’ll learn
    how to take models and turn them into services, and we’ll also explore how to
    set up Ollama and use it over HTTP to talk with models in your data center.[PRE60]``'
