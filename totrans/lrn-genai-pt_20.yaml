- en: Various ways of installing Python and managing libraries and packages on your
    computer exist. This book uses Anaconda, an open-source Python distribution, package
    manager, and environment management tool. Anaconda stands out for its user-friendly
    nature and capacity to facilitate the effortless installation of numerous libraries
    and packages, which could be painful or downright impossible to install otherwise.

    install’ and ‘pip install,’ broadening the spectrum of available resources. This
    appendix will guide you to create a dedicated Python virtual environment for all
    projects in this book. This segmentation ensures that the libraries and packages
    used in this book remain isolated from any libraries utilized in other, unrelated
    projects, thus eliminating any potential interference.

    I will guide you through the installation of Jupyter Notebook in the Python virtual
    environment you just created. Finally, I will guide you through the process of
    installing PyTorch, Torchvision, and Torchaudio, based on whether your computer
    is equipped with a compute unified device architecture (CUDA)-enabled GPU.
