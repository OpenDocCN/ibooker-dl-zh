<p>We’ve finally gotten to the point: how to use ChatGPT and DALL-E to do data storytelling. You might wonder why you had to wait until now to see these tools in action. I will give you an answer during this chapter, in which we will review the basic concepts behind generative AI tools and how to use them in the context of data storytelling. The chapter does not describe the fundamentals of generative AI. Instead, the first part gives a quick overview of AI, generative AI, and generative AI tools. Next, the chapter describes how to incorporate three main tools into data storytelling: ChatGPT, DALL-E, and GitHub Copilot. Finally, it shows a practical use case, which demonstrates how you can combine the three tools to build data stories quickly.</p>

<h2 class="readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">4.1</span> Generative AI tools: On the giants’ shoulders</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p8">
<p>Some time ago, I participated in a webinar entitled <em>Considerations on GPT Technology</em> (<em>Considerazioni sulla tecnologia GPT</em>, 2023, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So48YMYyl58">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So48YMYyl58</a>), where panelists discussed the (possible) benefits introduced by generative AI. During the discussion, one particular intervention by Dr. Michele Monti caught my attention. He drew an interesting analogy between using ChatGPT to assist you while writing and using a satellite navigator on a smartphone to assist you while going to a destination.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p9">
<p>In the past, when satellite navigators were not readily available, travelers relied on paper maps to reach a destination, with the notable difference that a paper map doesn’t need any infrastructure or energy to be operational. However, with the advent of satellite navigators, the convenience and efficiency they offered made paper maps almost obsolete. Nowadays, very few people would consider using a paper map when they have the option of using a satellite navigator.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p10">
<p>A similar analysis could be made of generative AI tools, especially ChatGPT. Before the emergence of generative AI tools, one needed to write texts manually. This could be time consuming and labor intensive. As generative AI advances, it may increasingly become the primary mode of assistance when writing and generating images, although one should never become totally dependent on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p11">
<p>In my original idea, this book was only supposed to describe how to do data storytelling with Altair and the DIKW pyramid. It was my editor (whom I sincerely thank), in light of the rapid emergence of generative AI at the time of writing, who suggested also including generative AI. At first, I only thought about Copilot, but then, as I wrote the examples, I made more and more use of other newly available generative AI tools to complete the data stories. And that’s why I decided to also describe in the book how to do data storytelling using generative AI tools. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p12">
<p>You might wonder why you had to wait until chapter 4 to read about ChatGPT and DALL-E. The real reason is that to apply the generative AI tools correctly, it is necessary first to understand the context in which you work. If I had immediately introduced ChatGPT and DALL-E, I would have risked readers delegating everything to these tools without building a solid foundation. Knowledge of how to do data storytelling in Python would inevitably be superficial. Imagine the concepts described in this book as a house where the foundations are data storytelling concepts, the floors are Altair, and the roof and walls are generative AI. Just as you cannot build a house from the roof and the walls, you cannot start immediately with generative AI. However, to not leave you hungry for generative AI in the first chapters, I still wanted to mention GitHub Copilot because, as they say, appetite comes with eating.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p13">
<p>This book does not describe how to automate data storytelling but how to use generative AI tools as assistants in developing our ideas. Before seeing how to use these tools to do data storytelling, let’s try to understand what lies behind the concept of generative AI.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p14">
<p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of AI; more precisely, it is a subfield of deep learning. Describing the foundations of generative AI is out of the scope of this book, but a quick overview of it is mandatory to understand the general context before we delve into its use. At the time of writing this book, there was a lot of debate surrounding the use of generative AI tools. On the one hand, some people argue that these tools are dangerous, as they could potentially replace human jobs, leading to widespread unemployment. Additionally, they often produce hazardous, biased, and hallucinated results, among other issues. There are worries about the ethical implications of AI decision making, as well as the potential misuse or manipulation of these tools for malicious purposes. On the other hand, other people highlight their benefits, recognizing the level of automation introduced by these tools under the supervision of a responsible user. In this book, I do not take a position, leaving for you the responsibility to use these tools consciously.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p15">
<p>In this book, we’ll try to have a conservative and responsible attitude toward generative AI tools. We will use them as assistants that help us better define our content but which will never replace our supervision and ideas. By “conservative and responsible attitude,” we mean that we will not use the output produced by generative AI tools as the absolute truth. Instead, we will adopt the human-in-the-loop strategy, by always checking the produced output.</p>

<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p16">
<p>This section gives a quick overview of what AI, machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI are. If you are feeling impatient and want to get straight to the main topic—generative AI in data storytelling—skip this section and jump to the next one directly. </p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p18">
<p><em>Artificial intelligence</em> is a discipline aiming to construct intelligent agents capable of independent reasoning, learning, and decision making. AI focuses on developing theories and methodologies to create agents that can emulate human-like thinking and behavior. Figure 4.1 shows the main subfields of AI.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

<p>The figure also highlights the subfield in which generative AI falls. Generative AI is a subfield of deep learning, which is a subfield of machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Now that you have learned the main subfields of AI, let’s focus on machine learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p21">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">4.1.2</span> What is machine learning?</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p22">
<p><em>Machine learning</em> (ML) is a subfield of AI that enables computers to acquire knowledge and improve performance by learning from examples. Consider, for example, the case of assessing whether an outfit is fashionable or not. Without ML, you would have to code every line description. Instead, using ML will require collecting and labeling a substantial dataset of outfit descriptions and fashion elements. Then, you will use it to train an ML model to recognize whether the outfit is fashionable or not. Different from traditional programming, where you must write the code line by line to provide instructions, ML allows machines to learn from data and make predictions or take actions based on that learned information. This approach empowers machines to discover patterns, relationships, and insights that may not be immediately apparent to human programmers. ML relies on different types of learning. The most popular are supervised learning and unsupervised learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p23">
<h4 class="readable-text-h4">Supervised learning</h4>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p24">
<p><em>Supervised learning</em> starts with a problem to solve and a dataset of labeled data, which already contains the solved problem for a subset of samples. First, within the labeled data, input features must be extracted. Input features represent the distinct attributes of the data that the model will analyze to learn patterns and relationships. In supervised learning, there is a preliminary phase, called <em>training</em>, during which algorithms learn from labeled data. During training, each sample in the training dataset is paired with its corresponding label or output. The algorithm learns how to map input features to their respective outputs by generalizing from the provided labeled data. During the training phase, the algorithm optimizes its parameters to minimize discrepancies between the predicted outputs and the true labels. Once the training phase is completed, the algorithm can make predictions or classify new, unseen instances based on the patterns it has learned from the labeled data. Use this technique for tasks such as image classification, sentiment analysis, spam detection, and speech recognition.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p25">
<p>In supervised learning, there are two main types of tasks:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p26"> <em>Classification</em>—This involves predicting a categorical or discrete class label for an input. For instance, given an input (like an image or a set of features), the algorithm predicts which category or class it belongs to. The classes are distinct and predefined. Examples include spam detection (classifying emails as spam or not spam) and image recognition (identifying objects like cats or dogs in images). </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p27"> <em>Regression</em>—Here, the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value. Instead of predicting a class label, regression algorithms predict a quantity. For example, predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms is a regression problem. The output is a range of values rather than distinct classes. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p28">
<p>Both classification and regression are part of supervised learning because they rely on labeled data, where the algorithm is trained on input–output pairs to learn the relationship between inputs and their corresponding outputs.</p>
</div>

<h5 class="callout-container-h5 readable-text-h5">Challenge: Identifying classification vs. regression in healthcare</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p30">
<p>Consider the following scenario. A healthcare system aims to predict whether a patient has a particular disease based on various medical test results. The system takes blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators as input and outputs whether the patient is diagnosed with the disease. Can you identify if this scenario is an example of classification or regression?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p31">
<p>Figure 4.2 shows an example of a classification model. First, the model must be trained with sample data and class labels. As a result of the training process, the model has learned how to discriminate between two classes: circles and squares. When the model receives new data as input, it predicts the class associated with each sample as the output.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

<h4 class="readable-text-h4">Unsupervised learning </h4>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p34">
<p>In <em>unsupervised learning</em>, algorithms identify the hidden structure and patterns in unlabeled data, where no specific outputs or labels are provided during training. Common unsupervised learning techniques include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p35">
<p>Figure 4.3 shows an example of a clustering model. The model has not been previously trained with data. Instead, it applies an internal formula to group data.

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p39">
<p><em>Deep learning</em> (DL) is a subfield of ML that focuses on training artificial neural networks to process and understand complex data. Inspired by the human brain, DL models consist of multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes, known as <em>artificial neurons</em> or <em>units</em>. The greater the number of layers, the more complex the data structure the network can recognize. DL is quite resource intensive because it requires high-performance GPUs and large amounts of training data. You can use DL models to solve tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and even game playing. </p>
</div>

<div class="readable-text" id="p42">
<p>Let’s break it down:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p43"> <em>Input layer</em>—This is the first layer of the DL network where data is fed into the network. In this case, there is one input layer with three nodes. Each node represents a feature or input variable. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p44"> <em>Hidden layers</em>—These are the intermediate layers between the input and output layers where the network learns patterns and representations from the input data. In this network, there are three hidden layers, each with four nodes. The number of nodes in each hidden layer can significantly affect the network’s learning capacity and performance. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p45"> <em>Output layer</em>—This is the final layer of the network that produces the output. In this case, there are two output nodes, which means the network is designed to produce two outputs. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p46">
<p>Now that you have seen an overview of DL, let’s move on to the next step: defining generative AI.</p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p47">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">4.1.4</span> What is generative AI?</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p48">
<p><em>Generative AI</em> is a subfield of DL aimed at creating new content based on what it has learned from existing content. The result of the learning process from existing content is a statistical model (generative model), which is used to generate new content. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p49">
<p>Generative models try to understand data distribution. Suppose we have a dataset of pictures of circles and squares. Generative models learn the overall patterns and characteristics of both circles and squares. Then, using this understanding, they generate new pictures that look similar to the ones they have seen. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p50">

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p52">
<p>The model depicted in figure 4.5, from text to images/code, is an example of a generative model specific to this book. In general, <em>generative</em> means that we can do some interpolation in the feature space and get a somewhat meaningful output in the label space.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p53">
<p>A generative model takes a <em>prompt</em> as an input. A prompt is a piece of text used to direct output quality. It serves as a guide for the generative model to generate responses or outputs that align with a specific desired outcome. The basic prompt is a text asking the tool to perform a specific action. In chapter 2, you have written some basic prompts to make Copilot generate the code to build an Altair chart.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p54">
<p><em>Prompt engineering</em> is a discipline aimed at carefully crafting and refining the prompts to achieve the desired results. The goal of prompt engineering is to elicit responses that are coherent, relevant, and aligned with the desired outcome, while minimizing any unintended biases or undesired behavior. Now that you have learned what generative AI is, let’s move on to describing the generative AI tools landscape.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p55">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">4.1.5</span> Generative AI tools landscape</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p56">
<p>You can use generative AI in several contexts, including for generating text, images, code, speech, and much more. For each specific task, you can use a different tool. In all cases, you start with a text prompt, which the tool converts into the desired output (text, image, code, and so on) based on its specific nature. For most services, you must pay a fee to use generative AI tools. However, some generative AI tools have free-of-charge versions with downgraded capabilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p57">
<p>Figure 4.6 shows the main application fields of generative AI tools (Madhvani, 2023). If not properly used, these tools may produce wrong or biased information. Thus, you must carefully monitor and adjust the generated output to ensure accuracy and fairness.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p59">
<p>The figure also highlights the application fields used in this book:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p60"> <em>Text-to-text tools</em>—Use them to generate text, such as for content creation, chatbots, virtual assistants, creative writing, and automating repetitive tasks like writing emails or generating reports. Examples of text-to-text tools include Open AI ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Claude AI, developed by Anthropic. In this book, we’ll focus on ChatGPT. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p61"> <em>Text-to-image tools</em>—Use them to generate visual representations based on textual input. In this book, we’ll use Open AI DALL-E. If you signed up to DALL-E before April 6, 2023, you will be granted free credits. New users must buy credits for a small fee to use the service. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p62"> <em>Text-to-code tools</em>—Use them to generate code. In this book, we’ll focus on GitHub Copilot, which requires an active subscription. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p63">
<p>You may ask why you should pay to use a tool. The main answer is that quality generative AI tools are only available for a fee; free tools are either not up to par or are very limited until you pay or subscribe. Fortunately, the fees are fairly small. Fully open source tools are free, but the computing resources they require are not free. On the other hand, paid generative AI tools are expensive, but computing is factored into the price.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p64">
<p>We could have used ChatGPT to generate code. However, we prefer to use Copilot, primarily for the following three reasons:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p65"> <em>Code-specific expertise</em>—Copilot is specifically designed for coding tasks and is trained on a vast amount of code from GitHub repositories. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p66"> <em>VSC integration</em>—Copilot is integrated directly into Visual Studio Code (VSC), allowing developers to access its suggestions and code completions while working on their projects within their programming editor. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p67"> <em>Focus on code generation</em>—Copilot primarily focuses on generating code snippets and assisting developers during the coding process. It’s optimized to assist with writing functions, classes, and entire blocks of code, providing quick suggestions based on the context of the code being written. </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p68">
<p>While ChatGPT can offer assistance with programming tasks, its primary function isn’t specifically tailored to coding. It’s intended for general-purpose use and can assist with a wide range of tasks, which are not solely limited to programming. Additionally, in my personal experience, ChatGPT has an occasional tendency to invent an imaginary Python method or function (this is a case of hallucination), as shown in figure 4.7.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p70">
<p>We asked ChatGPT to generate a hexbin chart, and ChatGPT used the <code>mark_hex()</code> method, which is not currently implemented in Altair. This is an example of <em>hallucination</em>, a topic we’ll discuss more deeply in chapter 10. For now, it is sufficient to know that a generative AI model can hallucinate, meaning it could produce outputs that convincingly resemble real data, even though these outputs may not be explicitly grounded in reality. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p71">
<p>We have chosen specific tools to generate text, images, and code for data storytelling. However, you can easily adapt the described concepts to other tools with minimal effort. In all cases, it’s crucial to provide accurate and concise instructions to ensure the tool generates the correct output. Write specific and unambiguous instructions, using simple language and avoiding complex terminology. Also, write consistent instructions regarding syntax, language, and format. Inconsistent instructions can confuse the tool, leading to incorrect outputs.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p72">
<p>Now that we have quickly defined the context of generative AI tools, we can move on to the next step: using generative AI tools for data storytelling. We will start with ChatGPT; then describe DALL-E; and, finally, cover GitHub Copilot.</p>

<h2 class="readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">4.2</span> The basic structure of a ChatGPT prompt</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p74">
<p>To interact with ChatGPT, you must write an input text (prompt) that defines the instructions to be performed. You can use the ChatGPT web interface or the Open AI API, as appendix A describes.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p75">
<p>There are several different ways to structure a prompt for ChatGPT. In this book, we consider a prompt to be composed of three main consecutive texts:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p76"> <em>Tell ChatGPT to act in a specific role. </em>For example, “You are an examiner looking at high school students’ English papers.” </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p77"> <em>Tell ChatGPT to tailor its outputs to an intended audience. </em>For example, “Explain your gradings in a way that can be understood by high schoolers.” </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p78"> <em>Define the task. </em>For example, “Grade this text, and explain your reasoning.” </li>

</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p80">
<p>Although we have tested this prompt structure, sometimes, it doesn’t produce the desired output, so you can refine the prompt using different iterations. In the remainder of this section, we’ll describe all the parts of a prompt separately. Although the structure of a prompt should be <em>role</em>, <em>audience</em>, <em>task</em>, we’ll start by describing first the task to perform, to show how the produced prompt changes when varying the roles and the audience.</p>

<li class="readable-text" id="p101"> <em>Information</em>—The focus is on keeping the audience informed about a specific topic, such as news updates or current events. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p102"> <em>Inspiration</em>—The focus is to motivate the audience, such as sparking creativity or encouraging personal growth. Inspirational messages often share success stories or showcase role models. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p103"> <em>Invitation to action</em>—The focus is to motivate the audience to engage in a specific behavior or event. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p104"> <em>Relationship building</em>—The focus is to foster connections with the audience through personal anecdotes and shared experiences. The message aims to build trust, strengthen existing relationships, or cultivate a sense of community. </li>

<div class="readable-text" id="p110">

<p>All the outputs have the same structure ([title] [colon] [subtitle]), but their meaning is adapted to the specific audience. Consider again the title generated specifying only the role: <em>Embracing Fragility Together: Fostering Authentic Connections and Building Resilient Relationships</em>. This title is similar to that generated for a general audience. When you add a specific audience, the title is tailored to it. Now that you have learned the basic concepts for defining a prompt for ChatGPT, let’s move on to the next step: defining a prompt for DALL-E.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p118">
<h2 class="readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">4.3</span> The basic structure of a DALL-E prompt</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p119">
<p>To interact with DALL-E, you must write a prompt specifying the instructions. You can use either the DALL-E web interface or the Open AI API, as described in appendix A.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p120">
<p>There are several different ways to structure a prompt for DALL-E. In this book, we consider a prompt composed of the following:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p121"> <em>A subject</em> </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p122"> <em>A style</em> </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p123">
<p>In the remainder of this section, we’ll describe all the parts of a prompt separately, starting with the subject. Remember that if the output is not satisfying, you can refine it or use the Edit Image tool, as described later in this section.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p124">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">4.3.1</span> Subject</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p125">
<p>The subject of an image is the main focus that captures the viewer’s attention. Examples of subjects include persons, objects, or scenes. When defining the subject of your image, be as specific as possible. A generic subject will generate a generic image. For each input, DALL-E generates four output images. In the remainder of the section, we’ll show some examples of produced images. If you try out the tool for yourself, you’ll obtain different examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p126">
<p>Figure 4.8 shows the output produced by DALL-E for the prompt <em>a person</em>. Since the input is very generic, the output is also very generic. The four generated images are different from each other.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p127">
<img alt="figure" height="262" src="../Images/4-8.png" width="1100"/>
<h5 class="figure-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Figure 4.8</span> The output for the prompt a person</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p128">
<p>To improve the focus of the image, you can add the following elements:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p129"> An adjective </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p130"> An emotion </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p131"> Context </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p132"> Color </li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p133">
<p>Let’s start by adding an adjective that qualifies the subject. We will give a specific example of generating images related to <em>poor people</em>. I chose this theme to show the potential of inserting images into a data story to arouse emotions in the audience. In fact, data storytelling also gives voice to the people behind data.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p134">
<p>Figure 4.9 shows the outputs for the prompt <em>a poor person</em>, where <em>poor</em> is the qualifying adjective. All the produced images feature a person with a hand on their head but not necessarily person who is poor. However, with respect to the generic output, we have obtained a better result.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p135">
<img alt="figure" height="262" src="../Images/4-9.png" width="1100"/>
<h5 class="figure-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Figure 4.9</span> The output for the prompt a poor person</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p136">
<p>To be more specific, add an emotion describing the person’s mood. Figure 4.10 shows the output produced by the prompt <em>a sad, poor person</em>.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p137">
<img alt="figure" height="263" src="../Images/4-10.png" width="1100"/>
<h5 class="figure-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Figure 4.10</span> The output for the prompt a sad, poor person</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p138">
<p>The figure still needs to be improved. Let’s add a background, creating context for the subject. Figure 4.11 shows the output produced by the prompt <em>a sad, poor person, with rubbish in the background</em>. <span class="aframe-location"/></p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p139">

<h5 class="figure-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Figure 4.11</span> The output for the prompt a sad, poor person, with rubbish in the background</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p140">
<p>Finally, let’s add color. Figure 4.12 shows the output for the prompt <em>a sad, poor person, </em><em>wearing a torn brown shirt with rubbish in the background</em> (to see this in color, visit the e-book version).<span class="aframe-location"/></p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p141">

<h5 class="figure-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Figure 4.12</span> The output for the prompt a sad, poor person wearing a torn brown shirt with rubbish in the background</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p142">
<p>Now, the output looks satisfying. We can proceed to the next step: adding style.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p143">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">4.3.2</span> Style</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p144">
<p>Style defines the type of art that will be output, including photographs, digital art, pencil drawings, and so on. In addition, you can specify a particular artist’s style, such as Van Gogh or Caravaggio. You just have to indulge your imagination!</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p145">
<p>Figure 4.13 shows the output for the prompt <em>a sad, poor person, with rubbish in the background, digital art</em>, and figure 4.14 shows the output for the prompt <em>a sad, poor person, with rubbish in the background, black and white photograph</em>.<span class="aframe-location"/><span class="aframe-location"/></p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p146">
<img alt="figure" height="264" src="../Images/4-13.png" width="1100"/>
<h5 class="figure-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Figure 4.13</span> The output for the prompt a sad, poor person wearing a torn brown shirt with rubbish in the background, digital art</h5>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p147">

<h5 class="figure-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Figure 4.14</span> The output for the prompt a sad, poor person wearing a torn brown shirt with rubbish in the background, black and white photograph</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p148">
<p>The prompt structure described in this chapter is only an entry point to drawing images using DALL-E. You can also define the environment (indoor or outdoor), the hour of day, the angle, and more. You can find more information in <em>The DALL·E 2 Prompt Book </em>(<a href="https://mng.bz/0GNx">https://mng.bz/0GNx</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p149">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">4.3.3</span> The Edit Image tool</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p150">
<p>If you are not completely satisfied with a generated image, you can modify it using the Edit Image tool provided by the DALL-E interface. To access this tool, select the image, and then click Edit. You can erase a part of the image (as shown in figure 4.15), add a new generation frame, or upload an image.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p151">

<h5 class="figure-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Figure 4.15</span> Using the eraser</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p152">
<p>Then, you can write a new prompt for the selected part. Let’s add a dog to the image of figure 4.15 using the following prompt: <em>a small black dog eating a piece of bread, black and white photograph</em>. Figure 4.16 shows the produced output.<span class="aframe-location"/></p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p154">
<p>We finally have all the pieces: ChatGPT, DALL-E, and GitHub Copilot (from the previous chapter). Now, it’s time to implement a practical example, using all the tools. But before that, let’s dust off GitHub Copilot, defining a more systematic approach, to make the best use of it.</p>

<p>When writing instructions for Copilot, split them into single steps. Also, provide the context surrounding what you want Copilot to do, and provide specific details on the requirements of the code you are writing. Finally, remember that Copilot is a tool designed to assist developers, not replace them. Copilot is powerful, but it can’t replace you as a developer. Always use your expertise to evaluate the code suggestions provided by Copilot, and ensure they are appropriate for your specific needs.</p>

This can be attributed to a lack of clarity in the chart, which makes it difficult for us to interpret the data effectively. In practice, the problem is the difference in scale between the variables.

<h2 class="readable-text-h2">Summary</h2>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p283"> Generative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence, aiming at generating new content based on the trained data. You can use generative AI for different purposes, including text, image, code, video, and speech generation. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p284"> A prompt is an input text containing the instructions for a generative AI tool. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p285"> ChatGPT is a text-to-text generative AI tool. To write effective prompts for ChatGPT, structure the prompt in three parts: role, audience, and subject. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p286"> DALL-E is a text-to-image generative AI tool. To write effective prompts for DALL-E, define the subject and the style. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p287"> Copilot is a text-to-code generative AI tool. To make Copilot write code suggestions efficiently, write specific and unambiguous instructions, using simple language and avoiding complex terminology. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p288"> Don’t use Copilot as a substitute for you as a developer. Rather, use it to assist you while programming. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p289"> Always keep in mind that generative AI cannot be a substitute for your creativity and reasoning capabilities. </li>
