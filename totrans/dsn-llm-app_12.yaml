- en: In this part of the book, we shift our focus to the application layer. Until
    now, we have explored LLMs as standalone concepts, but we will now examine how
    they integrate into larger software systems. To this end, we will delve into popular
    application paradigms such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agents.
