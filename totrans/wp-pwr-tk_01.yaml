    one, you can struggle with limitations and inflexibility from then on. In addition,
    you have to choose a quality hosting service, which stores your site on a server
    in the cloud. Choose the wrong one, and when you need technical assistance (and
    we all do now and then), you’ll get delays, bad advice, or no response at all!
    This chapter is all about making the right moves before you even start deciding
    on your site’s structure and design.

    use. Recall that WordPress *can* be installed on your hard drive, but this isn’t
    recommended. You would have to handle technical problems such as security, uptime,
    and many other tasks best left to a WordPress hosting service located in the cloud.
    A key benefit of a hosting service is that you have access to tech support when
    something goes wrong.

    named WordPress.com. But that free version has limitations—no plugins allowed,
    for example. However, for small, simple, personal blogs, it can be sufficient.
    WordPress.com does also offer premium, paid plans, but many reviewers say they’re
    not a good value when compared to independent hosting services like SiteGround.com,
    Bluehost.com, or DreamHost.com.

    a *domain name*. This is the URL, the unique address on the internet of your site’s
    *home page*. Examples of URLs are bbc.com, amazon.com, and facebook.com.

    URLs are called *permalinks)* but the site’s *domain name* is the URL of its home

    to your home page. Note that permalinks are normally composed of the site name
    plus a slug (often the title of the interior page). An example of a permalink
    is *cnn.com/world*.

    is willing to pay a fortune for them). Voice.com was sold in 2019 for $30 million

    Also look at whether a spike in traffic to the site affects the load speed.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note One important technology that contributes to rapid page display is *caching.*
    To speed up the display of a page, hosting services *cache* (store) pages from
    your site that were previously displayed. When that same page is requested again,
    the host can just slap that already-rendered, cached page onto the visitor’s screen.
    This avoids the delay caused by the rendering process. (To display a fresh page,
    the browser must perform a variety of tasks—fetching images from your WordPress
    Media Library; looking at any CSS code to see if a font size, for example, differs
    from what the theme’s CSS style sheet specifies; scanning HTML code to figure
    out where to position the page elements; and so on. So you’ll want a host that
    caches its sites’ pages efficiently.)

    that your hosting service offers its own robust security system, and that you

    they offer multiple servers around the world to store your site. Your pages load
    more quickly if the server hosting your site is located at least on the same continent
    as your primary audience. Many people who might otherwise join your audience simply
    won’t tolerate sluggish page-load times. And some in your audience will also have

    different pages, such as a menu-construction page, a Media Library, and an add
    new plugins page. However, we’ll call them screens rather than pages, to distinguish
    them from the site’s actual pages as viewed by your audience. The backend is the
    view of the site that only you, the administrator (or others you give permission
    to), can get into. Here, you’ll add new pages, perform housekeeping, make improvements,
    and otherwise build and maintain the site. It’s the engine room, down below what
    your visitors see. Visitors are kept to the frontend, the public area of the site.

    on your hosting service is to go visit the backend of your site. Its address is
    based on what you chose for your site’s URL (domain name) when you signed up with
    your hosting service. For example, if your domain name is [https://mysitesname.com](https://mysitesname.com),
    then your backend address is https://mysitesname.com/wp-admin.

    append /wp-admin to your domain name. When you first visit the backend, bookmark
    (or favorite) it in your browser. In addition, when your browser asks if you want
    to save the username and password, do so to easily go there whenever you want
    to work on the site. And note that when you want to look at your frontend, just
    remove the appended /wp-admin part of the address.

    offer functionalities such as drag-and-drop layouts, WYSIWYG dynamic design, and
    page templates, as well as additional functionality such as tools for fine-tuning

    you make. WordPress doesn’t do that. Instead, when you modify content in a page
    on your site, you must click the Update button (or several synonyms that WordPress
    displays for that button).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Here’s one problem with those synonyms: WordPress isn’t consistent in naming
    the buttons that save your work. For example, when you first create a new page
    in WordPress, the button that saves your work is labeled *Publish*. Then, that
    same button’s label changes to *Update*. It’s not good UI design to change the
    name of a button. Beginners are often confused by this. It would be an improvement
    if all the buttons that save your work were simply all named Save.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: WordPress is normally intuitive. The UI is well-designed. But these save buttons
    are confusing because they have different meanings. It’s just something you have
    to get used to. For one thing, *publish* normally means *make public*. In other
    words, you would think that clicking Publish means that your audience can now
    see the most recent version of a page you just modified. But that’s not always
    so. If the page is cached (stored for future display), they won’t necessarily
    see the new version, particularly if the caching algorithm considers the modification
    minor.
