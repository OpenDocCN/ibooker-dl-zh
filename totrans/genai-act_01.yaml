    use it when we use a search engine, read a product recommendation, listen to a
    curated playlist, or use the suggested words as we type on a phone—all these actions
    are powered by AI. However, everything seems new in AI today, with the world on

    public interest and ignited global enthusiasm. OpenAI's ChatGPT has significantly
    boosted its popularity, attracting 100 million users in two months—the fastest
    user adoption of any technology in human history. Many businesses view this technology
    as the key driver for the next wave of digital transformation and automation.
    Generative AI creates new content and processes that can enhance various business
    operations. It is already being used to generate a wide range of content, from
    images, text, and music to more complex outputs, such as design patterns and code.
    Its potential is vast and exciting, capable of generating almost anything—from
    new game levels to novel recipes and much more.

    something new that is not modified or copied from its training data. Whereas traditional
    AI makes predictions based on input data, generative models create new things
    by predicting the next set of words based on their ability to generate and understand
    the semantics of the real world. These new things span a wide range of text, images,
    music, and 3D models. We will see how enterprises can adapt to using these new
    techniques. Generative AI, akin to an imaginative artist or an inventive novelist,
    paints vivid pictures from fragments of information, writes poetry that touches
    the soul, and builds whole universes from thin air. Welcome, dear readers, to
    the awe-inspiring world of generative AI—a realm where machines learn to understand,
    analyze, and create.

    on how computers can learn from data. Instead of explicitly programming computers
    to carry out tasks, in ML, we develop algorithms that can learn from and make
    predictions or decisions based on data. This data-driven decision-making is applicable
    to numerous real-world scenarios, ranging from spam filtering in emails to recommendation
    systems on e-commerce platforms.

    neural networks with several layers. These networks attempt to simulate the behavior
    of the human brain—albeit in a simplified form—to learn from large amounts of
    data. While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximate predictions,
    additional hidden layers can help optimize its accuracy. DL drives many AI applications
    today and helps execute tasks with improved efficiency, speed, and scale.

- en: An AI model is a sophisticated algorithmic structure trained on extensive datasets
    to autonomously perform specific tasks such as text generation, translation, and
    decision-making. These models learn from data patterns to mimic human cognitive
    abilities, which enables them to understand and generate natural language. Once
    trained, developers should recognize that these models can process and analyze
    data independently, using ML and DL techniques. ML models apply mathematical frameworks
    to data for predictions, while DL models use neural networks for complex tasks
    involving unstructured data. In essence, an AI model is a self-sufficient tool
    that can carry out intelligent tasks based on learned data patterns after training,
    which are crucial for creating smart applications.

    worth noting that generative AI does not understand the content as humans do.

- en: We can use generative AI, specifically a large language model (LLM), to extract
    entities from text. Entities are pieces of information that are of interest to
    us. In the past, we would need to use a named entity recognition (NER) model for
    entity extraction; furthermore, that model would need to have seen the data and
    be trained as part of its dataset. With LLM models, we can do this without any
    training, and they are more accurate. While traditional NER methods are effective,
    they often require manual effort and domain-specific customization. LLMs have
    significantly reduced this burden, offering a more efficient and often more accurate
    approach to NER across various domains. A key reason is the Transformer architecture,
    which we will cover in the next few chapters. This is a great example of traditional
    AI being more rigid and less flexible than generative AI.

    estimations soaring from $1.75B in 2022 to a projected $33B by 2027 and an impressive
    CAGR of 80% [2]. Industry experts from Bloomberg Intelligence forecast a staggering
    market expansion to $1.3 trillion in a decade, a leap from the $40B recorded in
    2022 [3]. GenAI's widespread adoption is evident in various industries, including
    financial services and customer relationship management, driven by its capacity
    to enhance insights and productivity. Considering Gartner’s prediction that 90%
    of service providers will incorporate GenAI for software development by 2027 [4],

    existing ones. Many enterprises use it for different use cases inside and outside
    their organizations. Some of these are for improving their workflow or efficiency,
    while others provide better services or products to their customers. Depending
    on the purpose, the challenges of using generative AI vary. For instance, one
    common challenge is when the AI system produces something that does not make sense
    (i.e., it makes up things—also called hallucinations). This is usually easier
    to handle internally than externally because customers might have higher expectations
    or lower trust in the AI system.
  prefs: []

    because the underlying model cannot distinguish between facts and fiction in its
    training data. LLMs are trained to generate coherent, context-aware text rather
    than factually accurate responses. They tend to hallucinate when the prompt or
    context is inaccurate but relevant to the task. We will cover hallucinations and

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Traditional AI, which some now refer to as narrow AI, is predominantly the
    common form of AI we encounter today. It uses classical data science and a systematic
    approach to extracting insights and knowledge from data using various methods
    and techniques. It typically involves the following steps: data collection, data
    preparation, data analysis, feature engineering, training, and data validation.
    Traditional AI predicts things operating within pre-established boundaries on
    which it has been trained. These boundaries are the rules and instructions that
    are coded in a model. It can only act based on predefined conditions, constraints,
    and potential outcomes. Thus, the outcome is deterministic and relatively predictable.
    For instance, a traditional AI could be programmed to automate customer service
    through chatbots by generating responses based on predefined scripts. While these
    systems are highly effective within their prescribed domain, they stay within
    their lanes and cannot learn and adapt to situations outside their programmed
    knowledge—hence the narrow aspect. Almost all the AI implementations that enterprises
    have done thus far are traditional AI.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, generative AI leans toward a probabilistic approach, where the
    outcome is calculated based on probabilities influenced by the input data and
    learned patterns. This allows these AI systems to create outputs that were neither
    hard-coded nor explicitly taught to the system. Generative AI needs the classical
    data science process, which enhances and complements it in many ways. Generative
    AI can help deal with new types of data and content, evaluate the quality and
    validity of generated outputs, and ensure the ethical and responsible use of generative
    AI. Classical data science and generative AI must work together to create value
    and impact from data.

    AI models is by using a prompt, as we have seen in the examples. More formally,
    a prompt is a set of instructions that tells the generative AI system what kind
    of content we want to create. The better the prompt, the better the results. A
    prompt should be tailored to the type of response you want to receive and to the
    specifics of the generative AI you use. We will cover prompt engineering in more

    and outline the steps needed at a high level. Throughout the next few chapters,
    we will dig into more technical details, including guidance on implementation
    and best practices. Figure 1.7 shows a high-level overview of what a typical workflow
    in an enterprise might look like.

    you want to address with generative AI? How can it help you the most? This could
    be anything from creating content for marketing to enhancing customer service
    with chatbots, forecasting for business plans, or even innovating new products
    or services. In our example, we are building an Enterprise ChatGPT, such as OpenAI’s
    ChatGPT, but one that is deployed and runs in an enterprise environment, using
    internal and proprietary data, and only authorized users can access it.

    to relevant, high-quality enterprise data that the user can employ. This data
    needs to be ingested and indexed to help answer proprietary questions. Before
    that, the data must be managed properly, ensuring privacy and legal compliance.
    Remember, the quality of the data fed will influence the output quality.

    applications that address the use case and the problem we are trying to address.
    As an enterprise, we will also want to address the risks associated with generative
    AI and implement corporate guidance around safety and responsible AI.

    AI is not a one-time event but a journey. It requires continuous monitoring, testing,
    and fine-tuning to ensure it works optimally and responsibly. It’s a good idea
    to start with smaller, manageable projects and gradually scale up as you gain
    more confidence and expertise in handling this powerful technology.

    enterprise, but it requires careful planning, appropriate resources, ongoing monitoring,
    and an unwavering focus on ethical considerations. With these in place, your enterprise
    can reap the numerous benefits of generative AI.
