- en: I’ve been writing code for a very long time now—longer than I care to admit—and
    I’ve seen the winds and waves of change that have swept across the software development
    industry multiple times (and written about or trained on many of them). From the
    internet to CI/CD to containers to cloud, the paradigm shifts have upended the
    old ways of doing things, and spawned innovation, incredible tools, and turnarounds
    in our approaches to creating software. And, broadly, those shifts have also generated
    uncertainty and confusion as individuals tried to understand them and figure out
    how to adapt and apply their skills..
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now we have generative AI, arguably the biggest wave of change we have encountered
    in tech, especially for those developing software. Just like the others, it is
    inspiring massive innovation and driving massive changes. But in some respects,
    it resembles more of a tsunami where new tools, new models, and new capabilities
    exhibit tremendous power, all while coders are being swept along and trying to
    keep our collective heads above water.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is my attempt to help you surf the wave—at least as far as using the
    AI powerhouse that is GitHub Copilot. I won’t claim it will answer all your questions,
    but hopefully it will help you get to a very good comfort level with the tool,
    let you understand its capabilities (from basic to advanced topics), and inspire
    you to make your coding tasks simpler and easier than they’ve ever been before.

    as a former DevOps director piloting it in a corporate R&D organization, as a
    trainer on Copilot for multiple vendors, as a skeptic, and as an enthusiast. Regarding
    those last two roles, I wasn’t as impressed with Copilot in its early days as
    I was with other tools. But over the course of writing this book, developing courses
    on it, and watching it evolve, it’s become one of the primary tools I use on a
    regular basis when working in my integrated development environment (IDE) or in
    GitHub. Copilot has come a long way, even in the last few months. There’s been
    some impressive progress with features and functionality. I’ve tried to capture
    as many of those as I could in the book.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'One of my goals in writing these chapters is to share the benefits and the
    challenges of using Copilot, and try to help you avoid surprises. So, before you
    jump in, here’s a few things to be aware of:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the last year or so, GitHub Copilot has changed the appearance and location
    of at least one dialog or control with nearly every release. I’ve done my best
    to update screenshots and descriptions as they are at the time of writing. But
    it’s certain that some will have been moved, changed in appearance, etc. by the
    time you are reading this.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Copilot is now releasing new features on a fairly regular basis. So, over time
    there will be new features that are not represented in the book. Likewise, some
    functionality in Copilot is noted as being in *preview* or *experimental* as of
    the time of writing. Those may have been moved to production by the time you read
    this or may have been removed if they didn’t make the cut.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Copilot runs in many different environments, including multiple IDEs. In each
    IDE, there can be (and are) differences in integration, appearance, and even functionality.
    GitHub has historically prioritized Visual Studio Code and the environments that
    use the same interface (like GitHub Codespaces) to roll out new features and to
    contain the superset of functionality. For that reason, all screenshots and examples
    in the book are done with either VS Code or in a Codespace.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For those of you using non-VS Code IDEs, some features or functions may have
    not been implemented by GitHub in that environment. Please consult the Copilot
    and/or IDE [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot) for the latest
    information.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, IDEs that integrate with Copilot can usually be run on multiple platforms
    including Windows, Mac, and Linux. Since it’s not practical to cover all the variations
    in the book, the examples were done on a Mac. So the windows and controls shown
    may reflect the Mac style. Also keyboard shortcuts will differ among the platforms.
    To avoid having to list all keyboard shortcuts each time we reference them, we’ve
    adopted *Meta* as a notation that means to insert the appropriate shortcut for
    your platform.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of these things apply across the entire structure of the book, which was
    written to take you from the *What is it* basics to the advanced *Here’s how you
    go beyond the core functionality*. Most of the chapters can be read standalone,
    and you should feel free to skip between chapters as your needs and comfort level
    dictate.

    you through the foundations you need to understand what Copilot is and how to
    interact with it in its two main modes—code completion and the chat (conversational)
    interface.

- en: This book is for anyone who is trying to learn more about using AI assistants
    for developing software. Yes, it’s specifically about GitHub Copilot, but many
    of the examples and flows have parallels in other AI coding tools and environments.
    To get the most out of this book, you should already have experience coding in
    an IDE and have a basic knowledge of GitHub. To be clear, this book is not going
    to teach you how to code, how to use an IDE, or how to use GitHub. But it will
    help you multiply your productivity in all of those areas through using Copilot.
    Whether you are a software developer, quality engineer, SRE, or someone who is
    just looking to understand how an AI assistant like Copilot can benefit them,
    I believe you’ll find meaningful information and insights.

    guides, reports, articles, and other documents I’ve written over the years. Getting
    from a proposal to a finished product is an incredible investment of time and
    energy not only from the author, but from a team of people to bring things to

    in, and advocated for, this book—as he did on my behalf for so many other projects.
    John, I hope you’re enjoying a well-deserved retirement! And thanks to Louise
    Corrigan for picking up from John to continue the effort. Over my time working
    with O’Reilly, I have truly come to respect and appreciate the role of acquisition
    editors to support meaningful projects and to provide quality training opportunities
    and find new ways to bridge learning gaps. Their roles are most often behind the
    scenes, but their efforts are core to much of the learning that I and other content
    creators get to bring to the attendees of O’Reilly Learning.

    Michele Cronin as the development editor for the project. Michele was also the
    development editor on *Learning GitHub Actions*, so I knew she was the right person
    to make this project complete, polished, and successful. Behind the scenes, Michele
    has put in many hours keeping the project (and me) on track, helping resolve any
    potential roadblocks, lining up reviewers and consolidating feedback, and always
    being available for any questions. As well, she has provided sage advice on how
    to navigate any and all challenges that have come up along the way. She has been
    an optimistic and supportive guide throughout the process, and I am very much
    appreciative of all that she has done and the experience and guidance she provided
    that made this book possible.
