    for each training instance. Not only do all these features make training extremely
    slow, but they can also make it much harder to find a good solution, as you will
    see. This problem is often referred to as the *curse of dimensionality*.

    of features considerably, turning an intractable problem into a tractable one.
    For example, consider the MNIST images (introduced in [Chapter 3](ch03.html#classification_chapter)):
    the pixels on the image borders are almost always white, so you could completely
    drop these pixels from the training set without losing much information. As we
    saw in the previous chapter, [Figure 6-6](ch06.html#mnist_feature_importance_plot)
    confirms that these pixels are utterly unimportant for the classification task.
    Additionally, two neighboring pixels are often highly correlated: if you merge
    them into a single pixel (e.g., by taking the mean of the two pixel intensities),
    you will not lose much information, removing redundancy and sometimes even noise.'

    For example, if you pick a random point in a unit square (a 1 × 1 square), it
    will have only about a 0.4% chance of being located less than 0.001 from a border
    (in other words, it is very unlikely that a random point will be “extreme” along
    any dimension). But in a 10,000-dimensional unit hypercube, this probability is
    greater than 99.999999%. Most points in a high-dimensional hypercube are very

    be roughly 0.66\. But what about two points picked randomly in a 1,000,000-dimensional

    the dataset’s dimensionality (e.g., SVMs or dense neural networks). And new instances

    reliable than in lower dimensions since they will be based on much larger extrapolations.

    fewer than in the MNIST problem—all ranging from 0 to 1, you would need more training
    instances than atoms in the observable universe in order for training instances
    to be within 0.1 of each other on average, assuming they were spread out uniformly

    model will usually speed up training, but it may not always lead to a better or
    simpler solution; it all depends on the dataset. Dimensionality reduction is typically
    more effective when the dataset is small relative to the number of features, especially
    if it’s noisy, or many features are highly correlated to one another (i.e., redundant).
    And if you have domain knowledge about the process that generated the data, and
    you know it’s simple, then the manifold assumption certainly holds, and dimensionality
    reduction is likely to help.

    The fewer dimensions, the smaller the model, and the faster training and inference
    will be. But if you shrink the data too much, then you will lose too much signal

    we are left with 154 features, instead of the original 784 features. So the dataset
    is now less than 20% of its original size, and we only lost 5% of its variance!

    and split it into a training set and a test set (take the first 60,000 instances
    for training, and the remaining 10,000 for testing). Train a random forest classifier
    on the dataset and time how long it takes, then evaluate the resulting model on
    the test set. Next, use PCA to reduce the dataset’s dimensionality, with an explained
    variance ratio of 95%. Train a new random forest classifier on the reduced dataset
    and see how long it takes. Was training much faster? Next, evaluate the classifier
    on the test set. How does it compare to the previous classifier? Try again with
    an `SGDClassifier`. How much does PCA help now?

- en: Use t-SNE to reduce the first 5,000 images of the MNIST dataset down to 2 dimensions
    and plot the result using Matplotlib. You can use a scatterplot using 10 different
    colors to represent each image’s target class. Alternatively, you can replace
    each dot in the scatterplot with the corresponding instance’s class (a digit from
    0 to 9), or even plot scaled-down versions of the digit images themselves (if
    you plot all digits the visualization will be too cluttered, so you should either
    draw a random sample or plot an instance only if no other instance has already
    been plotted at a close distance). You should get a nice visualization with well-separated
    clusters of digits. Try using other dimensionality reduction algorithms, such
    as PCA, LLE, or MDS, and compare the resulting visualizations.
