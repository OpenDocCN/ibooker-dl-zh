    their applications, users, and operations. This data holds valuable insights that
    can be used to make decisions, predict trends, and improve system performance.
    The ability to analyze and act on this data has become a critical skill for software
    engineers.

    understand user behavior or spot some malfunction in their processes, in ways
    that go well beyond simply querying the data to count and sum fields. Again, the

    data about what happened in the past and use it to draw conclusions about what
    will happen in the near future. This forecasting can be a game-changer for businesses
    that do it well, and the companies that develop and use it as a key part of their
    decision-making processes treat these projects and algorithms as sensitive intellectual
    property.

    into actionable insights to help teams make smarter decisions. They also show
    how expensive and time-consuming these projects have been, historically. High
    costs and complexity have limited sophisticated projects in these fields to companies
    that have the funds and the technically capable teams to drive them. Most small
    to medium businesses, startups, and nontech businesses face high barriers to developing
    such tools, which hinders their ability to compete in this global market. The
    promise of AI tools in this sector is to democratize access to such tools among
    all market participants, regardless of their size, sector, or the technical abilities
    of their teams.

    how much data cleaning is required. For example, if a dataset contains lots of
    empty fields or inconsistent field types, it takes significant specialized work
    to clean the dataset for analysis, as well as advanced techniques like data normalization

    its reply ([Figure 5-18](#ch05_figure_18_1749441076711476)) was underwhelming
    and generic enough to apply to any business, rather than being specific to this
    dataset and the underlying business.

    provisioning based on a significant marketing investment, started off quite well.
    ChatGPT estimated that the marketing investment would produce a sales increase
    of 20% to 40% in this customer segment.

    again, the sales numbers it predicts are lower than the current year’s. To me,
    this suggests that ChatGPT calculated the number of items to be sold *only* to
    this high-value customer segment and “forgot” to include the items sold to all
    other clients.'

    it offered a good amount of context and reasoning in response to the other questions,
    despite some obvious issues with the calculations. I believe some of these issues
    might be mitigated with prompt engineering. It’s also worth noting that ChatGPT
    isn’t really a native data analysis tool: unlike the other tools analyzed here,
    it renders clunky tables and has no ability to render charts.'

- en: My first challenge with this comparison is that all three of the tools I analyzed
    were subject to a black-box effect. I input a large volume of data, and within
    seconds these tools output good-looking tables, charts, and write-ups with conclusions
    and insights that appear to make sense. It would be easy to assume that the information
    provided by these tools is correct, given their impressive speed and output.

    against the reference dataset ([Figure 5-20](#ch05_figure_20_1749441076711515);

    tools *missed* the product with most units sold (“Small Popcorn Holder”). I dug
    a bit into this quirk, but I couldn’t figure out why. I can speculate that, since
    this item has a very low unit price, perhaps a rounding-to-zero type of error
    could have caused it to be missed.

    they provided and their pitfalls. From a UX perspective, Akkio stands out from
    the other tools. It sets a higher expectation by offering what seems like a very
    robust process with multiple steps and tools. However, it ends up standing out
    negatively, because the level of contextualization it provides for each interaction
    is way below what the other tools offer.

    but offer insights into what’s happening and how my data is being processed. Both
    of those tools include text in their replies alongside the tables and charts,
    to provide context and reasoning for their operations and to show users how to
    read the data and interpret the results.

    similar to ChatGPT’s, and even the underlying model is in part the same (GPT-4,
    as I write this in mid-2024), its data analysis capabilities, such as rendering
    charts in the chat conversation, are not available in ChatGPT.

- en: I rated all three tools between 5 and 7 ([Table 5-1](#ch05_table_1_1749441076713702)),
    given these shortcomings. I expect these tools to evolve a lot in the coming years,
    but in my opinion, they are not yet reliable enough that you can simply give them
    a large volume of data, ask questions, and trust the results. If you use them,
    I recommend running scripts locally to double-check the numbers. (It’s OK if your
    scripts are generated by AI tools, since you can review and modify the code and
    have full visibility and control over the data analysis, as you saw in Chapters
    [2](ch02.html#ch02_user_interface_and_user_experience_design_1749441075495781)
    and [3](ch03.html#ch03_bug_detection_and_code_review_1749441076008122).)

- en: After more than 15 years working with software development and data science
    teams, I can confidently say that AI tools have the potential to become game-changers
    in how we handle data analysis and business intelligence. Their ability to clean
    and analyze massive datasets in seconds, rather than days, will transform what’s
    possible for businesses of all sizes.

    from early-stage startup founders to business teams at Fortune 500 companies,
    I can easily imagine these AI tools empowering nontechnical stakeholders to extract
    insights from their data. The effects of that empowerment could be immense. In
    some cases, it might mean skipping costly data engineering projects; in other
    cases, it just makes those projects faster and less expensive.

    results can be very impressive on the surface, they come with significant flaws,
    calculation errors, and generic explanations. A distracted user might be easily
    fooled by the instant reward of good-looking charts and insights, but overlooking
    such shortcomings can result in serious negative consequences. Business stakeholders
    could make decisions that reduce the value of their business; data analysts who
    delegate their work to these tools might end up performing poorly in their jobs.'

    the “black box” effect can make it very hard to identify those limitations. Always
    be specific in your prompts, and always double-check the results by doing manual
    analysis or running local scripts. I always tell my teams to treat AI-generated
    insights like advice from a colleague: while it’s valuable input, always validate
    it and do your own critical thinking before making any big decisions.'
