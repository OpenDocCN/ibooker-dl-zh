    is also available in GitHub. There is a general one at [*https://github.com/copilot*](https://github.com/copilot).
    Also, on the Code page of your repositories, you’ll see a Copilot icon in the
    top row of controls (as shown in [Figure 9-1](#copilot-icons-in-repo)). Clicking
    the icon will take you to an immersive (full-screen) Copilot chat interface for

- en: Copilot has built-in functionality to also summarize GitHub issues. It does
    this by using tools (like GitHub’s own APIs) to parse the issue’s content. This
    includes the issue’s body, title, comments, and even linked pull requests (if
    they exist). The goal is to create a summary overview of the main points you need
    to be aware of. Depending on the extent of information available in the issue,
    the summary will typically include the primary problem, the components that are
    affected, what the functionality should be, and potential fixes.

    and provide prompts to get information or help with the issue. [Figure 9-29](#asking-copilot-to-sum)

- en: In this chapter, we’ve covered the various integration points that Copilot has
    with the GitHub web interface. By having this direct integration, Copilot’s utility
    is greatly extended and readily available when working with repositories and common
    GitHub mechanisms such as issues and pull requests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The integration with GitHub is done mostly through Copilot’s chat interface.
    A GitHub repository has multiple places to invoke the chat dialog and converse
    with Copilot by using natural language. If you are working on an issue, a pull
    request, or a fix and start up a new Copilot chat session, Copilot can identify
    that as the context and offer relevant questions as a starting point.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For more specific responses tailored to one or more files, you can add files
    as context in a chat. When looking at a change in a pull-request code diff, you
    can also add individual files or even tell Copilot to reference only part of a
    file with a particular fix when it generates its responses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Copilot can also summarize changes made in a pull request as an overall set
    of comments. Those summary comments will include links to specific changes and
    allow you to reduce the work of creating a pull request. It can also assist with
    summarizing and answering questions based on GitHub issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, it’s worth noting that Copilot can be added and participate as a reviewer
    on pull requests. Acting as an automated reviewer, Copilot can provide feedback
    and suggestions in the body of the pull request just as a human reviewer would
    do.
