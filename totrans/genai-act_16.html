   <p>Different chapters in this book explain different code snippets well, but running various code samples together is challenging. Instead of piecing all the code together and then trying to run it, you can find it in the GitHub repository, and this appendix outlines the details.</p>

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p3"> 
   <p>As we have seen across various chapters, the book’s GitHub repository has an easy-to-remember short URL: <a href="https://bit.ly/GenAIBook">https://bit.ly/GenAIBook</a>. The URL redirects to the repository, which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/bahree/GenAIBook">https://github.com/bahree/GenAIBook</a>.</p>

   <p>This GitHub repo offers a few things that might be of interest:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p5"> The chapters in the GitHub repository neatly organize the code from the different examples in the book. The filenames correspond to the listing numbers in the chapter, making it a breeze to locate specific examples. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p6"> The chapters also discuss and cite research papers related to various AI technologies and methods. The compilation is arranged by chapter, facilitating the access to the pertinent research papers. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p7"> Detailed, up-to-date instructions are provided for setting up dependencies on your machine to run everything. Given the fast-paced changes in the field, paper is not the ideal medium to explain them, as they can become outdated quickly. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p8"> There is a simple web application you can run locally that brings many of these concepts together and can almost become your personal ChatGPT. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p9"> The GitHub repository provides discussions and points to problems, which enables feedback and improves the book and the material throughout the development process, especially since AI has been evolving rapidly. </li> 
  </ul>
