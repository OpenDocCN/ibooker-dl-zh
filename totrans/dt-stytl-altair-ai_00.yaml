    Python Altair? What benefits would generative AI introduce to building data stories?
    You’ll find the answers to each of these questions in part 1 of this book. This
    part introduces the use of generative AI in a progressive way: first, we will
    look at GitHub Copilot, and later, in chapter 4, ChatGPT and DALL-E. I chose to
    follow this learning strategy because it is better to first lay the theoretical
    foundations to understand the main concepts and then automate them, using the
    various tools generative AI makes available. Using this approach, you will be
    the full master of generative AI tools, rather than their servant.'

- en: 'Before we enter the wonderful world of data storytelling combined with generative
    AI, I want to warn you of one thing: generative AI is an ever-evolving field,
    so the code you read in this book may be obsolete by the time you attempt to run
    it (although it was updated to the latest version at the time of writing). However,
    the principles described always remain valid, and you can check the official documentation
    of generative AI tools to update the code. Indeed, the code described in this
    book is located on a GitHub repository, so you might even think about opening
    issues on broken code to keep the GitHub repository continuously updated. It would
    be a fantastic way to collaborate together, and I would be really grateful if
    you did.'

    it to communicate the insights extracted during data exploration and analysis.
    To build a data story, you’ll also be introduced to the data, information, knowledge,
    wisdom (DIKW) pyramid, the model you’ll use throughout the book. Although other
    models exist to build data stories (e.g., the storytelling arc), I’ve chosen the
    DIKW pyramid as a reference for this book because I believe it’s more straightforward
    and effective. It acts like matryoshka dolls, where the most external piece contains
    all the previous ones, although every single piece can exist as a standalone object.
    Like the matryoshka pieces (aka nesting dolls), each step of the DIKW pyramid
    can live as a standalone (partial) story; however, only the last step, wisdom,
    contains a complete story. In the last part of this chapter, you’ll see a practical
    use case that applies the DIKW pyramid, which will unveil the potential of this
    model. I hope this simple example will pique your interest. However, if it does
    not meet your expectations, I ask you to be patient. Throughout the book, you
    will encounter many other practical case studies and examples, which I hope you
    can use as references in your own real-world scenarios.

    Altair and generative AI. For now, you’ll use only Copilot, but be patient. You’ll
    learn how to use ChatGPT and DALL-E later in the book. In this chapter, you will
    only see Copilot at work. You will not simply implement examples, but you will
    learn the basic techniques to use Copilot as a working tool, not only with Altair,
    but to produce any type of code.

- en: Chapter 3 will review the basic concepts of Altair as well as Vega and Vega-Lite,
    the data visualization grammars behind Altair. You’ll implement practical exercises
    and a final case study using the DIKW pyramid. Compared to the case studies implemented
    in the previous chapters, this one is slightly complex. At the end of this chapter,
    you will have matured enough Altair skills to be ready to use ChatGPT and DALL-E.

- en: In chapter 4, you’ll learn how to structure a prompt for ChatGPT and DALL-E
    and how to use these tools for data storytelling. Before using them, you’ll review
    some general concepts related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep
    learning, and generative AI. This will help you to set the context of generative
    AI tools. In the last part of the chapter, you’ll implement a practical use case,
    showing the potential of generative AI in data storytelling.
