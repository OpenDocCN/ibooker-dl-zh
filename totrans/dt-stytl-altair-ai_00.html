<div class="readable-text" id="p2">
<p>What is data storytelling? How can you implement data-driven stories using Python Altair? What benefits would generative AI introduce to building data stories? You’ll find the answers to each of these questions in part 1 of this book. This part introduces the use of generative AI in a progressive way: first, we will look at GitHub Copilot, and later, in chapter 4, ChatGPT and DALL-E. I chose to follow this learning strategy because it is better to first lay the theoretical foundations to understand the main concepts and then automate them, using the various tools generative AI makes available. Using this approach, you will be the full master of generative AI tools, rather than their servant.</p>

<p>Before we enter the wonderful world of data storytelling combined with generative AI, I want to warn you of one thing: generative AI is an ever-evolving field, so the code you read in this book may be obsolete by the time you attempt to run it (although it was updated to the latest version at the time of writing). However, the principles described always remain valid, and you can check the official documentation of generative AI tools to update the code. Indeed, the code described in this book is located on a GitHub repository, so you might even think about opening issues on broken code to keep the GitHub repository continuously updated. It would be a fantastic way to collaborate together, and I would be really grateful if you did.</p>

<p>In chapter 1, you’ll learn what data storytelling is and why you should use it to communicate the insights extracted during data exploration and analysis. To build a data story, you’ll also be introduced to the data, information, knowledge, wisdom (DIKW) pyramid, the model you’ll use throughout the book. Although other models exist to build data stories (e.g., the storytelling arc), I’ve chosen the DIKW pyramid as a reference for this book because I believe it’s more straightforward and effective. It acts like matryoshka dolls, where the most external piece contains all the previous ones, although every single piece can exist as a standalone object. Like the matryoshka pieces (aka nesting dolls), each step of the DIKW pyramid can live as a standalone (partial) story; however, only the last step, wisdom, contains a complete story. In the last part of this chapter, you’ll see a practical use case that applies the DIKW pyramid, which will unveil the potential of this model. I hope this simple example will pique your interest. However, if it does not meet your expectations, I ask you to be patient. Throughout the book, you will encounter many other practical case studies and examples, which I hope you can use as references in your own real-world scenarios. </p>

<p>In chapter 2, you’ll get your hands dirty by writing your first data story using Altair and generative AI. For now, you’ll use only Copilot, but be patient. You’ll learn how to use ChatGPT and DALL-E later in the book. In this chapter, you will only see Copilot at work. You will not simply implement examples, but you will learn the basic techniques to use Copilot as a working tool, not only with Altair, but to produce any type of code.</p>

<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p6">
<p>Chapter 3 will review the basic concepts of Altair as well as Vega and Vega-Lite, the data visualization grammars behind Altair. You’ll implement practical exercises and a final case study using the DIKW pyramid. Compared to the case studies implemented in the previous chapters, this one is slightly complex. At the end of this chapter, you will have matured enough Altair skills to be ready to use ChatGPT and DALL-E. </p>

<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p7">
<p>In chapter 4, you’ll learn how to structure a prompt for ChatGPT and DALL-E and how to use these tools for data storytelling. Before using them, you’ll review some general concepts related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI. This will help you to set the context of generative AI tools. In the last part of the chapter, you’ll implement a practical use case, showing the potential of generative AI in data storytelling.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p8">
<p>As outlined in the following list, at the end of each chapter, you’ll implement a practical case study, each with a different purpose: </p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p9"> <em>Chapter 1</em>—This case study is only theoretical (without any code) and focuses on some statistics related to an <em>advertising campaign</em> about pets. You’ll find the code for this example in the GitHub repository for the book. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p10"> <em>Chapter 2</em>—This case study describes a simplified <em>decision-making process</em> related to the opportunity for a hotel to build a new swimming pool. You’ll implement two versions: one using and one without using GitHub Copilot. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p11"> <em>Chapter 3</em>—This case study focuses on a <em>data-journalism</em>-like example, studying population growth in North America. The example is more advanced than those implemented in the previous chapters. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p12"> <em>Chapter 4</em>—This case study involves again a <em>decision-making process</em>. This one adds generative AI to the preceding case studies. </li>
</ul>
