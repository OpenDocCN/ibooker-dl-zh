    training the whole model or part of the model. Chapters [5](ch05.html#ch05a_prompt_engineering_1730156991195551)
    and [6](ch06.html#ch06_rag_and_agents_1730157386571386) discuss prompt-based methods,
    which adapt a model by giving it instructions, context, and tools. Finetuning

    domain-specific capabilities, such as coding or medical question answering, and

    At the scale of today’s foundation models, naive finetuning often requires more
    memory than what’s available on a single GPU. This makes finetuning expensive
    and challenging to do. As discussed throughout this chapter, reducing memory requirements
    is a primary motivation for many finetuning techniques. This chapter dedicates
    one section to outlining factors contributing to a model’s memory footprint, which

    annotated (question, answer) data, you can finetune it on raw legal documents.

    language models can be autoregressive or masked. An autoregressive model predicts
    the next token in a sequence using the previous tokens as the context. A masked
    model fills in the blank using the tokens both before and after it. Similarly,
    with supervised finetuning, you can also finetune a model to predict the next
    token or fill in the blank. The latter, also known as *infilling finetuning*,
    is especially useful for tasks such as text editing and code debugging. You can
    finetune a model for infilling even if it was pre-trained autoregressively.

    customer-specific queries, finetuning the model on customer-specific queries might
    help.

    is that if the base model perpetuates certain biases from its training data, exposing
    it to carefully curated data during finetuning can counteract these biases ([Wang
    and Russakovsky, 2023](https://oreil.ly/iPwB_)). For example, if a model consistently
    assigns CEOs male-sounding names, finetuning it on a dataset with many female
    CEOs can mitigate this bias. [Garimella et al. (2022)](https://oreil.ly/RoPL4)
    found that finetuning BERT-like language models on text authored by women can
    reduce these models’ gender biases, while finetuning them on texts by African
    authors can reduce racial biases.

    training knobs you can tweak, monitor the learning process, and debug when something

    can help optimize token usage. The more examples you add to a prompt, the more
    input tokens the model will use, which increases both latency and cost. Instead
    of including your examples in each prompt, you can finetune a model on these examples.
    This allows you to use shorter prompts with the finetuned model, as shown in [Figure 7-2](#ch07a_figure_2_1730160615799676).

    ability to generate outputs in the expected format and, therefore, often requires
    finetuning. Semantic parsing is discussed briefly in Chapters [2](ch02.html#ch02_understanding_foundation_models_1730147895571359)
    and [6](ch06.html#ch06_rag_and_agents_1730157386571386). As a reminder, semantic
    parsing means converting natural language into a structured format like JSON.
    Strong off-the-shelf models are generally good for common, less complex syntaxes
    like JSON, YAML, and regex. However, they might not be as good for syntaxes with
    fewer available examples on the internet, such as a domain-specific language for
    a less popular tool or a complex syntax.

    computation speed. First, it allows a larger batch size, enabling the model to
    process more inputs in parallel. Second, reduced precision speeds up computation,
    which further reduces inference latency and training time. To illustrate this,
    consider the addition of two numbers. If we perform the addition bit by bit, and
    each takes *t* nanoseconds, it’ll take *32t* nanoseconds for 32 bits but only
    *16t* nanoseconds for 16 bits. However, reducing precision doesn’t always reduce

- en: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is built on the concept of *low-rank factorization*,
    a long-standing dimensionality reduction technique. The key idea is that you can
    factorize a large matrix into a product of two smaller matrices to reduce the
    number of parameters, which, in turn, reduces both the computation and memory
    requirements. For example, a `9 × 9` matrix can be factorized into the product
    of two matrices of dimensions `9 × 1` and `1 × 9`. The original matrix has 81
    parameters, but the two product matrices have only 18 parameters combined.

    in the second factorized matrix correspond to the rank of the factorization. The
    original matrix is *full-rank*, while the two smaller matrices represent a low-rank
    approximation.

    Surprisingly, larger models tend to have lower intrinsic dimensions after pre-training.
    This suggests that pre-training acts as a compression framework for downstream

    the model using a small number of trainable parameters and a small amount of data.

    than using all the constituent models separately. The added value can come from
    improved performance. For example, if you have two models that are good at different
    things on the same task, you can merge them into a single model that is better
    than both of them on that task. Imagine one model that can answer the first 60%
    of the questions and another model that can answer the last 60% of the questions.
    Combined, perhaps they can answer 80% of the questions.

    reduced costs. For example, if you have two models that can do different tasks,
    they can be merged into one model that can do both tasks but with fewer parameters.
    This is particularly attractive for adapter-based models. Given two models that
    were finetuned on top of the same base model, you can combine their adapters into
    a single adapter.

    component (vector) to be merged as a point on a sphere. To merge two vectors,
    you first draw the shortest path between these two points along the sphere’s surface.
    This is similar to drawing the shortest path between two cities along the Earth’s
    surface. The merged vector of these two vectors is a point along their shortest
    path. Where exactly the point falls along the path depends on the interpolation
    factor, which you can set to be between 0 and 1\. Factor values less than 0.5
    bring the merged vector closer to the first vector, which means that the first
    task vector will contribute more to the result. A factor of 0.5 means that you
    pick a point exactly halfway. This middle point is the blue point in [Figure 7-16](#ch07b_figure_13_1730159634220389).

- en: The easiest way to finetune is to use a finetuning API where you can upload
    data, select a base model, and get back a finetuned model. Like model inference
    APIs, finetuning APIs can be provided by model providers, cloud service providers,
    and third-party providers. A limitation of this approach is that you’re limited
    to the base models that the API supports. Another limitation is that the API might
    not expose all the knobs you can use for optimal finetuning performance. Finetuning
    APIs are suitable for those who want something quick and easy, but they might
    be frustrating for those who want more customization.

    each learning step. If you think of learning as finding a path toward a goal,
    the learning rate is the step size. If the step size is too small, it might take
    too long to get to the goal. If the step size is too big, you might overstep the
    goal, and, hence, the model might never converge.

    both of which can contribute to the model’s loss during training. During inference,
    however, prompts are usually provided by users, and the model only needs to generate
    responses. Therefore, response tokens should contribute more to the model’s loss
    during training than prompt tokens.

    loss compared to responses. If this weight is 100%, prompts contribute to the
    loss as much as responses, meaning that the model learns equally from both. If
    this weight is 0%, the model learns only from responses. Typically, this weight
    is set to 10% by default, meaning that the model should learn some from prompts
    but mostly from responses.

    finetuning, the more memory finetuning needs. Most practitioners don’t have access
    to sufficient resources (hardware, time, and data) to do full finetuning with
    foundation models.
