<h1><span class="label">Chapter 5. </span>Other AI-Assisted Programming Tools</h1>
<p>While GitHub Copilot is the big shot when it comes to AI-assisted programming, plenty of other great tools are available. It’s common for developers to mix and match a few of them in their day-to-day coding. What’s nice is that most of these tools follow GitHub Copilot’s lead, so getting the hang of them isn’t too tough. You’ll use a comment to kick off a command<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="# (hashtag character), for comments" data-type="indexterm" id="id549"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="comments" data-secondary="hashtag (#) for" data-type="indexterm" id="id550"/> and use handy shortcuts to get quick suggestions, and they also have a handy chat feature.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’re going to dive into different AI programming tools. We’ll check out those from the big leagues like Amazon and also some neat finds from startups. Plus, we’re not leaving out open source options—like Meta’s Code Llama—because they’re definitely worth a look too.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Amazon’s CodeWhisperer" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="amazonapostrophes_codewhisperer">
<h1>Amazon’s CodeWhisperer</h1>
<p>Amazon CodeWhisperer<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Amazon CodeWhisperer" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_AWSCodeWhisperer.05.7.21"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="CodeWhisperer (Amazon)" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_CodeWhispererAWS.05.7.21"/> is like a Swiss Army knife extension for IDEs like VS Code, PyCharm, and AWS Lambda. It’s powered by an LLM trained on massive amounts of code and understands 15 programming languages. Amazon’s been careful about adding new languages, focusing on accuracy and security rather than speed to market. There are two versions of CodeWhisperer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Individual version is free—just sign up with your AWS Builder ID or Amazon login. It gives code suggestions, tracks where open source code comes from, and does security checks.</p></li>
<li><p>CodeWhisperer Professional costs $19 a month per user. It’s got everything that Individual has, plus some extra features useful to bigger companies. There’s an admin system to manage who gets access to what, and you can even control the type of open source data used.</p>
<p>The cool part of the Professional edition is the customization feature. Companies can tweak CodeWhisperer to give more relevant code suggestions based on their own libraries, APIs, and frameworks. This means better quality and less time wasted on outdated code. You can set up to eight different customizations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dive into two of CodeWhisperer’s features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>reference tracker</em> keeps<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="reference tracker, CodeWhisperer" data-type="indexterm" id="id551"/> an eye on how your code compares to open source listings, showing what kind of licenses the open source code is using for the distribution. This is useful for staying on the right side of the law and intellectual property (IP) rights<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="intellectual property (IP) rights" data-type="indexterm" id="id552"/>. Reference tracking shows annotations to the project’s repository, file reference, and license information. This can be helpful in making a decision as to whether to use the suggestion or not, based on your organization’s compliance requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>security scan</em> runs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="security" data-secondary="CodeWhisperer’s scan" data-type="indexterm" id="id553"/> in your IDE, checking for vulnerabilities, including the top 10 Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)" data-type="indexterm" id="id554"/> threats and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)" data-type="indexterm" id="id555"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)" data-type="indexterm" id="id556"/> listings. It even follows best practices for crypto libraries<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="crypto libraries" data-type="indexterm" id="id557"/>. If the security scan spots a vulnerability, it will offer up some fixes. This speeds things up and cuts down on development costs. Considering the quirks that can come with AI-generated code, having this built-in security feature is a huge plus.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A perk of CodeWhisperer is how it meshes with AWS services. This means that developers don’t need to be AWS wizards or slog through heaps of docs to use AWS. Here are a few examples of what you can prompt it to do:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> # Write a Python function to upload a file to an S3 bucket.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> # Construct a Python Lambda handler to process records from a Kinesis stream.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> # Write a Java method to query items from the DynamoDB table by sort key.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> # Write a bash script to stop an EC2 instance by instance ID using AWS CLI.</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> # Create an RDS instance with a PostgreSQL engine using AWS CDK in TypeScript.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazon did a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer">study</a> on customers using CodeWhisperer and found that, on average, developers were 27% more likely to successfully finish tasks and did so 58% faster than developers who did not use the tool.</p>
<p>Take Accenture<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Accenture" data-type="indexterm" id="id558"/>’s experience, for instance. Using CodeWhisperer for AI projects managed to <a href="https://oreil.ly/SFmVt">cut development time by up to 30%</a>. Tasks like preprocessing data, usually time-consuming and tedious, got a lot quicker and more efficient. By simply using prompts like the following, developers significantly boost their productivity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> # Create a preprocessing data class script for ML data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider Persistent Systems<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Persistent Systems, and CodeWhisperer" data-type="indexterm" id="id559"/>, a global digital engineering firm. Normally, new developers needed at least four months of training to get project-ready<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_AWSCodeWhisperer.05.7.21" data-type="indexterm" id="id560"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_CodeWhispererAWS.05.7.21" data-type="indexterm" id="id561"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_AmazonCodeWhisperer.05.7.21" data-type="indexterm" id="id562"/>. However, with CodeWhisperer, they <a href="https://oreil.ly/K4ovC">slashed this time to just one month</a>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Google’s Duet AI for Developers" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="googleapostrophes_duet_ai_for_developers">
<h1>Google’s Duet AI for Developers</h1>
<p>Google is the brains behind Duet AI for Developers<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Duet AI for Developers (Google)" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_DuetAIforDevelopersGoogle.05.36.54"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Google’s Duet AI for Developers" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_GooglesDuetAIforDevelopers.05.36.54"/>. This nifty AI-powered programming tool supports IDEs like VS Code, IntelliJ, PyCharm, GoLand, WebStorm, Cloud Workstations, and Cloud Shell editor. Plus, it’s got your back with over 20 programming languages. It’s also built on Gemini<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Google’s Gemini" data-type="indexterm" id="id563"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Gemini" data-type="indexterm" id="id564"/>, which is Google’s top-of-the-line LLM.</p>
<p>Duet AI has the features you would typically see with an AI-assisted programming system, such as chat. There are also shortcuts, called smart actions<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="smart actions (Duet AI)" data-type="indexterm" id="id565"/>, which are one-click magic tricks for things like code explanations and unit tests.</p>
<p>Duet AI also takes security<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="security" data-secondary="Duet AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id566"/> seriously. It’s got all the heavy-duty protections and safeguards you need, like Private endpoints (Private Google Access), VPC Service Controls, and enterprise-grade access controls.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget about governance rules<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="governance rules (Duet AI)" data-type="indexterm" id="id567"/>. When you toss your code into Duet AI, you can rest easy knowing it’s not getting used to train any shared models or build products. You’ve got full control when it comes to your data and intellectual property<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="intellectual property (IP) rights" data-type="indexterm" id="id568"/>. It will also flag instances where Duet AI thinks certain code may be copied—at <span class="keep-together">length—from</span> a repository.</p>
<p>A big part of Google’s strategy with Duet is to build an extensive partnership ecosystem. For example, some partners provide support for developers on Google Cloud for certain environments. This allows for better code suggestions as well as documentation and knowledge sources. Here are some examples:</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Tabnine" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="tabnine">
<h1>Tabnine</h1>
<p>Tabnine<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tabnine" data-type="indexterm" id="id583"/> stands as the pioneer in AI-assisted programming tools. It all started in 2013 when Dror Weiss<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Weiss, Dror" data-type="indexterm" id="id584"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Yahav, Eran" data-type="indexterm" id="id585"/> and Eran Yahav set up the company. They’d been in the software game since the 1990s, specializing in code analysis and simulation. But it was their hands-on experience with the complexities of development that led them to a light bulb moment: What if AI could be the solution?</p>
<p>And indeed, it did help. However, this was before the era of transformer models. Faced with no other options, the founders rolled up their sleeves and built their own models. This journey helped them deeply understand AI’s role in software development. Fast-forward to the last few years, and Tabnine has embraced the transformer model.</p>
<p>The company has invested heavily in security<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="security" data-secondary="Tabnine" data-type="indexterm" id="id586"/> systems. Here’s how it works: when you’re typing away on your code, each character gets tokenized and encrypted before being sent over to Tabnine’s inference server, which could be cloud based or on-site. Tabnine makes a point of not storing your data, and no employee gets to read it. Plus, Tabnine provides SOC-2 compliance<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="SOC-2 compliance (Tabnine)" data-type="indexterm" id="id587"/>.</p>
<p>For training its model, the company uses open source code with permissive licenses like MIT, Apache, and BSD. This is important for organizations that are keen on protecting their IP. Tabnine also values transparency about the code it uses for training. It even gives developers ways to opt out of repositories that may be used in Tabnine’s training datasets. This shows the company’s careful approach to licensing when it comes to training generative models.</p>
<p class="pagebreak-before">Tabnine’s pricing structure includes three tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Starter plan is free and caters to individual users, offering basic features like short code completions and community support.</p></li>
<li><p>The Pro plan costs $12 per month per user. It is designed for professional developers and small teams and includes advanced features like whole-line and full-function code completion, as well as natural language–to–code completions, with standard support.</p></li>
<li><p>The Enterprise plan is aimed at larger organizations seeking comprehensive security, control, and customization. It offers unlimited users, private and custom AI models, private deployment options, and premium support. Pricing is available on request.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Tabnine has garnered a large user base, with over a million monthly users and hundreds of thousands engaging with it daily. Notably, some of its prominent customers include tech giants like Google, Amazon, Netflix, and Atlassian.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Replit" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="replit">
<h1>Replit</h1>
<p>Replit<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Replit" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_Replit.05.78.10"/> is a versatile web-based IDE that supports numerous programming languages and allows for hosting applications, known as repls<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="repls (hosted applications in Replit)" data-type="indexterm" id="id588"/>. Its rich collaboration features are similar to those found in Google Docs. Expanding its reach, Replit has also developed a desktop version, which is available for macOS, Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS. The platform boasts a substantial community of around 23 million developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.replit.com/ai4all">Replit</a> was founded in 2016 by Amjad Masad, Faris Masad, and Haya Odeh<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Masad, Amjad" data-type="indexterm" id="id589"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Masad, Faris" data-type="indexterm" id="id590"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Odeh, Haya" data-type="indexterm" id="id591"/>. The concept for Replit was conceived by Amjad over a decade prior to its establishment. During this period, Amjad honed his skills in engineering roles at Yahoo! and Facebook, focusing on building development tools. He was also instrumental in the founding of Codecademy, further showcasing his commitment to innovative technology and education in coding.</p>
<p>Replit offers three subscription tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The free tier provides unlimited public repls and 10GB of storage.</p></li>
<li><p>The Hacker plan costs $7 per month per user and offers unlimited private repls. It comes with varying levels of memory and storage to suit different needs.</p></li>
<li><p>The Pro plan is available for $20 per month per user and includes everything that comes with the Hacker plan. In addition, while the basic system for code development is available with both lower tiers, Pro users gain exclusive access to the most powerful AI model along with advanced features, offering a more robust experience in code development.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>“Replit is an all-in-one software creation platform,” said David Hoang<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Hoang, David" data-type="indexterm" id="id592"/>, VP of marketing and design at Replit. “The product experience is designed to reduce the friction in the software development process: dev environment, code authoring, and deploying to production. Because of this, Replit is able to integrate AI beyond code generation. Our code complete model is also powered by our own language model.”</p>
<p>Replit’s LLM is trained on a whopping one trillion tokens and is capable of understanding 30 programming languages. When working on Replit, the code you write in public repls, including keystrokes, might be used to further train Replit AI. If you’d rather keep your work private<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="privacy" data-secondary="Replit" data-type="indexterm" id="id593"/> and out of the training pool, you can opt to make your repl private. It’s important to note that your rights over your code don’t change when using Replit AI. Code in public repls is automatically licensed under the MIT License, as outlined in Replit’s licensing information.</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#the_ui_for_replit_includes_a_file_tree_a">Figure 5-2</a> shows the IDE. On the top left is a file tree and search box. In the middle, you’ll find the editor, and the output (e.g., the console) shows up on the right side of the screen. On the bottom left, you see the available tools.

<dl>
<dt>Explain</dt>
<dd><p>Replit offers a feature to give a helpful explanation of your code. If the explanation doesn’t quite hit the mark, you can simply click Retry to ask Replit to take another shot. Additionally, if you have specific questions, there’s an Ask Chat option available from a pull-down menu at the top of the Explain box. Replit provides other useful functionalities as well, such as Ask Replit Documentation, Edit Code, and Generate Code, to assist with your coding.</p></dd>
<dt>Modify (Ctrl+I)</dt>
<dd><p>In Replit, you have the ability to modify code through prompts. For example, if you’ve highlighted a section of code for a binary search, you can write a prompt requesting a transformation of that Python code into a JavaScript function. Alternatively, you could ask for the code to be altered to use a recursive approach. The Modify feature offers a flexible and interactive way to experiment with and refine your code.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>To showcase just how user-friendly and powerful this tool is, let’s check out some interesting stories:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Diabetes app</dt>
<dd><p>When London-based iOS developer Marwan Elwaraki learned of his younger brother’s diabetes diagnosis, he was determined to create an app for monitoring blood sugar levels. He and his wife, Salwa Al Alami, wanted to team up to create something useful and unique. “While on a plane, I prototyped a Lock Screen widget by connecting a widgets app with the blood sugar tracker’s API and was able to see my brother’s blood sugar,” said Marwan. “This was significantly better than having to open the app to see the latest reading.”</p>
<p>They added buttons to send messages and improved the texting capabilities. Then they published it as a public app on the iOS App Store.</p>
<p>While Marwan was an experienced mobile frontend developer, he had little experience with Python or backend development, and Salwa was a product manager with no coding experience. At first, they used ChatGPT, but Replit AI would make a big difference. “The AI tools have helped generate or at least double-check almost all the backend written for my app,” said Marwan. “I’ve heard the stories about big increases in developer productivity and I can honestly vouch this in my case.”</p></dd>
<dt>Hackathon to startup</dt>
<dd><p>Priyaa Kalyanaraman, with her impressive stints as a product manager at Microsoft, Snapchat, and Waymo, lacked a technical background but didn’t let that stop her. She took part in the Craft Ventures AI Hackathon, leveraging Replit AI to whip up an app designed to simplify and add fun to content creation. Her efforts paid off handsomely as she clinched the $10,000 grand prize. Leveraging her product management expertise, she meticulously prepared detailed specs and logically structured the app. This winning app later became the foundation for her startup, Lica, which successfully secured a pre-seed investment round<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_Replit.05.78.10" data-type="indexterm" id="id594"/>.</p></dd>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Cody" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="cody">
<h1>Cody</h1>
<p>In 2013, Quinn Slack<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Slack, Quinn" data-type="indexterm" id="id598"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Liu, Beyang" data-type="indexterm" id="id599"/> and Beyang Liu came together to found Sourcegraph<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Sourcegraph" data-type="indexterm" id="id600"/>, with the aim of developing code<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Cody" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_Cody.05.126.107"/> search tools. Beyang was inspired by his experience at Google, where he saw firsthand the advantages of the company’s internal platform for code intelligence and insights, which was especially beneficial for handling large codebases.</p>
<p>Sourcegraph’s primary goal became the creation of advanced tools to tackle “big code.” The level of complexity is a significant challenge in this field. A <a href="https://oreil.ly/Pu6Gp">survey by Sourcegraph</a> highlighted this issue: about 77% of developers reported a fivefold increase in their codebases over three years. What’s more, 72% expressed concern that the burgeoning scale of big code could pose a real threat to their company’s capacity for innovation and competitiveness.</p>
<p>AI plays a crucial role in Sourcegraph’s strategy, and the company has developed an AI-driven code generation system named Cody. Cody relies on LLMs from Anthropic and OpenAI. There is also the use of Starcoder as well.</p>
<p>“We have leveraged our search capabilities for this tool,” said Liu. “Keep in mind that 80% of a developer’s time is about reading and understanding code, not creating it. So with Cody, it scans the whole codebase. But we also make it easy to bring in other libraries and frameworks. What we have seen is that there are better results.”</p>
<p>Here are some of the prompts you can use with this platform:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How is this repository structured?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What does this file do?</p>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Where is X component defined?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of pricing, Sourcegraph offers a free product and two paid tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The free tier includes various features like code autocomplete, chat, and context awareness.</p></li>
<li><p>The Pro edition costs $9 per user per month. With Pro, you get:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unlimited autocompletes, messages, and commands</p></li>
<li><p>Personalization with larger codebases</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple LLM choices for chat</p></li>
<li><p>A higher level of support</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Enterprise edition is tailored to the needs of larger organizations. It costs $19 per user per month and offers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>User management</p></li>
<li><p>Single-tenant deployment</p></li>
<li><p>Audit logging</p></li>
<li><p>Pooled organization usage</p></li>
<li><p>Daily rate limits while in beta</p></li>
<li><p>Web and API access</p></li>
<li><p>Configurable LLMs</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>To get a sense of Cody’s potential, let’s consider what Deepak Kumar, a full-stack developer and an open source contributor to Cody, has to say: “The features that stand out for me are the Chat and the Commands. I use the Chat to answer any coding-related questions, starter ideas for a project, or fix a bug.

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Warp" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="warp">
<h1>Warp</h1>
<p>The command-line interface<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Warp" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_Warp.05.182.30"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="command line interface (CLI)" data-secondary="Warp" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_commandlineinterfaceCLIWarp.05.182.30"/> started back in the 1960s, growing up alongside the early days of operating systems like Multics and Unix. While flashy graphical interfaces have emerged over the years, the CLI has mostly stayed true to its roots. It’s all about keeping it simple: you type your commands in plain text and get back just what you need, no frills attached.</p>
<p>CLIs are incredibly widespread despite their simplicity. They’re essential for taking care of cloud systems, dealing with files and programs on your computer, and setting up smooth workflows. They’re good at automating tasks, processing data, managing networks, and developing software.</p>
<p>Getting the hang of CLIs can seriously speed things up and make you more precise. A standout benefit is that you can mix and match different commands to handle complex tasks. Plus, since you can program these command lines, you’ve got much more room to tweak things to your liking and automate tasks. This means developers can set things up just how they need them, making their whole workflow smoother and more efficient.</p>
<p>While CLIs are powerful, they’re not perfect. A big problem is that they’re not great for collaboration and so can trip up productivity and teamwork. When you close a terminal session, you lose everything. Command lines are also usually stuck on one machine, making it a pain to switch between devices. Moreover, terminals can be intimidating, especially for tricky tasks. And let’s not forget: getting good with CLI commands and their syntax isn’t exactly a walk in the park for a lot of people.</p>
<p>So yes, there is room for innovation in the category. And a startup that is helping to lead the way is <a href="https://www.warp.dev">Warp</a>.</p>
<p>Zach Lloyd<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Lloyd, Zach" data-type="indexterm" id="id604"/>, who is the founder and CEO, started the company in 2020. Before this, he <a href="https://oreil.ly/_Zhk7">worked</a> at Google as a principal engineer for Google Sheets. “I’ve been a developer for over 20 years,” said Lloyd. “While the CLI is powerful and very useful, there was lots of room for improvement.”</p>
<p>Warp was built with Rust<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Rust" data-type="indexterm" id="id605"/>, a programming language that’s known for being fast and efficient. Instead of sticking to the usual JavaScript, Warp uses Rust’s strengths to run almost like an app you’d install on your computer, but instead it’s right in your browser. This clever twist with Rust means a smoother and snappier experience for anyone using Warp, making the whole interaction with the app a lot better.</p>
<p>Think of Warp as a terminal on steroids. It boasts advanced text input features like selections, cursor positioning, and completion menus, allowing users to seamlessly navigate their command history. This eliminates the hassle of scrolling through long texts. Furthermore, Warp makes copying output a breeze with a simple click.</p>
<p>In Warp, every command and its output form a distinct block. You can effortlessly hover over these blocks to revisit past commands. Selecting a block enables the use of Warp AI, accessible via the right-click menu, which provides explanations and solutions for errors. This is in stark contrast to traditional CLIs, which offer limited guidance and depend heavily on the user’s expertise to decipher error messages and troubleshoot.</p>
<p>Warp AI also comes with a chat<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="chat function" data-secondary="Warp AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id606"/> function. You use this by starting the prompt with a #. For example, suppose you want to know the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> # How do I use grep to exclude directories in a recursive search?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warp will provide an answer to this question, which you can then copy into the <span class="keep-together">terminal</span>.</p>
<p>Now keep in mind that Lloyd is an avid user of Copilot<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="Warp" data-secondary-sortas="Warp" data-type="indexterm" id="id607"/> for his own development. “I use this tool alongside Warp,” he said. “They work very well together.”</p>
<p>A big fan of Warp is Mike Krieger<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Krieger, Mike" data-type="indexterm" id="id608"/>, a cofounder of Instagram. He <a href="https://oreil.ly/VwV0f">said</a>, “I have been using Warp every day at work. My favorite thing is the speed: both in terms of how fast it works and also how fast you feel while using it, especially the excellent type-ahead and search. Warp brings terminals into the modern day, and I can’t wait to see where they take Warp.”</p>
<p>Warp is available on Mac, Linux, and Windows. There is a web version as well. The pricing for Warp is structured into three tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The free version provides up to 20 AI requests daily.</p></li>
<li><p>For more extensive use, there’s the Team edition, priced at $12 per month for each user and offering up to 100 AI requests per day.</p></li>
<li><p>Larger organizations with specific requirements will want to consider the Enterprise version, with custom pricing tailored to the customer’s needs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_Warp.05.182.30" data-type="indexterm" id="id609"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_commandlineinterfaceCLIWarp.05.182.30" data-type="indexterm" id="id610"/>.</p></li>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Bito AI" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="bito_ai">
<h1>Bito AI</h1>
<p>In 2006, Amar Goel<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Goel, Amar" data-type="indexterm" id="id611"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Das, Anand" data-type="indexterm" id="id612"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="PubMatic" data-type="indexterm" id="id613"/> and Anand Das started PubMatic, an online advertising company<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Bito AI" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_BitoAI.05.207.84"/>, and took it public in 2020. Their journey with PubMatic led them to recognize the potential of AI to enhance coding productivity, sparking the idea for Bito AI. Mukesh Agarwal<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Agarwal, Mukesh" data-type="indexterm" id="id614"/>, with his experience as a product lead at Microsoft and Ernst &amp; Young, joined them as a part of the founding team.</p>
<p>Bito has multilingual capabilities, supporting 20 languages, including unique blends like Hinglish, a combination of Hindi and English.</p>
<p>This tool is equipped with several notable features. One allows you to create custom prompt templates for frequently used coding structures, streamlining the development process. Moreover, the platform includes security and performance checks, providing recommendations for optimizations to enhance both the safety and efficiency of code.</p>
<p>Bito boasts a substantial context window<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="context window" data-secondary="Bito AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id615"/> of approximately 240,000 tokens, enhancing its understanding and analysis capabilities. Furthermore, it uses a vector database that’s local to the user’s machine. This enables the system to effectively handle large codebases, ensuring the generation of more relevant and accurate results. This capability significantly contributes to the tool’s efficiency and effectiveness in managing extensive coding projects.</p>
<p>It is also good with handling memory leaks<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="memory leaks, Bito AI’s handling of" data-type="indexterm" id="id616"/>. These happen when a program grabs some of your computer’s RAM and then forgets to give it back. If this keeps happening, it can cause real headaches. As the program keeps running, it keeps leaking memory, which eats into the total memory you have available. This can slow things down, as your system starts using swap space because there’s not enough physical memory left. And if the leakage gets really bad, memory leaks can even make the program or your whole computer crash because it runs out of memory.</p>
<p>Memory leaks can be tricky to spot and fix. They usually don’t cause problems right away and might only start showing up after the program’s been running for a while. This delay makes it even harder to figure out and sort them out. But Bito can sniff out potential memory leaks. You just use the Insert Code Selected in IDE option and throw in a prompt like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Identify any issues with the code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And guess what? It not only flags the problems but also throws in some suggested fixes.</p>
<p>When it comes to privacy<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="privacy" data-secondary="Bito AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id617"/>, Bito makes sure not to store any of your actual code. However, it does keep hold of the metadata that gets generated along the way.</p>
<p>Two versions are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There’s a free version for individual users.</p></li>
<li><p>A paid option is available at $15 per month per user. It includes features like unlimited AI code completions and access to the extensive 240,000-token context window, enhancing the overall coding experience.</p></li>
</ul>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>Based on Bito’s <a href="https://oreil.ly/xKYaw">internal analysis</a>, users of the tool reported a 31% increase in productivity. They also used the tool almost 200 times a month. Currently, the platform boasts around 100,000 users<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_BitoAI.05.207.84" data-type="indexterm" id="id618"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Cursor" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="cursor">
<h1>Cursor</h1>
<p>Anysphere is the developer<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Cursor" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_Cursor.05.229.30"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Anysphere" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_Anysphere.05.229.30"/> of <a href="https://cursor.sh">Cursor</a>. The company certainly has a <a href="https://oreil.ly/E2IrW">bold vision for it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the next few years, we’d like to build a code editor that is more helpful, delightful, and fun than the world has ever seen. Cursor should be a place where it’s impossible to write bugs. An editor where you whip up 2,000-line PRs with 50 lines of pseudo code. A tool where you get any codebase question answered instantly. Perhaps even an interface where the source code itself starts to melt away…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the meantime, Cursor is still quite powerful. It has also attracted interest from investors like OpenAI. In October 2023, the company successfully raised $8 million in funding, bringing its total capital raised to $11 million.</p>
<p>Cursor offers a choice between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, but it also enhances its capabilities with proprietary models. These models include 1.4 billion vectors and access to 150,000 codebases. Additionally, the platform incorporates advanced AI techniques like Merkle trees, further boosting its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Cursor is a fork of VS Code<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Visual Studio Code (VS Code)" data-secondary="and Cursor" data-secondary-sortas="Cursor" data-type="indexterm" id="id619"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="integrated development environments (IDEs)" data-type="indexterm" id="id620"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="operating system platforms" data-type="indexterm" id="id621"/> and is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. This is a huge plus as it spares you the hassle of learning a new IDE. When you download Cursor, it conveniently lets you import your existing VS Code extensions. You can take advantage of its AI features right within the CLI<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="command line interface (CLI)" data-secondary="Cursor" data-type="indexterm" id="id622"/>, seamlessly integrating advanced capabilities into your familiar coding environment.</p>
<p class="pagebreak-before">For example, in the chat area, you can easily import documentation and ask it questions. Here’s a sample prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> @python docs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or you can use @ to work with a particular file<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="@ (at symbol), Cursor prompts" data-type="indexterm" id="id623"/>. You can enter something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What does @the_app.ts do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cursor offers the ability to debug<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="debugging" data-secondary="Cursor" data-type="indexterm" id="id624"/> directly in the terminal. Its AI sifts through your files and engages in a logical process to pinpoint and attempt to resolve the issue, streamlining the troubleshooting experience.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Biles, a full-stack web developer, is an early adopter of Cursor. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really enjoy being able to quickly load app context into the AI with a keystroke. It works great for answering questions, remembering syntax, refactoring small sections of code, and writing boilerplate. However, it reaches its limits when asked to understand larger data models spread across multiple files. However, this will only get better as the models get better, such as with larger context windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tosh Velaga<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Velaga, Tosh" data-type="indexterm" id="id625"/> is another user of Cursor. He is a software engineer and founder of several AI companies like <a href="https://typeblock.co">Typeblock</a> and STBL, which makes <a href="https://www.stablediffusionai.dev">Stable Diffusion</a>. According to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A feature I really like is the Command+L shortcut to ask questions about the code. This is super useful when I’m in a new codebase with a backend language I do not have experience with. This feature has helped me get up to speed much faster. Something else I think is a benefit is that you can bring your own API key so you can save on costs and switch between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_Cursor.05.229.30" data-type="indexterm" id="id626"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_Anysphere.05.229.30" data-type="indexterm" id="id627"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Code Llama" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="code_llama">
<h1>Code Llama</h1>
<p>There’s a growing number of open source<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Code Llama" data-type="indexterm" id="id628"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Meta’s Code Llama" data-type="indexterm" id="id629"/> projects<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="open source AI software" data-secondary="Code Llama" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_opensourceAIsoftwareCodeLlama.05.256.52"/> focused on AI-assisted development, and it’s a hot topic in academic circles, too. One of the big names in this space is Meta. Its <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama">Code Llama system</a> has been making waves since its launch in August 2023.</p>
<p>Code Llama is built on the LLaMA 2 LLM<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="large language models (LLMs)" data-secondary="Meta’s LLaMa 2" data-type="indexterm" id="id630"/>, which is trained on a staggering 2 trillion tokens and a context length of 4,096 tokens. It includes fine-tuned models that have been beefed up with training on over a million human annotations, making them even more effective and reliable.</p>
<p>LLaMA 2 has special versions like LLaMA 2-Chat, which is tailor-made for chat<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="chat function" data-secondary="Code Llama" data-type="indexterm" id="id631"/> applications and outperforms other open source chat models on key benchmarks, especially in helpfulness and safety. Plus, it’s integrated with platforms like Hugging Face and has major partnerships with companies like Microsoft and Amazon for cloud services deployment.</p>
<p>Code Llama is versatile, supporting most of the big languages like Python, C++, Java, PHP, JavaScript, C#, and Bash. It comes in three model sizes with 7, 13, and 34 billion parameters respectively. They’ve all been trained on a massive 500 billion tokens of code. The interesting thing about the 7B and 13B models is that they’re geared up with fill-in-the-middle ability, so they can slot code into existing scripts. This makes them useful for tasks like code completion. The 7B model can run on just a single GPU, and it’s usually quicker. But, as you’d expect, the 34B model packs a bigger punch in terms of power.</p>
<p>Code Llama goes beyond what the LLaMA 2 base model offers. All its models can handle up to a whopping 100,000 tokens in context. This is great for whipping up code for longer programs. This bigger context window<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="context window" data-secondary="Code Llama" data-type="indexterm" id="id632"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="debugging" data-secondary="Code Llama" data-type="indexterm" id="id633"/> makes it a whiz at debugging too.</p>
<p>There are a couple of specialized versions of Code Llama. First up, there’s the Python<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Python, and Code Llama" data-type="indexterm" id="id634"/> version, which has been sharpened by using a massive 100 billion tokens of code. Then there’s the Instruction version. This one has been given extra training in natural language to boost results on natural language applications.</p>
<p>Code Llama 34B has shown impressive results. It has scored a solid <a href="https://oreil.ly/JNY1n">53.7% on HumanEval and 56.2% on MBPP</a> (Mostly Basic Python Programming). These scores are better than those of other open source projects, and Code Llama’s performance is on a par with that of ChatGPT. Moreover, Code Llama has been put through the wringer with security<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="security" data-secondary="Code Llama" data-type="indexterm" id="id635"/> testing. Meta notes that its responses are even safer than ChatGPT’s.</p>

AlphaCode was able to handle different sorts of tough tasks that needed a mix of critical thinking, logic, algorithms, coding skills, and understanding of natural language. This system even got a shoutout for its abilities in <a href="https://oreil.ly/6E7cK"><em>Science</em> magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Code competitions are usually about tricky algorithms and brain-bending theoretical problems, which are a bit different from your everyday programming tasks. Take this one test that AlphaCode has to tackle, a tough problem called Backspace. Competitors had to play around with two strings, <em>s</em> and <em>t</em>, and use Backspace to change <em>s</em> into <em>t</em>. Success is not just about getting the complex problem right. It’s also about coming up with smart algorithms. This shows off the kind of advanced problem-solving skills needed for competitive programming.</p>

They’ve got major advantages: huge customer bases, enormous resources, extensive distribution networks, and trusted brands. Their big talent pool is a big help, too. Plus, they’re large enough in the market to set trends and standards.</p>
<p>Integrating new technology with their existing products means they can offer complete solutions, keeping customers coming back. Because they’ve already got the infrastructure and a global presence, they can scale up these new technologies fast, meeting what the market wants both now and in the future.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some of the code generation systems from these companies:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Salesforce Code Builder</dt>
<dd><p>This makes it easy for a developer<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Salesforce Code Builder" data-type="indexterm" id="id658"/> to <a href="https://oreil.ly/qpHLM">tweak their CRM</a> and other bits and pieces in Salesforce. It helps get things just right with the latest Salesforce languages and frameworks. Furthermore, you can grab third-party add-ons from the Open VSX marketplace, which is a big open playground for VS Code extensions. And the best part? You don’t need to mess around with installing or setting up these features. They’re ready to go right off the bat.</p></dd>
<dt>SAP Build Code</dt>
<dd><p>This is made<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="SAP Build Code" data-type="indexterm" id="id659"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Java and JavaScript (SAP Build Code)" data-type="indexterm" id="id660"/> for <a href="https://oreil.ly/u8cKy">Java and JavaScript users</a>. Plus, it hooks up with SAP Joule, which is SAP’s own AI sidekick. You also get to tap into some powerful database systems, like SAP’s HANA (High-performance ANalytic Appliance).</p></dd>
<dt>StarCoder LLM</dt>
<dd><p>ServiceNow<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ServiceNow Research" data-type="indexterm" id="id661"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Hugging Face" data-type="indexterm" id="id662"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="StarCoder LLM" data-type="indexterm" id="id663"/> and Hugging Face teamed up to create this open source project. It’s beefy, with 15 billion parameters and trained on a whopping trillion tokens across <a href="https://oreil.ly/kBEdY">more than 80 programming languages</a>. They keep things above board with governance, safety, and generally sticking to the rules, training only on code that’s gotten the green light from permissive<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="intellectual property (IP) rights" data-type="indexterm" id="id664"/> licenses<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_opensourceAIsoftwareCodeLlama.05.256.52" data-type="indexterm" id="id665"/>.</p></dd>
