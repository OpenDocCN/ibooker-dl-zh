<h1><span class="label">Chapter 2. </span>User Interface and User Experience Design</h1>

<p>The world of software applications depends on beautiful <em>user interfaces (UI)</em> and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UI (user interface)" data-type="indexterm" id="id269"/>intuitive <em>user experiences (UX)</em>. UI design <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UX (user experience)" data-type="indexterm" id="id270"/>is about how a product looks and how users interact with it visually. It focuses on layout, colors, buttons, typography, and everything that shapes the visual experience of a software product. UX design, on the other hand, is about how a product feels to the user and if it is intuitive and efficient to use. UX is about usability, navigation flow, and making sure the overall experience is smooth and user-friendly. Both work hand in hand to create great software products.</p>

<p>Producing those interfaces and experiences has been the job of UI/UX designers for the last few decades. They usually pair with software engineers to implement the functionality and the backend workflows that bring those designs to life as an integrated experience for users around the world. Transforming UI/UX designs into functional frontend code is a labor-intensive process, though. Traditionally, designers and engineers work closely to ensure that the visual aesthetics of a design are accurately translated into a responsive, interactive user interface. This process often involves multiple iterations, meticulous attention to detail, and a deep understanding of both design principles and coding standards.</p>

<p>Since the emergence of text-to-image generative AI models in 2022 and 2023, UI/UX design has witnessed <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UI/UX" data-secondary="design" data-type="indexterm" id="id271"/>an enormous transformation. As I write this in 2025, recent AI tools can now generate UI designs from ideas described in natural language <em>and</em> generate functional frontend code from UI designs. These tools are revolutionizing the design-to-code workflow by automating significant portions of the process. This has immense potential to reduce the time and effort required to bring designs to life and make design professionals much more efficient. AI tools can significantly reduce the gap between concept and implementation.</p>

<p>For example, the first iteration of wireframing and sketching designs for a new application can take more than a week to complete—sometimes more than a month, depending on the complexity of the project. The new AI design generators can cut wireframing time to less than a day and make each feedback loop faster as well. These tools’ ability to transform designs into functional frontend code means one person or team can go from describing an idea in natural language to generating functional frontend code within minutes (or hours, counting iterations), as opposed to weeks or months.</p>

<p>This chapter will examine some of the leading tools in both the domains of UI design and UX design, aiming to cover the wide range of activities in between.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Types of AI Tools for Design and Frontend Development"><div class="sect1" id="ch02_types_of_ai_tools_for_design_and_frontend_developm_1749441075495901">
<h1>Types of AI Tools for Design and Frontend Development</h1>

<p>Throughout this chapter, I’ll focus on two types of AI tools: those that transform ideas into designs and those that transform designs into code.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Tools that transform ideas into designs</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>This sounds like a UI/UX designer’s job, but think about it: if creating designs becomes easier, faster, and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UI/UX" data-secondary="tools" data-tertiary="design" data-type="indexterm" id="uuxxtl"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UI/UX" data-startref="aituux" id="id272"/>more accessible to people without professional design skills, the average frontend developer will probably be able to create designs <em>and</em> code, as opposed to the current scope of work, which entails only writing code. That translates to massive empowerment for software engineers, especially those working on the frontend, who’ll be able to create basic designs independently.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Tools that transform designs into code</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>This segment complements the tools covered in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_code_generation_and_autocompletion_1749441074605380">Chapter 1</a>, which generate code from a natural-language prompt. The tools here generate code from image-based mockups or <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Figma" data-type="indexterm" id="id273"/>Figma design files. (If you aren’t familiar with it, Figma is for UI/UX designers what Visual Studio Code is for software developers.)</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>Most available UI/UX design generator tools are fully browser- and cloud-based. They are simple to use without complex software installation and are easily accessible with a browser and a URL. Some tools, like <a href="https://qoqo.ai">QoQo.ai</a>, come as plug-ins for design platforms like Figma.</p>

<p>Most of the products this chapter covers have been launched very recently and are in the early stages of product development. They’ll undergo continuous development, rolling out new features and improved functionality in the months and years ahead. As I write this, such design tools are a year or two behind software development tools like <a href="https://oreil.ly/6tmUG">GitHub Copilot</a> in terms of maturity.</p>

<p>I expect that in the UI/UX space we’ll also see more browser-based tools, more add-ons or plug-ins to popular design platforms, and more integration into collaboration tools used between designers and frontend development teams. (The analogous tool to Git might still be Figma for many teams, but for others it might be plug-ins to popular collaboration <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UI/UX" id="aituux"/>tools like Jira or Notion—we’ll see.)</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Pros and Cons of Using AI Tools for UI/UX"><div class="sect1" id="ch02_pros_and_cons_of_using_ui_tools_for_ui_ux_1749441075495961">
<h1>Pros and Cons of Using AI Tools for UI/UX</h1>

<p>Like any tools, the tools in this chapter present <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="pros and cons" data-type="indexterm" id="tlspcyx"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UI/UX" data-secondary="tools" data-tertiary="pros and cons" data-type="indexterm" id="uuxtlbc"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UI/UX" data-tertiary="pros and cons" id="aitprcn"/>advantages and disadvantages. Some of the advantages include:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Efficiency and speed</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>AI tools can process design files and components and generate corresponding code in a fraction of the time it would take a human developer. This rapid turnaround can accelerate project timelines and reduce costs.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Consistency</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>By automating the conversion process, AI tools help maintain consistent implementation of design elements across a project.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Accessibility</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Individuals without technical or design expertise can pick up these tools and create functional interfaces, a shift that helps to democratize UI/UX design.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Prototyping and iteration</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>AI-generated code allows for faster prototyping. Designers and engineers can quickly test and iterate on their ideas to bring new products to market much faster than ever before.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>The drawbacks of the tools discussed in this chapter include:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Code quality</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Code produced by AI tools does not always meet the standards of human-generated code. It can be less efficient and harder to read and maintain, so—as I’ve emphasized throughout this book—developers must look through and revise generated code thoroughly before releasing it into production.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id274-marker" href="ch02.html#id274">1</a></sup></p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Device compatibility</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>AI-generated code may not be fully optimized for all browsers, operating systems, and screen sizes. This can lead to issues with responsiveness and cross-device compatibility that require additional effort to troubleshoot and fix.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Customization and flexibility</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>While AI tools can handle standard design patterns well, they may struggle with more complex, custom design elements. This greatly limits creativity and the ability to tailor the design to specific needs. For this reason, human creativity is still needed.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Lack of originality and uniqueness</dt>
	<dd>
	<p class="fix_tracking">AI tools often produce designs that resemble existing ones. These tools are trained on current designs and prevailing trends, which can lead to a lack of originality and distinctiveness, with some designs appearing generic or repetitive and failing to stand out. Although AI tools can offer a useful starting point or inspiration, they’re far from matching the creative capabilities of a talented human designer.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>Striking the right balance between leveraging AI for automation and relying on human talent for quality and creativity is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="pros and cons" data-type="indexterm" data-startref="tlspcyx" id="id275"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UI/UX" data-secondary="tools" data-tertiary="pros and cons" data-type="indexterm" data-startref="uuxtlbc" id="id276"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UI/UX" data-tertiary="pros and cons" data-startref="aitprcn" id="id277"/>key to successfully integrating these tools into the design workflow.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Use Cases for UI/UX AI Tools"><div class="sect1" id="ch02_use_cases_for_ui_ux_ai_tools_1749441075496016">
<h1>Use Cases for UI/UX AI Tools</h1>

<p>UI/UX design-assistant tools aid different parts <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="use cases" data-type="indexterm" id="tlauscs"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UI/UX" data-secondary="tools" data-tertiary="use cases" data-type="indexterm" id="uxascss"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UI/UX" data-tertiary="use cases" id="atuuxuss"/>of the design process. They can be categorized as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Design ideation assistants</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>User research and analysis tools</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Color palette and style generators</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Layout and component generators</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Accessibility checkers</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Personalization engines</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Voice-user interface (VUI) designers</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Gesture and motion design tools</p>

	<li>
	<p>Wireframing and prototyping tools</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Design-to-code converters</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This chapter focuses on the last two items, which lie at the intersection of UI and frontend code and are thus of most interest to software engineers. Other tools that target specific parts of the UX and product research workflows are usually more specific to designers and other roles that collaborate more loosely with software developers, like product managers, product analysts, and UX researchers.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before less_space">Thus, I evaluate the tools in this chapter using the following use cases:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Rapid prototyping</dt>
	<dd>
	<p class="fix_tracking">AI tools can quickly generate wireframes <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="prototyping" data-secondary="rapid" id="id278"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="rapid prototyping" id="id279"/>and prototypes based on initial inputs and design descriptions. This is a major chunk of the design process, where designers spend hours in back-and-forth iterations. With these tools, creating prototypes is much faster and designers can iterate multiple design options quickly. This flexibility can also make sophisticated flows such as A/B testing much more accessible.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Designing from templates</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>AI tools can be trained on design principles like components, colors, and styles, to ensure <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="design" data-secondary="templates and" id="id280"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="templates, design and" id="id281"/>consistency across different parts of a product by generating designs that adhere to established design systems, branding, and guidelines. This results in a cohesive user experience with uniform design elements and styles throughout the application. While this “factory” approach doesn’t foster creativity, it does bring significant value for use cases where all you need is to create new screens that look like the existing ones but fulfill new functionality. (In all honesty, for better or worse, most software development consists of this “factory” approach, as proven by the growing popularity of low-code and no-code tools.)</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Accessibility assessments</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>AI tools can automatically <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="accessibility assessments" id="id282"/>check and improve the accessibility of UI designs for people with disabilities, ensuring compliance with standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and inclusive design practices—much as the tools covered in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03_bug_detection_and_code_review_1749441076008122">Chapter 3</a> do for software code. Such features can identify accessibility issues and suggest fixes, reducing the manual effort required.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>User research and personalization</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>AI UI/UX design tools can <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="user research" id="id283"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="personalization" id="id284"/>analyze user data about behavior, needs, and preferences to tailor their output to specific user groups or individuals, improving engagement, retention, and satisfaction. By leveraging data-driven insights, these tools ensure user-centered design. This can massively extend existing use cases. For example, if the goal is to create new landing pages for specific customer demographics, with these tools you could create full product variations according to specific parameters. Without them, each product variation would require a heavy software development cycle.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Content generation</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>AI tools assist in generating <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="content generation" id="id285"/>content for UI elements, such as placeholder text, images, and icons. This quickly populates designs with realistic content, making prototypes more lifelike for testing and ensuring consistency with the design’s style and tone. This frees designers to <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="use cases" data-type="indexterm" data-startref="tlauscs" id="id286"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UI/UX" data-secondary="tools" data-tertiary="use cases" data-type="indexterm" data-startref="uxascss" id="id287"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UI/UX" data-tertiary="use cases" data-startref="atuuxuss" id="id288"/>focus on the more creative aspects of the process.</p>

<h1 class="less_space">Evaluation Process</h1>

<p>My process in this chapter <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="evaluation" data-type="indexterm" id="tlavlt"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UI/UX" data-secondary="tools" data-tertiary="evaluation" data-type="indexterm" id="uuxavlt"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UI/UX" data-tertiary="evaluation" id="atuuxvlat"/>was as follows: I submitted a brief design prompt to each of the selected UI design tools, ran the same challenge on each tool, and compared their output. I also evaluated their ability to convert the designs they generate into frontend HTML CSS, Next.js, and React code. I reviewed 20+ tools available in the market. As expected, they followed a long-tail distribution: a few worked as advertised, while others delivered poor output or had different issues that prevented me from running the test. Many tools in the AI space were developed by startups whose products are in very early stages of development.</p>

<p>After trying the tools, I selected the best four in each category that provided actual value for the use cases tested. I then rated each tool on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being the worst (a solution that errors out and doesn’t run at all), 10 being flawless, and 5 being a design that didn’t exactly fit the requirements. I look closely at the top product in each category, detailing its pros and cons, then provide more concise information on the runner-up.</p>

<p>It’s also important to note that all tests described in this chapter were run in spring 2025. Given the fast pace of evolution of each of these tools and their underlying models, it’s likely that you <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UI/UX" data-tertiary="evaluation" data-startref="atuuxvlat" id="id289"/>could get a different result at a later time for the same prompt.</p>

<h1>UI Tools</h1>

<p>I asked each of the AI tools covered in this chapter to generate screen designs for a mobile food delivery application. Here is the detailed prompt I provided:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
Create a user-friendly food delivery app that allows customers to browse 
local restaurants, view menus, place orders, and track delivery status 
in real-time. The app should include these screens: Login, Restaurant 
and Menu Browsing, Order Placement, and Tracking. 
 
Style: App should be modern and minimalist, focusing on ease of use and 
visual appeal. The design should incorporate a clean layout. Add in 
mouth-watering food images.</pre>

<p>Let’s see how the tools did.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" class="pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="Uizard"><div class="sect2" id="ch02_uizard_1749441075496167">
<h2 class="less_space">Uizard</h2>

<p><a href="https://uizard.io">Uizard</a> has a marketing slogan that I believe sets the standard for most other players <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UI (user interface)" data-secondary="tools" data-tertiary="Uizard" data-type="indexterm" id="uiuauz"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UI (user interface)" data-tertiary="Uizard" id="aiuiuizrd"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="screen design" data-secondary="UI tools" data-tertiary="Uizard" id="scduituz"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Uizard" id="uzrdia"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="design" data-secondary="screen design" data-tertiary="UI tools" id="dsscduit"/>in this space: “Forget no-code, here comes no-design.” The analogy between code automation and design automation makes a lot of sense. Just as no-code has promised the same functionality in a fraction of the time and budget, no-design could have an equal impact on the design process.</p>

<p>The Uizard product started as a machine learning research project called pix2code in 2017 in Copenhagen, Denmark. According to <a href="https://oreil.ly/Yeeio">Uizard’s marketing collateral</a>, “It allows developers to visualize product ideas quickly and easily with AI. This helps to fast-track the workflow of designers and software developers. Its mission is to democratize design and empower non-designers everywhere to build digital, interactive products.”</p>

<p>At the prompt screen (<a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_1_1749441075489200">Figure 2-1</a>), I asked Uizard to generate screens for a food delivery app using the prompt from the preceding section.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-2. </span>Screens generated by Uizard (11 in total)</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>You can see all of the screens it generated, along with the interactions, as previews on <a href="https://oreil.ly/GfXvV">Uizard’s site</a>.</p>

<p>One of Uizard’s unique features is that it creates an interactive demo of the designs, with actual interactions and transitions between screens. This makes it a go-to website for transforming an idea into a demonstrable concept, even before writing any code. On the other hand, Uizard doesn’t generate code to the level of other tools in this space, such as Bolt.new or Lovable, which generate working code alongside the designs and make it easy to commit the code to GitHub and even to deploy the working app right away.</p>

<p>I rate Uizard an 8 out of 10. Its design component is very competent, but it falls short in <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UI (user interface)" data-secondary="tools" data-tertiary="Uizard" data-type="indexterm" data-startref="uiuauz" id="id290"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UI (user interface)" data-tertiary="Uizard" data-startref="aiuiuizrd" id="id291"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="screen design" data-secondary="UI tools" data-tertiary="Uizard" data-startref="scduituz" id="id292"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Uizard" data-startref="uzrdia" id="id293"/>generating working code.</p>

<h2>Bolt.new</h2>

<p class="fix_tracking"><a href="http://bolt.new">Bolt.new</a> is a browser-based, AI-powered development tool launched <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UI (user interface)" data-secondary="tools" data-tertiary="Bolt.new" data-type="indexterm" id="uiuabltw"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UI (user interface)" data-tertiary="Bolt.new" id="aiuibltnw"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="screen design" data-secondary="UI tools" data-tertiary="Bolt.new" id="scduibltwo"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Bolt.new" id="bltnewe"/>in October 2024 by StackBlitz. It enables users, including those without technical skills, to create frontend web and mobile applications using natural-language prompts. By integrating technologies like WebContainers, Supabase, and Netlify, Bolt.new allows for seamless code generation, authentication, and deployment directly from the browser. This approach simplifies the development process, making it accessible to a broader audience.​</p>

<p>The platform has experienced rapid growth, achieving $20 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) within two months of launch and reaching $40 million ARR by February 2025.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id294-marker" href="ch02.html#id294">2</a></sup> With over three million registered users and one million monthly active users, Bolt.new has become one of the fastest-growing AI tools in history. Its success is attributed to its user-friendly interface, efficient development workflow, and the ability to swiftly transform ideas into functional applications.</p>

<p>I gave the same prompt to Bolt.new, and it generated the app designs seen in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_3_1749441075489250">Figure 2-3</a>.</p>



<p>The screens generated are very solid, with the pages, navigation, and hierarchy I’d expect in such an application. It generated realistic mock text and images for each screen, making them look good. There’s an obvious glitch in the footer, with both missing icon images and creeping navigation, but other than that the designs are very good.</p>

<p>What’s best about Bolt.new is that it can help <em>beyond</em> generating designs from a natural-language prompt: it also generates the underlying code. In this case, it generated frontend code in TypeScript.</p>

<p><a href="https://lovable.dev">Lovable</a> is a browser-based AI development platform launched in November 2024 by the Swedish startup of the same name. It empowers users, both technical <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UI (user interface)" data-secondary="tools" data-tertiary="Lovable" data-type="indexterm" id="uiualbvle"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UI (user interface)" data-tertiary="Lovable" id="aiuilvblab"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="screen design" data-secondary="UI tools" data-tertiary="Lovable" id="scduilvable"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Lovable" id="lvblova"/>and nontechnical, to build full stack web apps using natural-language prompts. By combining tools like Supabase for backend services and GitHub for version control, Lovable automates everything from database setup to deployment. The result is a dramatically simplified development experience, allowing anyone with an idea to launch functional software directly from their browser.</p>

<p class="fix_tracking">In just three months, Lovable reached $17 million in ARR and attracted over 30,000 paying subscribers. With more than 50,000 new projects started each day, it’s one of the fastest-growing AI dev tools to date.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id299-marker" href="ch02.html#id299">3</a></sup> Much of its momentum comes from its intuitive interface and ability to abstract away the traditional complexity of software development, making the field—especially frontend interfaces—more accessible than ever.</p>

<p>I gave the same prompt for the food delivery app, and Lovable generated the app designs shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_5_1749441075489282">Figure 2-5</a>.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-5. </span>Screens generated by Lovable</h6>
</div></figure>

<p class="fix_tracking">Very similar to Bolt.new, Lovable has a chatbot UI on the left side of the screen, allowing the user to prompt with natural language for new screens, changes, fixes, etc. It also has a toggle on the top to switch between preview and “Dev mode.” The preview mode shows the generated designs, as seen in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_5_1749441075489282">Figure 2-5</a>, while Dev mode shows the code produced. On the top, there are buttons that allow users to easily sync the code with GitHub or deploy the app.</p>

<p>I also rate Lovable a 10 out of 10. I think it’s the leading player in this space alongside Bolt.new. Both fulfill the use case of getting professional designs and working code from a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UI (user interface)" data-secondary="tools" data-tertiary="Lovable" data-type="indexterm" data-startref="uiualbvle" id="id300"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UI (user interface)" data-tertiary="Lovable" data-startref="aiuilvblab" id="id301"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="screen design" data-secondary="UI tools" data-tertiary="Lovable" data-startref="scduilvable" id="id302"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Lovable" data-startref="lvblova" id="id303"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="design" data-secondary="screen design" data-tertiary="UI tools" data-startref="dsscduit" id="id304"/>natural-language prompt.</p>

<h1>UX Tools</h1>

<p>In this short section, I cover tools for the UX part of the UI/UX design workflow: user research, product workflows, and usability.</p>

<p>Here is the prompt I used for evaluating UX tools:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
Create a user persona for an 18-25-year-old university student trying 
to order food online from a restaurant using our application. 
 
Description: 18-25, Female, Male, University undergraduate from 
Los Angeles, California, single, and no children. Looking for a 
user-friendly platform to order food very fast, track orders, and 
make payments</pre>

<h2>QoQo.ai</h2>

<p><a href="http://qoqo.ai">QoQo.ai</a> (pronounced “cocoa”) is an AI-for-UX-design Figma plug-in that helps in <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UX (user experience)" data-secondary="tools" data-tertiary="QoQo.ai" data-type="indexterm" id="uiualqqai"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UX (user experience)" data-tertiary="QoQo.ai" id="aiuiloqoqai"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="screen design" data-secondary="UX tools" data-tertiary="QoQo.ai" id="scduiqqooai"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="QoQo.ai" id="qoqoiaia"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="design" data-secondary="screen design" data-tertiary="UX tools" id="dsgdgux"/>the early stages of design. Designers can use it to generate UX personas, journey maps, site maps, and UX copywriting. UI/UX designers, product managers, and product researchers, who usually do these tasks, will save time with this tool; it can also make these tasks more accessible to software engineers, helping them better engage with users.</p>

<p>I provided QoQo with the preceding prompt, and within seconds the AI generated a detailed user persona (shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_6_1749441075489296">Figure 2-6</a>).</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-6. </span>QoQo user persona</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>I rate QoQo an 8 out of 10. It gets the job done, and there is really no learning curve involved. It does feel like a GPT wrapper, in the sense that it’s generating text and placing it into predefined brackets, which can provide tremendous value if you are starting <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UX (user experience)" data-secondary="tools" data-tertiary="QoQo.ai" data-type="indexterm" data-startref="uiualqqai" id="id305"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UX (user experience)" data-tertiary="QoQo.ai" data-startref="aiuiloqoqai" id="id306"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="screen design" data-secondary="UX tools" data-tertiary="QoQo.ai" data-startref="scduiqqooai" id="id307"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="QoQo.ai" data-startref="qoqoiaia" id="id308"/>to design the UI/UX of a software product.</p>

<h2>Research Studio</h2>

<p><a href="https://researchstudio.ai">Research Studio</a> is an AI-powered application designed to automate the customer and user research analysis process. This tool is particularly <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UX (user experience)" data-secondary="tools" data-tertiary="Research Studio" data-type="indexterm" id="uiualrsrstd"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UX (user experience)" data-tertiary="Research Studio" id="aiuilorserstd"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="screen design" data-secondary="UX tools" data-tertiary="Research Studio" id="scduiRsrStd"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Research Studio" id="RsrchStdoi"/>useful for researchers and designers who need to transform user interviews into actionable insights, analyze satisfaction, and generate branded reports swiftly. Traditionally, UX researchers spend hours combing through vast amounts of data to extract insights. Research Studio streamlines this process, making it faster and more efficient.</p>

<p>Research Studio’s platform allows you to choose between three open source LLMs: Claude AI, Mistral, or OpenAI’s GPT-4o. You upload your user interviews and it extracts insights into a report. It can also use the information it has garnered from the interviews and data to write a report. Several report types are available as outputs, including user flows, feature maps, and question analysis.</p>

<p>To evaluate this tool, I used Claude AI (separately) to generate some raw input. I asked it to generate 50 survey responses from users of our dummy food-delivery app, using the following prompt:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
Generate 50 survey responses from users of a food delivery app, reflecting their
thoughts after using the app for some time. The responses should highlight both 
positive and negative views, including any problems they faced and suggestions 
for features that could improve the app's efficiency and user experience.</pre>

<p>These responses included both positive and negative feedback, as well as suggestions for improvements. Here are a few examples from <a href="https://oreil.ly/2zbPd">Claude’s output</a>:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
1. "The app is fast and easy to use. Love the variety of restaurants!"
 
2. "Delivery times are often longer than estimated. Please improve accuracy."
 
3. "I wish there was an option to schedule orders in advance."
 
4. "The customer service is excellent, always helpful when I have issues."</pre>

<p>I passed the responses into Research Studio to extract insights (<a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_7_1749441075489320">Figure 2-7</a>) and asked it to write a comprehensive report based on its built-in report types (<a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_8_1749441075489339">Figure 2-8</a>).</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-8. </span>An insight map generated by Research Studio from survey responses</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>I rate Research Studio a 7 out of 10. While it feels like a simple LLM wrapper, it does a good job with the workflow, and it does deliver value for anyone who wants to crunch massive amounts of data into structured product insights to use in their next software-development <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UX (user experience)" data-secondary="tools" data-tertiary="Research Studio" data-type="indexterm" data-startref="uiualrsrstd" id="id309"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tools" data-secondary="UX (user experience)" data-tertiary="Research Studio" data-startref="aiuilorserstd" id="id310"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="screen design" data-secondary="UX tools" data-tertiary="Research Studio" data-startref="scduiRsrStd" id="id311"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Research Studio" data-startref="RsrchStdoi" id="id312"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="design" data-secondary="screen design" data-tertiary="UX tools" data-startref="dsgdgux" id="id313"/>iteration.</p>

<h1>Tool Comparison</h1>

<p>Galileo AI emerged from my evaluation as the best text-to-UI tool among the 20+ tools I evaluated, including the four featured in this chapter. Its ability to take an image and remake it into a beautiful design also makes it stand out. As I’ve noted, this space is still in its very early days, so I can only imagine how far these tools will evolve in the coming years.</p>

<p>The UX tools I evaluated are less complex in terms of underlying technology, but that’s not a critique: they worked well enough for their use cases.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>I began writing this chapter with the wrong expectations. I didn’t expect the tools in this space to be very useful in their current state, given their newness. I was wrong. I’m now very excited about this space and the evolution in software development processes we’ll see in the coming months and years.</p>

<p>Generating frontend code from designs, with the increasingly dominant use case of generating both design and working code from a prompt (as seen in Bolt.new and Lovable), is certainly the angle that best speaks to software engineers, especially those working on the frontend. It is a game-changer that will save software engineers around the world millions of hours.</p>

<p>The other use cases seem to cater less to software engineers, as they are designers’ work. But think about it: our tools are becoming more powerful, and if it takes less time to do the same work, software engineers can manage a larger portion of design workflows. Indeed, our employers and team leads will likely ask us to do so more and more.</p>

<p>These tools make software engineers capable of producing working designs, and given the staggering pace of their development, I can foresee that many teams will no longer need specialized designers to produce lots of screens. Of course, specialized interactions, branded UI elements, or complex user-experience nuances will still be best served by specialized human UI/UX designers. But I can imagine that most standard app flows, such as registration flows, listings, and profile pages, will be well served by these AI tools.</p>

<p>Never before have software engineers been so empowered to collect feedback from the users of their products, structure that feedback into actionable insights, generate improved designs, transform them into code, and push a new iteration to production. Product iteration cycles will shorten significantly thanks to these tools. Professionals who master them will have much more market demand than those who stick to only writing code. As I write these lines in early 2025, I’m seeing big growth in the Product Engineer job title in recent months, which caters exactly to this opportunity I’m describing: software engineers who can understand the client’s needs, convert them into product feature descriptions, and ship the code that fulfils those descriptions.</p>
