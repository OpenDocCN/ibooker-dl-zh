   <p>A web interface is sufficient to use language models on small pieces of data. But how can we scale it up to large data sets?</p>

   <p>In chapter 3, we look at OpenAI’s Python library, a powerful library that enables you to call language models directly from Python. We discuss the most important library functions, including various parameters that can be used to fine-tune the behavior of the language model for your specific use case.</p>

   <p>Chapter 4 discusses several mini-projects that use OpenAI’s language models via the Python library to analyze collections of text documents. For instance, our projects cover classifying text documents into one of several prespecified categories, extracting specific snippets of information from text, and clustering similar text documents together. <span id="DataAnalysis"/></p>

   <p>Chapter 5 shows how to use language models to analyze structured data: data tables and graph data. Here, language models are used as an interface, translating questions about the data (in natural language) into formal queries that can be processed by specialized analysis tools. For instance, the chapter demonstrates how to use language models to build interfaces that translate questions to queries in SQL that can be processed using relational database management systems.</p>

   <p>Chapter 6 demonstrates how language models can analyze pictures and even videos. The sample projects include using language models to answer arbitrary questions in natural language about pictures, as well as finding pairs of pictures showing the same person. This chapter also shows how to use language models to automatically caption videos based on the video content.</p>

   <p>Chapter 7 focuses on audio data and covers speech transcription as well as speech generation. For instance, we see how to use OpenAI’s models to build a voice query interface, answering spoken questions about tabular data. We also build a translation tool, translating spoken input in a first language into spoken output in a second language according to user specifications.</p>
