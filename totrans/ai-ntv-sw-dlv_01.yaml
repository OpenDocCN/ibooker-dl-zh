- en: 'Here’s one: After weeks or months of feature work, extensive refactoring, and
    a long testing and stabilization phase, a team is ready to deploy. Developers,
    operations team members, a coterie of managers, and maybe a number of executives
    gather in a “war room.” Up to this point, there has been minimal collaboration
    between development and operations. However, now these two groups are working
    together as a single team. They start ticking through a long checklist or playbook
    of manual steps.'

  zh: 这里有一个例子：经过几周或几个月的功能工作、广泛的重构以及漫长的测试和稳定阶段后，一个团队准备进行部署。开发者、运维团队成员、一群管理者，也许还有几位高管聚集在一个“作战室”中。到目前为止，开发和运维之间几乎没有协作。然而，现在这两个团队作为一个单一团队一起工作。他们开始逐项检查一个长长的清单或操作手册中的手动步骤。
- en: However, even exhaustive checklists do not guarantee a problem-free deployment.
    Given the number of changes in the release, the deployment is likely complex and
    risky. As we will see in the following chapters, dependency management is challenging
    and “dependency hell” can be very real. So, the team might find that a key dependency
    was missing from the production environment. The team might discover that an incompatible
    library version was installed, or that a critical setting was misconfigured, or
    that a migration step fails or is forgotten, or that changes have caused requests
    to a partner service to fail.

  zh: 然而，即使是最详尽的清单也无法保证部署无问题。鉴于发布中的变更数量，部署可能很复杂且风险很高。正如我们将在以下章节中看到的，依赖关系管理具有挑战性，“依赖地狱”可能非常真实。因此，团队可能会发现生产环境中缺少一个关键依赖项。团队可能会发现安装了不兼容的库版本，或者关键设置配置错误，或者迁移步骤失败或被遗忘，或者更改导致对合作伙伴服务的请求失败。
- en: Any number of missteps could take an already complex deployment off track. Tensions
    would rise, firefighting would ensue, and the hours would stretch on. The team
    would hope to wrap up deployment and any subsequent manual smoke testing within
    the deployment window. If the deployment failed irreparably and could not be salvaged,
    the team would hope that a rollback to the previous version would not result in
    unexpected difficulties, extending downtime and complexity. When the deployment
    is finally complete, the exhausted team retreats. Often the team would be expected
    to be vigilant as traffic resumed for the span of a “critical care period.” A
    stabilization period of a few days or weeks might follow in which the development
    team might pause all feature work to focus on hotfixes or patches.

  zh: 任何数量的失误都可能导致原本复杂的部署偏离轨道。紧张局势会升级，紧急应对措施随之而来，时间也会无限延长。团队希望能在部署窗口内完成部署以及随后的任何手动烟雾测试。如果部署失败且无法修复，团队希望回滚到上一个版本不会导致意外的困难，从而延长停机时间和复杂性。当部署最终完成时，疲惫的团队会撤退。通常，团队在流量恢复的“关键护理期”内会被期望保持警惕。之后可能会有一段为期几天或几周的稳定期，在此期间，开发团队可能会暂停所有功能工作，专注于热修复或补丁。
- en: As this story illustrates, heavy-lift, high-stakes deployments were draining
    for both the development and operations teams. These big-production deployments,
    followed by cycles of stabilization work, distracted teams from continuing to
    build features that added business value.

    new ideas about how to make software delivery more efficient. New “Agile” methodologies
    that built on lean manufacturing ideas became popular. These methodologies argued
    against “waterfall” software delivery patterns that emphasized extensive up-front
    planning and a strictly linear sequence of distinct phases. In contrast, Agile
    promoted short development cycles and frequent releases that were highly responsive
    to change. Many parallel efforts formalized new Agile practices. A 1995 paper
    formalized Scrum practices. Kent Beck described a set of Agile practices for software
    development in his 1999 book *Extreme Programming Explained* (Addison-Wesley).
    In 2001, Beck and other influential advocates of Agile processes spoke to similar
    themes in the Agile Manifesto, which promoted adaptability and responsiveness
    over rigid adherence to plans.^([1](ch01.html#id309)) DevOps borrows the name
    “continuous delivery” from the manifesto’s first principle: “Our highest priority
    is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.”'

    from 2001 to 2007 serves as a kind of barometer for Agile’s increasing maturity
    and organizational reach. During this time, Scrum was rapidly emerging as the
    dominant Agile practice, thanks to its clear structure, prescriptive roles, and
    adaptability across teams. In 2001, *Agile Software Development with Scrum* (Pearson)
    introduced the framework to developers and small teams just beginning to explore
    Agile methods. By 2004, *Agile Project Management with Scrum* (Addison-Wesley)
    addressed practical implementation challenges, signaling growing adoption across
    broader swaths of IT. By 2007, *The Enterprise and Scrum* (Microsoft Press) acknowledged
    the growing demand for scaling Agile practices beyond individual teams to entire
    organizations. These books reflected—and helped shape—the journey of Agile from
    fringe idea to enterprise imperative.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The “Manifesto for Agile Software Development” gave rise to the practice of
    continuous integration, which enables a key agile tenet, the frequent delivery
    of working software. Developers merge their code changes into a shared repository.
    With continuous integration, each merge triggers an automated build and testing
    process. This automated system quickly catches errors and conflicts, allowing
    teams to fix them early in the development cycle. Continuous integration encourages
    smaller, more frequent updates, leading to faster delivery, reduced integration
    issues, and a healthier codebase.

    the process of taking code that has passed the integration build and testing and

    teams to push new features, bug fixes, and updates rapidly and reliably, ensuring

    this, the complexity of managing infrastructure and applications made widespread
    adoption of DevOps challenging. The launch of AWS Lambda in 2014 further transformed
    the landscape by pioneering event-driven function execution at scale, allowing
    developers to focus on writing code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

    Relic were early to brand themselves “AI Ops” as they used ML to identify problematic
    signals. By 2018, [Harness applied ML to continuous delivery](https://oreil.ly/4BH7E)
    to detect problematic signals, enabling the system to identify when deployments
    caused issues and trigger necessary rollbacks. Together, these technologies laid
    the groundwork for modern DevOps by providing the necessary tools and frameworks
    to manage complex software systems efficiently, paving the way for AI-native DevOps.

    to minimize risk. As organizations began embracing early DevOps principles—bringing
    development and operations teams closer together and automating key parts of the
    delivery pipeline—they achieved faster release cycles, greater reliability, and
    reduced manual effort. For many, the shift enabled a move from quarterly to biweekly
    or even weekly releases, setting the stage for more iterative development and

- en: A team using automated scripts for most of the deployment but requiring manual
    intervention to configure environment variables can lead to inconsistent deployments
    if not all team members follow the same procedure. Incomplete automation can lead
    to gaps in monitoring and feedback loops, as manual steps might not trigger automated
    alerts or metrics collection. Manual steps introduce the risk of human error,
    which can lead to downtime or security breaches. Thus, incomplete automation in
    DevOps can lead to inefficiencies, errors, and scalability issues.

    as meeting General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR] standards), leading to costly
    rework or fines when issues are discovered later. If security measures are applied
    inconsistently or as an afterthought, applications are left vulnerable to attacks.
    Without clear governance policies, resources such as cloud services or infrastructure
    might be overprovisioned or underutilized, leading to wasted costs (a topic we’ll
    cover in [Chapter 9](ch09.html#chapter_9_ai_and_automation_for_cloud_cost_management_1749354011360525)).

  zh: 摘要
- en: Modern software delivery emphasizes rapid releases, seamless experiences, and
    constant innovation, driving a need to transform traditional DevOps practices.
    While DevOps 1.0 laid the groundwork with CI/CD and initial cross-team collaboration,
    its reliance on complex toolchains built from disparate solutions creates hurdles.
    These challenges stem from the growing architectural complexity of applications
    (microservices, containers), the proliferation of open source components, and
    the need to manage increasingly diverse toolsets. DevOps 2.0 aims to address these
    issues by simplifying the developer experience, offering more integrated and intelligent
    toolsets, and infusing AI natively throughout the pipeline. This evolution promises
    greater efficiency, enhanced quality, and a focus on delivering value rather than
    just managing tools.
