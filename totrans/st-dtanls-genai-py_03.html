  <div class="readable-text" id="p6"> &#13;
   <p>In the previous chapter, you performed a number of descriptive analyses and ended up with quite a few charts and some statistical modeling parameters. Yay! You can now bag it all and send it to your boss, right? Maybe . . . Depends on your boss, really. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p7"> &#13;
   <p>In your work, you may encounter different types of managers. Some will be really well-versed in analytics themselves, and you’ll be cooperating with them, learning a ton of useful stuff. They will accept your results and discuss assumptions and methods with you; they may ask you to do some analytics neither you nor your generative AI advisor expected in this context. All will be good. The kind of boss you need to be wary of is the type with an overinflated opinion about their analytical skills. We won’t dwell on this type, as dealing with these people is a matter of psychology, rather than data analytics. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p8"> &#13;
   <p>The type relevant for this chapter are bosses who expect you not only to provide the results, but also to propose the interpretation. Some of them overlap with the first category we mentioned, and they want to help you understand the business better and grow as analysts. Others are too busy to be bothered with the trivial task of drawing business-critical conclusions. There is also a chance that you will be analyzing data for your own business (in this undoubtedly short period when your company won’t be able to hire dedicated analysts). </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p9"> &#13;
   <p>Regardless of the reason, you may find yourself in a situation where you’ll be scratching your head over the charts you prepared. To derive the most business value, you need to ensure that your interpretation of results is</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p10"> <em>Holistic</em><em> </em>—When interpreting results, it’s important to look at the big picture. Make sure your conclusions from one set of data don’t clash with those from another. Consider all your findings together to get a full understanding of what the data is telling you. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p11"> <em>Precise</em><em> </em>—Be careful not to stretch your interpretations beyond what the data actually shows. Stick to the facts and avoid making assumptions that the data doesn’t support. Remember, being accurate is more important than making the data seem more exciting or significant than it really is. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p12"> <em>Well-communicated</em><em> </em>—Make sure you explain your findings in a way that everyone can understand, whether they’re a data expert or not. Use clear and simple language and visuals to share your insights. It’s all about making sure your audience can easily grasp and act on the information you provide. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p13"> &#13;
   <p>Regarding the last point, you may be required to engage in some form of storytelling. (You can learn more about AI-powered storytelling from another excellent Manning book, aptly named <em>Data Storytelling with Generative AI</em>, by Angelica Lo Duca.) The narrative-building skills are beyond the scope of this book, but in the other two aspects of your interpretation, generative AI can help you. This chapter will cover how to get helpful advice, from interpreting charts to enhancing results with a meaningful business context. </p> &#13;

   <h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_49"><span class="num-string">4.1</span> Problem definition </h2> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p15"> &#13;
   <p>In previous chapters, we asked our generative AI advisor about the structure of the analytical process and about its implementation details, including writing the code. We then put real-life business data through the pipeline we created and got a handful of results. However, there is currently one big limitation of utilizing generative AIs for interpreting results: most of our results are in graphical format, while the large language models (LLMs) discussed here are, as the name suggests, language models, and as such excel at text-oriented tasks. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p16"> &#13;
   <p>Multimodal generative AIs allow you to upload your images for analysis. However, we have discovered that the precision required to register visually minute differences between bar heights, for example, isn’t there yet. We will be limited to describing the generated charts and asking for help in their interpretation. If we want to fully utilize generative AI’s power, we need to provide our AI advisor with a proper context. </p> &#13;

   <p>All the models we tested reacted with unwavering enthusiasm and tried to manage expectations, explaining what we can derive from different analyses and warned that due to the limited ability to pass precise results, we should take their opinions with a pinch of salt. Great suggestion, if we ever heard one! </p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p23"> &#13;
   <p>In section 3.3 of the previous chapter, you generated visualizations showing the breakdown of sales volume by state and product category. Let’s look again at the revenue heatmap from figure 3.3, presented here as figure 4.1.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p24">  &#13;

   <h5 class="figure-container-h5 sigil_not_in_toc"><span class="num-string">Figure 4.1</span> Heatmap of sales volume by product category and state</h5>&#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p25"> &#13;
   <p>We can see that there are differences between states and product categories. Before we describe what we see to our AI advisor and check if it can provide any advice in return, let’s talk about the usefulness of heatmaps for business decision-making. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p26"> &#13;
   <p>People, in general, have a pretty weak visual memory. That is the main reason why we repeated this image instead of just reminding you of its number in the previous chapter, or even just describing it. For that reason, it is really hard to compare multiple disconnected charts. Before you turn your attention to a new visualization, the old one starts to fade from your memory. It is of great importance to put all the relevant data in a decision-maker’s field of view. That is the reason behind the (deserved) popularity of all flavors of dashboards. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p27"> &#13;
   <p>Heatmaps put hundreds of data points related to relations between categories into your field of view. However, the idea is not to go one-by-one. You can, of course, do that if you wish. But before getting into the fine details, you may want to take a broader look and search for certain patterns: </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p28"> <em>Points of high performance (single cells of exceptionally high value)</em><em> </em>—Identifying points of high performance through heatmaps enables the discovery of regions where specific product categories excel, highlighting a strong alignment between consumer demand and product offerings. For example, the robust sales of gifts and watches in affluent regions may reflect a high-income consumer base with a preference for luxury items, while the widespread use of mobile internet among younger demographics could indicate a prime market for electronic devices. Such insights are invaluable for businesses looking to refine their strategies. Recommendations might include expanding the luxury product portfolio in affluent areas to tap into the high-income market or launching targeted marketing campaigns aimed at young consumers to enhance the visibility and appeal of tech gadgets. By leveraging data to pinpoint areas of exceptional fit between products and consumer segments, businesses can craft targeted strategies that capitalize on these opportunities, driving sales and fostering growth. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p29"> <em>Points of low performance (single cells of exceptionally low values)</em><em> </em>—Identifying points of low performance on heatmaps can reveal where certain product categories underperform in specific regions, signaling a mismatch between offerings and local market needs or preferences. For instance, the struggle of high-end electronics in rural areas might suggest a gap between product pricing and local purchasing power, while low engagement with online education platforms among older demographics could indicate barriers such as digital literacy or accessibility. On the basis of these insights, businesses should consider diversifying their product range or developing targeted initiatives, like outreach programs, to better engage these underrepresented consumer segments and enhance overall market performance. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p30"> <em>Unique category performance (lower or higher category performance across multiple cross-categories)</em><em> </em>—Trends of over- or underperformance that emerge across multiple cross-categories (e.g., a region of higher performance across multiple product categories) can offer a broad view of market dynamics, including economic factors or cultural influences shaping consumer behavior. For example, the consistent demand for outdoor and fitness products in coastal regions reflects a lifestyle preference, whereas the popularity of educational materials in areas with numerous educational institutions might highlight a community’s educational values. Recognizing these patterns enables businesses to fine-tune their inventory and marketing strategies, such as introducing a wider variety of lifestyle products in coastal areas or engaging in collaborative marketing with educational institutions in academic hubs, thereby leveraging regional strengths to boost sales and customer engagement. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p31"> <em>Emerging hotspots (cells that become high-value over time)</em><em> </em>—The concept of emerging hotspots, where specific regions begin showing increased sales for certain product categories over time, highlights areas of growing market opportunity. This trend, best observed by comparing heatmaps across different time periods, indicates shifts in consumer needs or interests. A notable increase in home office equipment sales in suburban areas could reflect an adaptation to remote work trends, while a surge in health and wellness products in cities may point to a rising health consciousness among urbanites. Businesses that quickly adapt to these trends by stocking up on in-demand products and creating targeted marketing campaigns can seize growth opportunities, establishing a strong presence in emerging markets. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p32"> <em>Seasonal shifts (variations in patterns at different times of the year)</em><em> </em>—Seasonal shifts in product popularity, discernible through the analysis of heatmaps across various times of the year, underscore the influence of factors like weather, holidays, or academic calendars on consumer purchasing behavior. The spike in air conditioning unit and beachwear sales during the summer in warmer regions, or the increased demand for stationery and educational books during back-to-school seasons, exemplifies how seasonality affects shopping patterns. Aligning inventory planning and promotional activities with these seasonal trends is essential for businesses. Anticipating and responding to seasonal demand ensures that businesses can capture the peak sales potential, optimizing revenue generation throughout the year. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p33"> &#13;
   <p>By identifying these insights and offering them as a foundation of strategic decision-making, you can help your business better align its product offerings, marketing efforts, and inventory management with regional consumer behaviors and market dynamics or enhance customer engagement through personalized experiences, optimize supply chain efficiency to reduce overhead costs, foster innovation in product development by identifying unmet needs, and drive sustainable growth by entering new markets with confidence.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p34"> &#13;
   <p>The key to success, however, is not only to notice <em>what</em> happens but to understand <em>why</em>. Let’s try to inquire if generative AI advisors are capable of helping us interpret our Brazilian e-commerce-derived heatmap. This is the question we posed:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text prompt" id="p35"> &#13;
   <p><strong class="prompt-head-image"><img alt="image" height="67px" src="../Images/Init-MA.png" width="66px"/></strong><strong><span class="aframe-location"/></strong>I look at a heatmap presenting sales revenue broken by the state where the sales had taken place and product categories sold. I can see that some states (e.g., SP) have much higher average sales than others - we’re talking about an order of magnitude difference. Some states have near-zero sales (e.g., RR, AP). I can also see differences between product categories. “Auto,” “Health and beauty,” and “Watches gifts” are much more popular than “Music” or “Fashion children’s clothes”. How should I interpret my results, and what actions could be taken to improve our business? </p> &#13;

   <p>The explanations provided by both of the generative AIs seem plausible, and the advice is worthy of a first-year marketing studies student. There is an important lesson to be learned here. Do you remember how we mentioned that your interpretation needs to be holistic, precise, and well-communicated? The reason behind the vagueness of these answers is a lack of detail in our prompt.</p> &#13;

   <p><span class="print-book-callout-head">Impossible is nothing</span>  The title of this callout is a blatant lie! The world of data analytics is full of limitations. In chapter 2, we explained how your analysis can only be as good as the data you have at your disposal. Generative AIs seem to be trained to respect such limitations and are reluctant to offer specific advice on the basis of vague data. </p> &#13;

   <p>As a test, we uploaded into ChatGPT the whole table we built figure 4.1 on, but we didn’t get any business insights in response.

Before expanding to these areas, research the local markets, considering factors like population, demographics, and purchasing power. To penetrate these markets, consider partnering with local retailers or leveraging e-commerce platforms. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p76"> Optimize distribution and logistics: Brazil’s large size and varying infrastructure can present challenges in product distribution. Focus on optimizing your supply chain and distribution network, especially in high-revenue states. Building strong relationships with local suppliers and distributors can help ensure timely and efficient delivery of products. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p77"> Leverage digital marketing and e-commerce: Use online marketing and e-commerce platforms to increase reach, especially in states where revenue is currently low. A strong digital presence can help you connect with more customers, gain insights into their preferences, and drive sales. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p78"> Analyze customer insights: Gather and analyze customer data and feedback to understand their preferences, needs, and regional trends better. Use this information to improve product offerings, marketing strategies, and customer experiences. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p79"> Monitor competition and trends: Keep an eye on industry trends and competitor activities in the Brazilian health and beauty market. Stay ahead of the curve by adapting your strategies and product offerings accordingly. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p80"> Invest in corporate social responsibility: Brazil’s diverse population cares about environmental and social issues. Investing in sustainable practices and supporting local communities can help improve your brand’s image and drive customer loyalty. </li> &#13;
  </ol> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p81"> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p102"> &#13;
   <p>The scatterplot we generated in chapter 3 when checking the performance of products in their categories and by region can be eye-glazing (figure 3.4). Let’s have a look at it again in figure 4.2.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;

   <p><strong class="response-head-image"><img alt="image" height="60px" src="../Images/Response.png" width="59px"/></strong><strong><span class="aframe-location"/></strong>A matrix of scatterplots showing pairwise relations between product prices, freight value, and order values can provide insights into the relationships between these variables and help you draw conclusions or identify trends. Here are some possible observations and conclusions:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ol class="response"> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p107"> Correlation between variables: Examine the direction and strength of the relationships between the variables. Positive correlations indicate that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well, while negative correlations indicate that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. Strong correlations might suggest that the variables influence each other or share a common underlying factor. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p108"> Outliers: Identify any outliers that may affect the relationships between the variables. Outliers can be a result of data errors, unique circumstances, or genuine extreme cases. Investigate these outliers to understand their impact on your analysis and conclusions. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p109"> Price sensitivity: Analyzing the relationship between product prices and order values can help you understand price sensitivity. If higher-priced products tend to have lower order values, it might indicate that customers are more price-sensitive and prefer more affordable products. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p110"> Freight value impact: The relationship between freight value and order value can reveal how shipping costs influence customer purchasing behavior. If order values tend to decrease as freight values increase, it might indicate that customers are sensitive to shipping costs and prefer to purchase from sellers that offer lower freight values. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p111"> Geographic factors: Comparing the scatterplot of freight value against product price or order value across different regions can highlight regional differences in shipping costs and customer preferences. It might be possible to identify areas where high freight values discourage customers from purchasing or where customers are more willing to pay higher shipping costs for specific products. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p112"> Product categories: Analyzing the scatterplot matrix for different product categories can reveal category-specific trends and preferences. Some categories might have a stronger correlation between product price and order value, while others might show a more pronounced relationship between freight value and order value. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p113"> Market segmentation: Based on the observed relationships between product prices, freight value, and order values, you can identify distinct market segments with different preferences and behaviors. This information can help you target your marketing efforts and tailor your product offerings to cater to these segments. </li> &#13;
  </ol> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p114"> &#13;
   <p>Remember that correlation does not imply causation. While the scatterplot matrix can help you identify patterns and relationships, it is essential to conduct further analysis and consider other factors before drawing definitive conclusions or making strategic decisions.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p115"> &#13;
   <p>That is how far the GPT support can take us with the interpretation. It is now on us to painstakingly analyze each of the presented elements, like geographic factors or product categories. For the sake of brevity, we won’t go down this rabbit hole. </p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p117"> &#13;
   <p>In chapter 3, we prepared a bar chart of counts of positive and negative reviews per product category. If you are asking yourself why you should even read a discussion about bar charts, you’re not alone. At the beginning of our data journey, we wondered why we should prepare one. They seem so trivial. However, this section may be one of the most important in the book. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text print-book-callout" id="p118"> &#13;
   <p><span class="print-book-callout-head">Clothes Don’t Maketh The Man</span>  The business value of any analysis does not lie in its complexity. Write this in large letters on your office wall, and keep it in your field of view, not behind your back. Even if a method seems rudimentary, the insights derived from it may be anything but trivial. These insights may form the foundation of a data-informed strategy, guiding improvements, marketing, and operational decisions that can significantly impact a business’s success and customer satisfaction. By starting with this easy to understand analytical method, businesses can immediately dive deeper into the data, uncovering more nuanced insights and driving meaningful changes based on direct customer feedback.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p119"> &#13;
   <p>While trying to make our analysis of the review scores more readable in chapter 3, we reduced the number of data points we visualized to a manageable number (originally shown in figure 3.8). The result is presented again in figure 4.3.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p120">  &#13;

   <h5 class="figure-container-h5 sigil_not_in_toc"><span class="num-string">Figure 4.3</span> Grouped bar plot showing aggregated review score counts by product categories aggregated into product groups</h5>&#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p121"> &#13;
   <p>At first glance, a grouped bar chart displaying counts of positive and negative reviews across different product categories may appear basic, but this simplicity belies its analytical power. By aggregating review scores into positive and negative categories and grouping them by product category, this chart distills complex consumer sentiment into an accessible, immediately understandable format. This clarity is not just about making data “easier” to digest; it provides a straightforward way to pinpoint areas of strength and weakness in a business’s product lineup at a glance.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p122"> &#13;
   <p>One critical insight this type of analysis offers is the direct identification of product categories that excel in customer satisfaction versus those that may be underperforming. This can serve as a preliminary diagnostic tool: a high ratio of positive to negative reviews in a category suggests a strong market fit and customer approval, while a lower ratio might indicate areas where product or service improvements are necessary.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p123"> &#13;
   <p>Moreover, this aggregated view allows businesses to benchmark performance across categories, fostering a competitive understanding internally and helping prioritize areas for strategic investment or product development. For instance, categories with high negative feedback might warrant further investigation into specific issues—be it product quality, customer expectations, or service delivery—providing actionable insights for targeted improvements.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p124"> &#13;
   <p>Beyond immediate product improvement strategies, analyzing review scores in this manner can also influence broader business decisions. Positive review trends can guide marketing strategies, highlighting strong points to emphasize in promotional materials or identifying popular products to feature in campaigns. Conversely, understanding the nuances of negative feedback can inform not just product refinement but also customer service protocols, return policies, and even supply chain adjustments.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p125"> &#13;
   <p>Expanding on the concept, this analytical approach isn’t limited to order reviews. Similar strategies can be applied to service evaluations, customer feedback on the shopping experience, and even employee satisfaction across different departments. Each application provides unique insights, from identifying best practices and areas of excellence to pinpointing challenges and opportunities for growth.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p126"> &#13;
   <p>There is a catch, though. Did you notice that we sneaked an element important for deriving conclusions into the preceding description—one that is not directly visible in the chart? To evaluate market fit, you need to look not at bar <em>heights</em> but at their <em>ratios</em>. You could, of course, use a ruler, a piece of paper, a pen, and a calculator (optional), but that’s a suboptimal approach. Fortunately, your generative AI advisor can provide you with digital stationery. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p127"> &#13;
   <p>In our experience, there is a useful lesson to learn here. Sometimes, you’ll follow your protocol and notice something interesting in one of the generated charts. If your deadline allows, you shouldn’t stick strictly to your protocol, and should instead take a look at the data from this new angle. The following example shows how you can quickly get the code needed to extract the data that interests you. </p> &#13;

The raw number of reviews (both positive and negative) is a result of the high number of purchases in the category, so the ratio is a much better approximation of the relative happiness of customers with these purchases.

  <div class="readable-text response" id="p150"> &#13;
   <p><strong class="response-head-image"><img alt="image" height="60px" src="../Images/Response.png" width="59px"/></strong><strong><span class="aframe-location"/></strong>While I don’t have up-to-date knowledge on the current status of Brazilian logistics and distribution (as my knowledge is up to September 2021), I can provide some general insights that might help you interpret your results.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ol class="response"> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p151"> Infrastructure: Brazil has a diverse transportation system consisting of roads, railways, waterways, and air transportation. However, the quality of infrastructure can vary significantly between regions, impacting delivery times. For example, the southeastern region, which includes São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, generally has better infrastructure compared to the northern and northeastern regions. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p152"> Geography: Brazil is a vast country with diverse landscapes, including large cities, remote rural areas, and the Amazon rainforest. The geography of the country can pose challenges for logistics and distribution, especially when transporting goods to remote areas or across the Amazon rainforest. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p153"> Road transportation: Road transportation is the most common mode of transportation for goods in Brazil. However, the quality of roads can be poor in some regions, leading to delays and increased transportation costs. Additionally, road transportation may be impacted by weather conditions, such as heavy rains causing flooding in certain regions. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p154"> Bureaucracy and customs: In some cases, bureaucracy and customs procedures can slow down the logistics process, especially for cross-border shipments or when dealing with specific regulatory requirements. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p155"> Regional disparities: Brazil has significant economic and social disparities between regions, which can impact the efficiency of the logistics and distribution system. More economically developed regions like São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and other southeastern states generally have better logistics infrastructure and services. </li> &#13;
  </ol> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p156"> &#13;
   <p>When analyzing the average delivery times for orders between different Brazilian states, consider the factors mentioned above. You might identify patterns and correlations between delivery times and specific regions, infrastructure quality, or geographical challenges. This information can help you identify areas where improvements can be made or where alternative distribution strategies may be needed.</p> &#13;

   <p>There you can see the difference between different generative AIs. ChatGPT tied the answer to specifics of Brazil’s diverse geography and variations in infrastructure quality, showing how economic development across regions can significantly impact sales revenues. We also learned that factors such as transport mode, road quality, weather conditions, bureaucracy, customs procedures, and regional economic disparities could lead to considerable differences in sales between states and product categories. Remember, though, that ChatGPT has a knowledge cutoff, so it would be prudent to confirm its revelations.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text response" id="p196"> &#13;
   <p><strong class="response-head-image"><img alt="image" height="60px" src="../Images/Response.png" width="59px"/></strong><strong><span class="aframe-location"/></strong>Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Espírito Santo (ES) are neighboring states in the southeastern region of Brazil. This region generally has better infrastructure, including roads and highways, compared to other parts of the country. As a result, you can expect relatively shorter delivery times for shipments between RJ and ES due to their proximity and the quality of the transportation infrastructure in the area.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p197"> &#13;
   <p>On the other hand, the northeastern state of Ceará (CE) and the southeastern state of Minas Gerais (MG) are farther apart. The distance between these states is significantly larger than the distance between RJ and ES, which can result in longer delivery times. Additionally, while MG is in the southeastern region with generally better infrastructure, CE is in the northeastern region, which may have less developed transportation infrastructure in some areas. This factor could also contribute to longer delivery times for shipments between CE and MG.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p198"> &#13;
   <p>In summary, you should generally expect shorter delivery times for shipments between Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Espírito Santo (ES) compared to Ceará (CE) and Minas Gerais (MG) due to their proximity and the transportation infrastructure in the southeastern region. However, it is important to note that there could be variations in delivery times depending on the specific locations within each state, the type of transportation used, and other factors such as weather conditions or bureaucratic processes.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p199"> &#13;
   <p>If an employee could deliver an answer as rapidly and comprehensively as ChatGPT, we’d not only grant them a raise but double it, tossing in a side of fries for good measure. ChatGPT noted that delivery times between Brazilian states largely depend on their geographical proximity and the quality of local transportation infrastructure. For instance, the delivery times between neighboring states of Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Espírito Santo (ES), both located in the better-connected southeastern region, are expected to be shorter. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p200"> &#13;
   <p>However, delivery between Ceará (CE) in the northeastern region and Minas Gerais (MG) in the southeast may take longer due to their geographical distance and potential disparities in infrastructure development. Furthermore, specific locations within each state, the type of transportation used, and other factors such as weather conditions or bureaucratic processes can also influence delivery times. It’s evident that even when the data in a chart is too vast to squeeze into a text prompt, and the chart itself is a real head-scratcher to describe, a well-trained generative AI can still prove immensely valuable in interpreting the results.</p> &#13;

   <h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_54"><span class="num-string">4.6</span> Relationship between product attributes and the shipping costs</h2> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p202"> &#13;
   <p>We never really expected an analysis of the relationship between product attributes and shipping costs to unravel any earth-shaking discoveries. In contrast, time spent on learning regression, one of the most powerful analytical tools, will be time well spent. In section 3.4.2, we presented you with a list of (not all) possible application areas for this methodology. But getting a result is one thing. Making sense of it . . . that’s where the value of analysis is. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p203"> &#13;
   <p>You might expect that only large R<sup>2</sup> values are worth reporting (recall that the R<sup>2</sup> value is a measure of what percent of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the changes in independent or tested variables). These are certainly the values most desired by business stakeholders. Who wouldn’t want to present a slide showing “85% of our sales are driven by our brilliant marketing”? I guess product development and customer support would turn green, but bragging rights are not the only business driver worth pursuing. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p204"> &#13;
   <p>Another example comes from our experiences. A company invested in a massive retention campaign. In fact, it was so aggressive that clients who were exposed to it were less likely to repurchase the product! This fact was hidden for a long time by the campaign, which used feedback surveys that benefited from the fact that really irritated clients didn’t want to waste their time on the company. A negative R<sup>2</sup> parameter value of regression testing the influence of the number of received messages on the likelihood of repurchase told a different story altogether. And this is not the end of the lesson. The company’s senior management didn’t want to admit to making a mistake and kept sending aggressive messages until the company went bankrupt.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p205"> &#13;
   <p>Does this mean you should focus on large positive or negative R<sup>2</sup> values? Yes and no. Such values are important, but this doesn’t mean that near-zero R<sup>2</sup> values aren’t. Let’s assume you entered your office one day and found yourself surrounded by life-sized models of dinosaurs. HR came up with the idea of “Dinosaur Desk Mates.” They decided that triggering employees’ “fight or flight” response to loud, unexpected roars would boost their productivity. After a couple of weeks, you’re tasked with analyzing the effectiveness of this idea. If your stakeholders are lucky, the R<sup>2 </sup>of the relation between the number of roars per hour and productivity metrics will oscillate around zero; otherwise, you’d probably be in the negative R<sup>2 </sup>range.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;

   <p>Let’s return to the relationship between product size and weight and shipping costs. In the realm of supply chain management, you may encounter situations where regression analysis can help you understand how product dimensions or weight impact shipping costs and can lead your company to redesign products for efficiency, potentially saving millions in logistics expenses. </p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text response" id="p213"> &#13;
   <p><strong class="response-head-image"><img alt="image" height="60px" src="../Images/Response.png" width="59px"/></strong><strong><span class="aframe-location"/></strong>Based on the results of the linear regression models, here are some practical conclusions and potential actions for your business:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ol class="response"> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p214"> Both product weight and volume are significant factors in determining shipping costs. The positive coefficients for both <code>product_weight_g</code> and <code>product_volume</code> indicate that as the weight and volume of the product increase, the shipping cost also increases. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p215"> The R-squared values for the individual models (0.37 for weight and 0.34 for volume) and the combined model (0.399) suggest that the models explain around 34-40% of the variance in the shipping costs. Although this is not a very strong relationship, it indicates that other factors also contribute to the shipping costs. It could be useful to explore additional factors that may impact shipping costs, such as the distance between the origin and destination, the shipping provider, or the shipping speed. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p216"> Given that both weight and volume have an impact on shipping costs, you can consider optimizing your packaging to minimize shipping costs. This could involve using lighter packaging materials or designing more compact packages to reduce the overall volume. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p217"> You could also consider offering different shipping options to customers based on the product’s weight and volume, allowing them to choose between more affordable, slower delivery options and faster, more expensive options. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p218"> When sourcing or developing new products, keep the shipping costs in mind. Consider the weight and volume of the product and how they may impact the overall cost for customers. Lighter and more compact products may be more attractive to customers due to lower shipping costs. </li> &#13;
  </ol> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p219"> &#13;
   <p>Remember that these conclusions are based on the provided models and their assumptions, and real-life situations may have additional factors to consider. Additionally, it’s essential to validate the models with further data and analysis to ensure their accuracy and reliability.</p> &#13;

  <ul class="response"> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text buletless-item" id="p223"> MAE, MSE, RMSE: These are error metrics: &#13;
    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha"> &#13;
     <li> MAE (Mean Absolute Error): The average absolute difference between the predicted shipping costs and actual costs. In both models, you’re off by about $6-7 on average. </li> &#13;
     <li> MSE (Mean Squared Error): Similar to MAE, but it squares the errors, emphasizing larger mistakes. </li> &#13;
     <li> RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): The square root of MSE, making it easier to interpret in the same units as your costs (dollars). </li> &#13;
    </ol></li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p224"> R2 (R-squared): An indicator of how much variation in shipping costs is explained by your model. In both cases, roughly 34-39% of the changes in costs are captured by the model. While not extraordinarily high, this is still useful. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p225"> &#13;
   <p>Key Takeaways</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ol class="response"> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p226"> Both Weight and Volume Matter: The combined model confirms that both product weight and volume are positively correlated with shipping costs. This means heavier and bulkier items cost more to ship. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p227"> Weight Might Be Slightly More Important: In the combined model, the coefficient for <code>product_weight_g</code> is slightly larger than that of <code>product_volume</code>. This suggests an additional gram of weight could increase the shipping cost a bit more than an additional cubic unit of volume. </li> &#13;

   <p>When you’re new to data analytics, ordinal logistic regression might seem an unnecessarily complex tool. The truth is, it’s necessarily a complex tool. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p241"> &#13;
   <p>Imagine you’re analyzing adherence to a prescribed medication regimen. This variable can be categorized into levels such as “never adheres,” “sometimes adheres,” “often adheres,” and “always adheres.” Your boss asks you to plan how you will test the influence of a new patient education program on medication adherence among chronic disease patients. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p242"> &#13;
   <p>Using ordinal logistic regression, you could investigate the program’s effectiveness by examining changes in adherence levels before and after the program’s implementation. Factors such as the thoroughness of the education, patient feedback on side effects, and frequency of follow-up consultations could be considered.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p243"> &#13;
   <p>The results could show, for example, that patients who rated the education program highly were 40% more likely to be in the “always adheres” category compared to those who did not participate in the program. Alternatively, it might reveal that patients experiencing moderate to severe side effects are twice as likely to fall into the “never adheres” or “sometimes adheres” categories, highlighting the need for targeted strategies to address these side effects.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p244"> &#13;
   <p>Analyzing data with ordinal logistic regression doesn’t stop at finding out what’s working or not. It may help you predict future trends and make informed decisions. If you are able to show that a particular aspect of your service, like personalized customer support, significantly boosts satisfaction, you’ll help your company enhance these areas and drive positive outcomes.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p245"> &#13;
   <p>In section 3.4.3, we mentioned that the coefficients of ordinal logistic regressions are somewhat similar to their counterparts resulting from linear regression. We also warned you that, in the case of ordinal logistic regressions, coefficients should be interpreted with particular caution, especially if, like in the case of the data we analyzed, the model’s goodness-of-fit statistics (e.g., R<sup>2</sup>, AIC) indicate that the model may not adequately capture the relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable. </p> &#13;

   <p><strong class="response-head-image"><img alt="image" height="60px" src="../Images/Response.png" width="59px"/></strong><strong><span class="aframe-location"/></strong>Your results from the ordinal logistic regression analysis illuminate several important factors influencing review scores in your eCommerce platform. Let’s dissect these findings, considering both the statistical significances (implied by the coefficients) and their practical implications for the business. The accuracy of the model stands at 43.03%, which, while not exceptionally high, does suggest that the variables considered do explain some of the variance in review scores.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ol class="response"> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text buletless-item" id="p253"> Coefficients Interpretation: &#13;
    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha"> &#13;
     <li> Delivery time (-0.04926): As expected, longer delivery times negatively impact review scores. This indicates that improving delivery speed can directly enhance customer satisfaction. </li> &#13;
     <li> Price (0.00164) and Freight value (0.00309): These have positive coefficients, but given their small magnitude, the impact on review scores might be less substantial. Price sensitivity could vary significantly across different product categories. </li> &#13;
     <li> Product name length (0.01389): Longer product names, perhaps implying more detailed descriptions, slightly improve review scores. This might indicate that customers appreciate clearer information. </li> &#13;
     <li> Product description length (very small positive impact): While statistically significant, its practical impact might be negligible due to the small coefficient. </li> &#13;
     <li> Product photos qty (0.42137): A significant positive impact, suggesting that listings with more photos lead to higher satisfaction. Visual information appears crucial for customer decisions. </li> &#13;
     <li> Product weight (negligible negative impact): The slight negative coefficient might be related to shipping costs or handling expectations but is likely not a major concern given its magnitude. </li> &#13;

      <ol style="list-style: lower-roman"> &#13;
       <li> Sequential (0.35979) and Installments (0.02936): Positive coefficients suggest that flexibility in payment options positively affects customer satisfaction. </li> &#13;
       <li> Payment value (negative): Higher overall payment amounts slightly decrease satisfaction, possibly reflecting higher expectations or buyer’s remorse at higher price points. </li> &#13;
       <li> Payment types: Credit card payments show the most substantial positive effect, indicating a preference or higher satisfaction among those users, while vouchers slightly decrease satisfaction. </li> &#13;
      </ol></li> &#13;
     <li> Delivery time misestimation (0.02821): When delivery estimates are inaccurate (whether early or late is not specified), it slightly increases review scores, suggesting that customers might appreciate conservatism in delivery estimates or be pleasantly surprised by early deliveries. </li> &#13;
     <li> Product volume (negligible positive impact): Its effect is minimal, suggesting that the size of the product is not a significant determinant of review scores. </li> &#13;
    </ol></li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text buletless-item" id="p254"> Model’s Predictive Performance (Accuracy &amp; Confusion Matrix): &#13;
    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha"> &#13;
     <li> The accuracy, while not negligible, indicates a lot of room for improvement. This suggests either inherent unpredictability in review scores or the need for additional or different explanatory variables. </li> &#13;
     <li> The confusion matrix shows a significant challenge in accurately predicting extreme review scores (1 and 5), with a tendency to predict towards the middle range. This might indicate either a model issue (such as assuming linearity in ordinal outcomes) or that customer satisfaction is influenced by factors not captured in the model. </li> &#13;

   <p>Understanding Ordinal Logistic Regression</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p265"> &#13;
   <p>Ordinal logistic regression is appropriate when your outcome variable is ordered, like review scores (e.g., 1-star, 2-star, etc.). Here’s how to interpret the key elements:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul class="response"> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text buletless-item" id="p266"> Coefficients: &#13;
    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha"> &#13;
     <li> Positive Coefficient: Indicates that an increase in that variable is associated with a higher likelihood of a better review score. </li> &#13;
     <li> Negative Coefficient: Indicates an increase in that variable is associated with a higher likelihood of a worse review score. </li> &#13;
     <li> Magnitude of Coefficient: The larger the absolute value of the coefficient, the stronger the association with the review score. </li> &#13;
    </ol></li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p267"> Accuracy: This tells you the percentage of reviews your model correctly classified into their score categories. An accuracy of 43% suggests your model does better than simply guessing but leaves significant room for improvement. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p268"> Confusion Matrix: This shows how your model’s predictions compared to actual review scores. Read it diagonally for correct predictions, and other cells show misclassifications. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p269"> &#13;
   <p>Key Takeaways</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ol class="response"> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p270"> Delivery &amp; Price Matter Most: <code>delivery_time</code> and price have the largest negative and positive coefficients, respectively. This strongly suggests: &#13;
    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha"> &#13;
     <li> Late deliveries are detrimental to review scores. </li> &#13;
     <li> Higher-priced items might lead to higher expectations, increasing the likelihood of both higher and lower scores. </li> &#13;
    </ol></li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text buletless-item" id="p271"> Other Significant Factors: &#13;
    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha"> &#13;
     <li> <code>product_photos_qty</code>: More product photos seem to help improve review scores. </li> &#13;
     <li> <code>payment_type</code>: Interestingly, payment type influences scores, with credit cards being the most favorable. </li> &#13;
     <li> <code>payment_sequential</code>: This likely indicates whether a customer was a first-time or repeat buyer, with the latter potentially being more lenient. </li> &#13;
    </ol></li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text buletless-item" id="p272"> Negligible or Confusing Factors: &#13;
    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha"> &#13;
     <li> Several variables have very small coefficients, suggesting minimal impact (<code>product_weight_g</code>, <code>product_volume</code>, <code>freight_value</code>). </li> &#13;
     <li> <code>delivery_time_misestimation</code> has a small but positive coefficient. This is counterintuitive and might need further investigation into how you calculate this variable. </li> &#13;
    </ol></li> &#13;
  </ol> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p273"> &#13;
   <p>Practical Applications</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul class="response"> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p274"> Prioritize On-Time Delivery: Focus heavily on timely delivery, as this has the most significant impact on customer satisfaction. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p275"> Competitive Pricing Strategy: Balance the desire for higher prices with the need to manage customer expectations and avoid negative reviews. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p276"> Invest in Product Photography: Add more high-quality product photos to give customers a clear picture of what they’re buying. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p277"> Understand Payment Preferences: Explore why payment methods impact reviews. Perhaps credit card purchases are associated with higher-value orders? </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p278"> Target Repeat Customers: Since they seem more likely to give better reviews, implement strategies to build customer loyalty. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text response" id="p279"> &#13;
   <p>Important Considerations</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul class="response"> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p280"> Accuracy Limitations: The model’s accuracy leaves room for other important factors not included. Consider collecting data on additional variables (product quality, customer service, etc.). </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p281"> Causation vs. Correlation: This analysis points towards associations, but it doesn’t prove that changing any specific factor will directly cause a change in review scores. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;

   <p>Both generative AIs provided us with a lot of food for thought on the basis of a couple of parameters, their coefficients, and a single-sentence business description. Before being transformed into airtight business recommendations, most of these results would need deep-dive analytics, but we got some solid leads, and that’s more than we bargained for!</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p285"> &#13;
   <p>In chapter 3, we used the bootstrap method to calculate the confidence intervals for the average price of health and beauty products and for the customer satisfaction across Brazilian states. The resulting figure 3.12 is repeated as figure 4.6.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p286">  &#13;

   <h5 class="figure-container-h5 sigil_not_in_toc"><span class="num-string">Figure 4.6</span> Confidence intervals for (a) average sales price and (b) average review scores, for transactions in the “health and beauty” category of products<span class="aframe-location"/></h5>&#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p287"> &#13;
   <p>The first important part of analyzing this result is to understand that the actual average value is somewhere within the confidence interval. Somewhere—we don’t know where. The width of the confidence intervals depend on three main factors: </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p288"> The size of the sample </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p289"> The selected confidence level </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p290"> Inherent data variability </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p291"> &#13;
   <p>Many managers are used to seeing point estimations, and they want to be able to say that the average satisfaction of our customers is, for example, 3.7495735 points out of 5. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p292"> &#13;
   <p>This is where we solve the riddle we posed in subsection 3.4.4. We asked you there, “why, when working with our example, does it make sense to use bootstrapping and calculate confidence intervals for our prices, and why would it most likely not make sense if you worked with your business data?” We calculated the average price confidence intervals, because we know from the exploratory data analysis that we are working with a subset of the data. In our table, we don’t have all the transactions for the analyzed period. If you work with complete data, your average sales price <em>can be</em> USD 3.7495735 (the purposefulness of reporting it with this level of accuracy is a different issue altogether). You don’t <em>estimate </em>the average of a complete population—you <em>calculate </em>it. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p293"> &#13;
   <p>Working with surveys requires <em>estimation</em>, and estimations come with inherent limitations in <em>accuracy </em>and are subject to <em>uncertainty</em>. It’s crucial to account for this uncertainty in the decision-making process. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p294"> &#13;
   <p>Have a look at figure 4.6.b, which shows the confidence interval between the SP and PE states. Customers in which state are more satisfied? We don’t know, mainly because we don’t really know how satisfied PE customers are.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p295"> &#13;
   <p>In the figure, we have some conclusion-ready confidence intervals. ES customer satisfaction requires immediate attention, and that would be obvious even if you just calculated average scores. The average price of products in CE is much higher than anywhere else in the country. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p296"> &#13;
   <p>There is more to analyzing confidence intervals. The most obvious interpretation is that if the confidence intervals calculated for two categories (e.g., states) are not overlapping, the actual calculated values indeed differ. There are analytical methods for estimating the difference of the overlapping confidence intervals, but we won’t follow this rabbit hole here. In many business contexts, the width of the confidence intervals, which indicates the estimate’s precision, can be just as crucial as the difference between the estimated values themselves. A narrower confidence interval implies greater precision and reliability in the estimate, which is important from an informed decision-making perspective. </p> &#13;

   <p>The process also revealed the weaknesses of generative AIs. The most notable is their tendency to hallucinate when asked about topics and data defined too long before the prompt. Also, the provided code needs to be tested, as sometimes it’s buggy and sometimes prepared for outdated library versions.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p299"> &#13;
   <p>All in all, we determined which topics are important to research with just a couple of discussions with generative AI about the goals of your analysis and what it could look like, running some code it developed for you, and then another couple of discussions on results. When you get fluent and choose the generative AI best fitted to help in your problems, you’ll be able to do it in a couple of hours instead of days!</p> &#13;
