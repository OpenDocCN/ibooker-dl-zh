    low-power devices. This is a new and rapidly growing field, so what we’ve included
    here is just a snapshot. If you want to stay up to date, here are some resources
    we recommend.

- en: The [TinyML Summit](https://www.tinymlsummit.org) is an annual conference that
    brings together embedded hardware, software, and machine learning practitioners
    to discuss collaborations across these disciplines. There are also monthly meetups
    in the [Bay Area](https://oreil.ly/ZtZu_) and [Austin, TX](https://oreil.ly/cH9d-),
    with more locations expected in the future. You can check the [TinyML Foundation
    website](https://www.tinymlsummit.org) for videos, slides, and other materials
    from the events, even if you can’t make it in person.

- en: This book focuses on TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers, and if you’re interested
    in contributing to the framework there’s a Special Interest Group (SIG) that enables
    external developers to collaborate on improvements. [SIG Micro](https://oreil.ly/owmCE)
    has [public monthly video meetings](https://oreil.ly/1AdpF), a [mailing list](https://oreil.ly/qFhbv),
    and a [Gitter chat room](https://oreil.ly/btt1p). If you have an idea or a request
    for a new feature in the library, this is a good place to discuss it. You’ll see
    all the developers working on the project, both inside and outside Google, sharing
    roadmaps and plans for upcoming work. The usual process for any changes is to
    start by sharing a design document, which can be just a single page for simple
    changes, covering why the change is needed and what it will do. We usually publish
    this as an RFC (“request for comment”) to allow stakeholders to contribute their
    feedback, and then follow it up with a pull request containing the actual code
    changes once the approach is agreed.

    and you can check there for the latest examples and documentation. In particular,
    we’ll be continuing our migration to TensorFlow 2.0 in our training sample code,
    so it’s worth taking a look if you’re having compatibility problems.

- en: We’ve focused on the TensorFlow ecosystem given that this is the library we
    know best, but there’s a lot of interesting work happening on other frameworks,
    too. We’re big fans of Neil Tan’s pioneering work on [uTensor](https://oreil.ly/IfTva),
    which has a lot of interesting experiments with code generation from TensorFlow
    models. Microsoft’s [Embedded Learning Library](https://oreil.ly/Q-r3d) supports
    a large variety of different machine learning algorithms beyond deep neural networks,
    and is aimed at Arduino and micro:bit platforms.

    the world about? We’d love to see what problems you’re solving, and one great
    way of reaching us is by sharing a link on Twitter using the *#tinyml* hashtag.
    We’re both on Twitter ourselves as [@petewarden](https://oreil.ly/S60rg) and [@dansitu](https://oreil.ly/xswxw),
    and we’ll be posting updates on this book at [@tinymlbook](https://oreil.ly/4NaMB).
