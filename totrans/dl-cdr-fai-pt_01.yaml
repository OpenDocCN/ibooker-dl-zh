- en: In a very short time, deep learning has become a widely useful technique, solving
    and automating problems in computer vision, robotics, healthcare, physics, biology,
    and beyond. One of the delightful things about deep learning is its relative simplicity.
    Powerful deep learning software has been built to make getting started fast and
    easy. In a few weeks, you can understand the basics and get comfortable with the
    techniques.

- en: This opens up a world of creativity. You start applying it to problems that
    have data at hand, and you feel wonderful seeing a machine solving problems for
    you. However, you slowly feel yourself getting closer to a giant barrier. You
    built a deep learning model, but it doesn’t work as well as you had hoped. This
    is when you enter the next stage, finding and reading state-of-the-art research
    on deep learning.

- en: However, there’s a voluminous body of knowledge on deep learning, with three
    decades of theory, techniques, and tooling behind it. As you read through some
    of this research, you realize that humans can explain simple things in really
    complicated ways. Scientists use words and mathematical notation in these papers
    that appear foreign, and no textbook or blog post seems to cover the necessary
    background that you need in accessible ways. Engineers and programmers assume
    you know how GPUs work and have knowledge about obscure tools.

    who was in your shoes before, who knows the tooling and the math—someone who could
    guide you through the best research, state-of-the-art techniques, and advanced
    engineering, and make it comically simple. I was in your shoes a decade ago, when
    I was breaking into the field of machine learning. For years, I struggled to understand
    papers that had a little bit of math in them. I had good mentors around me, which
    helped me greatly, but it took me many years to get comfortable with machine learning
    and deep learning. That motivated me to coauthor PyTorch, a software framework
    to make deep learning accessible.

    and apply deep learning, without any previous formal training as ML scientists
    or engineers. Like me, Jeremy and Sylvain learned gradually over the years and
    eventually became experts and leaders. But unlike me, Jeremy and Sylvain selflessly
    put a huge amount of energy into making sure others don’t have to take the painful
    path that they took. They built a great course called fast.ai that makes cutting-edge
    deep learning techniques accessible to people who know basic programming. It has
    graduated hundreds of thousands of eager learners who have become great practitioners.

- en: In this book, which is another tireless product, Jeremy and Sylvain have constructed
    a magical journey through deep learning. They use simple words and introduce every
    concept. They bring cutting-edge deep learning and state-of-the-art research to
    you, yet make it very accessible.

    language processing, and learn some foundational math in a 500-page delightful
    ride. And the ride doesn’t stop at fun, as they take you through shipping your
    ideas to production. You can treat the fast.ai community, thousands of practitioners
    online, as your extended family, where individuals like you are available to talk
    and ideate small and big solutions, whatever the problem may be.

    learning to good use, regardless of the nature of the problem.
