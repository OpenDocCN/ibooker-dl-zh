<p class="body"><span class="fm-part-initial-cap">T</span>his part covers some applications of the generative models from earlier chapters as well as some new developments in the field of generative AI.</p>
<p class="body">In chapters 13 and 14, you’ll learn two ways of generating music: MuseGAN, which treats a piece of music as a multidimensional object akin to an image, and Music Transformer, which treats a piece of music as a sequence of musical events. Chapter 15 introduces you to diffusion models, which form the foundation of all leading text-to-image Transformers (such as DALL-E 2 or Imagen). Chapter 16 uses the LangChain library to combine pretrained large language models with Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia APIs to create a zero-shot know-it-all personal assistant.</p>
