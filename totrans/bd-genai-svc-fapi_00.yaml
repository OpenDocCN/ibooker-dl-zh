- en: I remember the day Ali, our head of engineering at ADSP, walked confidently
    into the office and declared he wanted to write a book on building generative
    AI services. Knowing the mammoth-sized undertaking that is writing a technical
    book, I offered him a strong cup of coffee and regaled him with a few tales of
    my own late-night writing sessions, fueled by caffeine and the sheer will to meet
    a deadline. I might have even thrown in a cautionary whisper about the ever-present
    temptation to rewrite entire chapters at 3 a.m. But Ali was steadfast. He had
    that glint in his eye—a mix of determination and a clear vision. He knew he wanted
    to create something special, something that would demystify the complexities of
    generative AI and empower others to build.

- en: Having now read *Building Generative AI Applications with FastAPI*, I can say
    he’s done far more than that. Ali has crafted a truly indispensable guide for
    anyone looking to move beyond theoretical discussions about AI and into the realm
    of practical, real-world application. And somehow, he’s made the whole process
    look deceptively easy.

- en: As co-founder of an AI consultancy, I’ve seen firsthand the growing need for
    engineers who not only can understand how AI works but also build production-grade
    solutions with AI. We are in a period of profound transformation, where AI is
    rapidly changing how we live and work. It’s no longer enough to be a passive consumer
    of AI-powered products. The future belongs to those who can harness the power
    of generative models to create, innovate, and solve real problems. This book is
    the perfect starting point for that journey.

    concepts with clear, concise explanations and practical examples. The code snippets
    aren’t just toy examples; they are building blocks for real applications. He guides
    you through the intricacies of FastAPI, authentication, authorization, and database
    integration with the confidence of a seasoned engineer who has spent countless
    hours wrestling with these challenges in the real world.
