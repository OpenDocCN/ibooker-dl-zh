    on massive datasets from the internet that are likely to contain personal information,
    bias, and other types of undesirable content. While some LLM developers use the
    unrestricted nature of their models as a selling point, most major LLM providers
    have a set of policies around the kinds of content they *don’t* want the model
    to produce and are dedicating a great deal of effort to ensuring that their models
    follow those policies as closely as possible. For example, commercial LLM providers
    often don’t want LLMs to generate hate speech or discrimination because it could
    reflect poorly on the company in the eyes of consumers. Although these specific
    policies will vary depending on organizational values and external pressures,
    ultimately, improving the safety of an LLM is about exercising control over the
    model’s generations, and that requires technical interventions.

    could affect model and data governance in the long term. As we’ll discuss, regulatory

    on a variety of benchmark datasets. However, any system that is available for
    public use, whether through a web interface or an application programming interface
    (API), *will* undergo adversarial testing. Even though most companies release
    LLMs with a set of guidelines for their use, the first thing that many users will
    do is attempt to produce a response from the model that violates content policy,
    sometimes called an “unsafe” response. Some people might unintentionally run into
    content policy violations by discussing sensitive topics; others will try this
    quite willfully, through a variety of *prompt hacking* strategies. Prompt hacking
    refers to submitting user input to the model that is designed to change the model’s
    behavior. We’ll discuss prompting strategies and prompt hacking in more detail
    later in this book, but for now, let’s look at an example.

    However, this is also an undesirable output: the model has generated text that
    reinforces longstanding sexist tropes. A challenge that LLM developers have is
    preventing things like this from happening, which they might want to do because
    of their own moral stances, risk to their company or product’s reputation, and
    potentially legal or regulatory risk, depending on the subject of the model’s
    response. All of these risks lead companies to write policies and create safeguards
    around such areas as racist and extremist content, legal and medical advice, and
    instructions for illegal or harmful actions, among other categories.'

    the problem of AI safety, a wide field of study that focuses on preventing machine
    learning models from doing things their creators don’t want them to. A related
    term used in industry is *AI alignment*, where “alignment” refers to alignment
    between the goals of a given machine learning system and the intended goals of
    its human creators, or—more broadly—the alignment between powerful AI systems
    and human values. Much of this work has a theoretical bent for the time being—regarding
    superintelligent agents interacting with the world—although certainly there is
    ongoing technical work to improve how the current generation of models respond
    to particular types of queries. Here, we focus concretely on the case of LLMs

    that people are using to try to prevent the model from generating responses that
    it shouldn’t. The first and simplest to implement is to post-process the model’s
    output with some kind of toxicity classifier to detect when the output is “toxic”
    and resort to a default nonresponse. For example, you could easily imagine the
    model in the preceding example saying something like, “I’m sorry, it is against
    my guidelines to engage with such stereotypes.” In fact, this particular prompt
    no longer leads to the same unsafe generation as it once did; when we tried it
    again, ChatGPT replied:'

    in the scientific field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While we can’t say exactly how OpenAI is making such adjustments to better align
    its model with its corporate values, one possible step would be to detect that
    the original response contained a hateful ideology with the classifier, and then
    regenerate a new response that the classifier predicted was acceptable. This classifier
    would typically be a smaller language model that is tuned for classification on
    labeled training data, which demonstrates responses that are and aren’t against
    company policy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Assuming the classifier was able to learn to differentiate between violative
    and nonviolative responses, this might be a very safe approach: especially if
    the developers of the LLM were willing to tolerate false positives (which would
    result in the model dodging questions that it could have safely answered), they
    would be able to drive the rate of violative responses almost arbitrarily low.
    The main problem with this approach is that it’s irritating from a user perspective
    to get a message like, “I’m sorry, it is against my guidelines to discuss this,”
    especially if the topic posed by the user wasn’t a toxic one. When one is more
    heavy-handed in stopping certain model generations, the response is less likely
    to be the one that the user is looking for. Anthropic AI (see [www.anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com/)),
    a leading LLM startup and AI safety laboratory, describes this tension as “helpful”
    against “harmless” (and, in papers, suggest that three primary characteristics
    that must be balanced in LLM development are helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty)
    [[2]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00861). The model from the first example is responding
    in an arguably more “helpful” manner because it complies with the user’s request,
    but responds in a way that produces harm. LLM developers must try to balance the
    objectives of creating a helpful chatbot with safety guardrails to prevent harm.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another idea in this vein is to condition on or filter out the training data
    of the original LLM according to its level of harmfulness. Conceptually, if we
    were successful in doing this, the model wouldn’t generate obscene content—for
    example—because it has never seen the relevant text in the first place, and thus
    doesn’t “know” profanities it might use. This helps with not generating toxic
    text, but as you might imagine, it tends to make the model slightly worse at detecting
    toxic text.
  prefs: []

- en: We have enough experience with human nature to be sure that any LLM launched
    to the public will certainly be the recipient of plenty of harmful, hateful, and
    adversarial user inputs. People will ask the model for and send explicit sexual
    content, misogynist jokes and ethnic slurs, graphic depictions of violence, and
    so on. Any strategy for model governance must acknowledge this reality, and, ideally,
    we would like to gracefully handle responses to prompts like these in a way that
    is on topic but stands against racism, misogyny, or whatever objectionable material
    is present. Still, some experiments have shown empirically that careful conditional
    pre-training can substantially reduce the toxic generations from the model while
    maintaining most of its natural language understanding ability [[3]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07790).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although the specific workflows may vary, this approach generally also involves
    a classifier trained to detect toxic or unsafe content. Instead of classifying
    model outputs, the classifier instead runs through the unlabeled pre-training
    data, which again is typically made up of many disparate sources. If we were using
    Reddit as one such source, we might identify some subreddits that contained lots
    of toxic speech and excise those subreddits from the model’s training to steer
    the model’s distribution of possible generations away from that type of speech
    (filtering). Or, we might include the subreddits in the pre-training dataset,
    but label them from the outset as unsafe and the other texts as safe; then, at
    inference time, tell the model that we want the generations to resemble the safe
    texts rather than the unsafe ones (conditional pre-training). The success of both
    of these techniques relies on being able to classify the toxicity or potential
    riskiness of vast amounts of data, but even when this is done imperfectly, conditional
    pre-training especially can have highly desirable effects on the LLM produced
    [[4]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08582), even before any fine-tuning or post-processing.

- en: Additionally, relatively newer and more complex machine learning training strategies
    have been used in the current generation of LLMs. Recall from chapter 1 that supervised
    learning and reinforcement learning represent different learning paradigms. In
    supervised learning, the underlying assumption is that there is a line in the
    sand where one side represents what the model can say, and the other side represents
    what the model shouldn’t. This “line”—which is very unlikely to be linear or ever
    possible to be defined exactly—is called the decision boundary. Supervised learning
    techniques are oriented around estimating the decision boundary for a particular
    task. Figure 3.1 depicts a hypothetical classification task with three classes.
    The dotted lines represent the decision boundaries that the model has learned
    for this task based on the examples in its training data, represented by the points.

    and was previously mostly used for tasks with an easily defined reward function.
    However, distinguishing good and bad model outputs, especially considering the
    vast array of possible violations—from publishing private information to inventing
    harmful misinformation—doesn’t have such a function. Even more problematic is
    that it’s not easy to define the model’s desired outputs in all cases, so the
    model can’t simply imitate particular responses.

    learning to try to “train out” unsafe behavior and using human feedback to define
    the reward function iteratively [[5]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741). In practice,
    this means getting humans to evaluate the model’s responses by either labeling
    those responses as acceptable or problematic or by specifying their preferred
    response. Although humans will still differ in their assessments of the model’s
    responses, the human preference data in aggregate will eventually approximate
    the model’s ideal behavior. With that data, the reward function for the model
    is estimated, and the model’s responses improve over time, where improvement is
    defined as writing better and less problematic responses as judged by the human
    evaluators. This strategy, known as reinforcement learning from human feedback
    (RLHF) and illustrated in figure 3.2, proved much more scalable and adaptive than
    previous methods, and was quickly adopted by LLM developers across the industry.'

    labels have long been standard industry practice for building machine learning
    systems, including for content moderation. This work requires repeated exposure
    to content that can be traumatic and is usually outsourced to contractors or gig
    workers who don’t have the resources or workplace protections of a salaried tech
    employee. For ChatGPT, a *TIME* investigation found that OpenAI used outsourced
    Kenyan laborers earning $1 to $2 per hour to label examples of hate speech, sexual
    abuse, and violence, among others. These labeled examples contributed to building
    a tool to detect “toxic” content, which was eventually built into ChatGPT. In
    addition to being underpaid, the Kenyan workers say that they were “mentally scarred”
    from the content that they had to go through [[6]](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/).

- en: Because of the costs of human feedback, as well as the speed and scale that
    AI enables, the newest techniques for LLM safety are centered on removing humans
    from the loop where possible. Instead of reinforcement learning from human feedback,
    these methods are logically called reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF).
    Anthropic introduced an RLAIF method called “Constitutional AI” [[7]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073),
    which involves the creation of a list of principles (which they call a constitution)
    that any model should follow. At Anthropic, these principles are drawn from such
    disparate sources, for example, as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (“Please
    choose the response that most supports and encourages freedom, equality, and a
    sense of brotherhood”) and Apple’s Terms of Service (“Please choose the response
    that has the least personal, private, or confidential information belonging to
    others”) [[8]](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claudes-constitution). Then, they
    fine-tune one model to apply these principles to various scenarios with example
    model outputs. After that, they let this model, designed to apply the rules to
    real conversations, critique outputs from the generator model, which is a standard
    LLM trying to respond to some input prompt. The first model can identify responses
    that violate the “constitution” and then instruct the second model accordingly
    based on its feedback.

- en: 'The Constitutional AI approach (shown in figure 3.3) and RLAIF methods like
    it are perhaps the most promising approaches technically. In the immediate future,
    some combination of human and AI feedback is likely what will lead to the best-trained
    models. However, as LLMs become increasingly powerful, it’s reasonable to expect
    that more and more pieces of the training pipeline that involve humans currently
    may be automated. In a few months, there may be other setups that work even better.
    In a few years, there almost certainly will be, which is part of what makes this
    such an exciting area. For safety especially, this is good news: content moderation
    is famously emotionally taxing work, and as we’re able to reduce the reliance
    on manual review, it means that fewer and fewer people will ever have to see the
    worst and most despicable ideas, threats, and violent ideologies.'

    data collection. We want to ensure that our model would not generate suicide-related
    or self-harm content—anything that could encourage or instruct a person in crisis
    to go ahead with harming themselves. This is a sadly relevant topic. In early
    2023, a Belgian man struggling with depression was chatting with a chatbot when
    the bot allegedly encouraged the man to take his own life, and, tragically, he

    topics.

- en: In the second case, we would at least need to label lots of text examples based
    on whether or not particular content provided instructions or encouragement for
    self-harm. In RLHF, again, we need humans to provide human feedback. With Constitutional
    AI and other techniques that use RLAIF, we might describe our desired policy around
    such content, and then let a language model learn to identify violations with
    zero-shot or few-shot learning. We could let that model critique outputs generated
    by another model, and we could even collect additional conversations related to
    self-harm between multiple language models, with no harm to humans. Then, the
    model trained to identify violations could label those conversations, and we could
    feed the data to our generator model through fine-tuning.

    store data of or concerned with real persons. In the 1970s and 1980s, the first
    data protection laws were introduced in response to government-operated databases.
    In 1973, Sweden became the first country to enact a national data protection law
    [[20]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2982482). Early data protection laws were
    limited in scope and largely focused on holding database owners and operators
    accountable for the security and accuracy of data. They were also primarily adopted
    for databases and official records maintained by government entities. Soon after,
    Germany, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and several countries
    in Latin America followed by passing their own data protection laws.'

    the early 1970s. Based on the federal code of Fair Information Practices (FIPs)
    outlined by the Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems within the
    Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) [[21]](https://www.justice.gov/opcl/docs/rec-com-rights.pdf),
    the US Congress passed the Privacy Act of 1974 to govern the collection and use
    of personal information by federal agencies (see [http://mng.bz/9Q7o](http://mng.bz/9Q7o)).
    As shown in figure 3.4, the FIPs consisted of the following five principles: collection
    limitation, disclosure, secondary usage, record correction, and security. These
    standards became the foundation of privacy policies, inspiring multiple national
    principles and legal frameworks in the coming decades. FIPs and the subsequent
    FIP-inspired frameworks in conjunction formed the Fair Information Practice Principles
    (FIPPs) (see [http://mng.bz/j1op](http://mng.bz/j1op)).'

    the first internationally agreed-upon set of data protection principles, which
    largely followed the core FIPPs and added a new principle, accountability (see
    [http://oecdprivacy.org/](http://oecdprivacy.org/)). Again, inspired by the FIPPs
    as established in the OECD principles, the first modern data protection law of
    the digital era was introduced as the Data Protection Directive (DPD) by the European
    Parliament in 1995\. In 2012, the European Commission formally proposed the General
    Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a necessary update to DPD, which was approved
    by the European Parliament in 2016, and became national law in 2018 [[22]](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-eu_en).

    (FTC) narrowed OECD’s eight principles to focus on notion and choice. The idea
    behind centering on the principles of notion and choice was that individuals could
    make informed decisions about data collection and use given adequate information
    about the purpose of data collection [[23]](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1156972).
    It wasn’t until 2018 that the California legislature passed the California Consumer
    Privacy Act (CCPA)—the first state-level privacy law in the United States [[24]](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa).

    87 million users for political advertising [[25]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.xhtml),
    CCPA is concerned with data security and reactive risk mitigation. In 2023, the
    California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act (CPRA) replaced the CCPA by expanding
    on existing rights and introducing new ones [[26]](https://www.weil.com/-/media/the-california-privacy-rights-act-of-2020-may-2021.pdf).
    The CCPA was followed by comprehensive legislation in Colorado, Connecticut, Iowa,
    Virginia, and Utah, as well as proposals in several other states [[27]](https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/).
    Similarly, the US Congress started introducing federal data privacy proposals,
    as well as adopted federal bills to address narrower problems regarding children’s
    online privacy, facial recognition technology, and more. For a timeline summarizing
    major data protection laws, see figure 3.5.

    individuals *even* if their personal information is publicly available online.
    According to Italy’s data regulator (Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali),
    ChatGPT has four problems under GDPR that led to the temporary ban of the tool
    in March 2023\. First, there are no age controls to prevent children under the
    age of 13 from using the tool. Second, ChatGPT can provide inaccurate information
    about people. Third, OpenAI hasn’t told people that their data is being collected.
    Fourth and finally, there is “no legal basis” for collecting people’s personal
    information to train ChatGPT [[31]](https://www.wired.com/story/italy-ban-chatgpt-privacy-gdpr/).
    Italy gave OpenAI a month to comply with GDPR, which would mean that OpenAI would
    have to either ask people to have their data collected or prove that the company
    has a “legitimate interest” in collecting people’s personal data for developing
    their models as outlined in their flimsy privacy policy. If unable to prove that
    their data practices are legal, ChatGPT could be banned in specific European countries
    or the entire European Union. OpenAI additionally could face substantial fines,
    and be forced to delete models or the data used to train them [[32]](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/19/1071789/openais-hunger-for-data-is-coming-back-to-bite-it/).
    To comply with the EU’s data privacy rules, OpenAI added information on its website
    about how it collects and uses data, provided EU users the option to opt out of
    having their data used for training, and added a tool to verify a user’s age during
    signup. The chatbot was made available in Italy again, but Garante has urged the
    company to meet other data rights standards as well, and the parties remain in
    ongoing negotiation around what full compliance for the service requires [[33]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/04/28/chatgpt-openai-data-privacy-italy/9f77378a-e5e8-11ed-9696-8e874fd710b8_story.xhtml).

    In addition to investigations from several European countries, the European Data
    Protection Board (EDPB) also launched a dedicated task force on possible enforcement
    actions against OpenAI for ChatGPT in April 2023 [[35]](https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/edpb-resolves-dispute-transfers-meta-and-creates-task-force-chat-gpt_en).

    of undocumented and unlabeled data, which means it would be an exceedingly difficult
    task for OpenAI to find all data from Italian users, or any specific individuals,
    in their training dataset to delete it. Here, the sources of data may be unclear,
    and they likely don’t know what exactly is in their dataset. While GDPR gives
    people the ability to request information to be deleted, it’s unclear if the framework
    will be able to uphold people’s rights concerning LLMs, as to Renieris’s earlier
    point, “it’s hard to maintain neat delineations between a data subject, controller,
    & processor” [[36]](https://twitter.com/lilianedwards/status/1643027497615859716).
    As we’ll discuss in detail in chapter 8, the identified shortcomings are precisely
    the reason the EU introduced the AI Act, which is meant to complement GDPR.
