<h1><span class="label">Chapter 5. </span>Real-World AI Applications with AWS Tools</h1>
<p>The Second Industrial Revolution,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="real-world applications of AWS tools" data-secondary="about" id="id1259"/> from 1870 to 1914, was a period that experienced strong economic growth, especially in the US. A key driver was the adoption of electricity, which led to the assembly line, sophisticated machine tools, improved transportation, and better communications.</p>
<p>Some experts say that something similar is happening with today’s AI revolution.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="economic growth from AI adoption" id="id1260"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="economic growth from" id="id1261"/> The technology has broad applications and is expected to be a major driver of long-term growth.</p>
<p>Consider research from PwC. It estimates that AI has the potential to add <a href="https://oreil.ly/FxEhl">$15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030</a>. This is more than the size of China and India’s output combined.</p>
<p>According to the report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our research also shows that 45% of total economic gains by 2030 will come from product enhancements, stimulating consumer demand. This is because AI will drive greater product variety, with increased personalization, attractiveness, and affordability over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To better understand the scale and scope of AI’s potential, it helps to examine how it’s already transforming specific domains. From visual recognition to fraud prevention, AI is redefining what’s possible across industries.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll explore key use cases—such as computer vision, natural language processing, intelligent document processing, and fraud detection—to see the real-world impact in action.</p>
<p>We’ll also look at strategies and approaches for best leveraging this technology, such as selecting generative AI solutions and using prompt engineering.</p>

<p>In 1966, MIT professor and<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="real-world applications of AWS tools" data-secondary="computer vision" id="id1262"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="computer vision" id="id1263"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Minsky, Marvin" id="id1264"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Sussman, Gerald Jay" id="id1265"/> AI pioneer Marvin Minsky tasked his student, Gerald Jay Sussman, with connecting a camera to a computer to see if it could interpret its environment. This “Vision Project” marked the emergence of computer vision but proved exceedingly difficult due to the limited systems and algorithms of the time.</p>
<p>The first practical application<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="OCR (optical character recognition)" data-secondary="computer vision" id="id1266"/> of computer vision, OCR, appeared in the mid-1970s for processing documents and invoices. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="convolutional neural networks (CNNs)" data-secondary="image recognition via" id="id1267"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="neural networks" data-secondary="convolutional neural networks" id="id1268"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="deep learning" data-secondary="image recognition via CNN" id="id1269"/>However, the field saw its next major leap in 2012, when a deep learning model using a convolutional neural network (CNN) demonstrated remarkable image recognition capabilities. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Li, Fei-Fei" id="id1270"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ImageNet dataset" id="id1271"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="labeled data" data-secondary="ImageNet dataset" id="id1272"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="labeled data" data-tertiary="ImageNet dataset" id="id1273"/>A key catalyst for this was ImageNet, a large dataset of over 14 million labeled images developed by researcher Fei-Fei Li, which provided a benchmark for measuring the accuracy of computer vision systems.</p>

<h1>Amazon Rekognition</h1>
<p>AWS has a computer vision service<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="computer vision" data-secondary="Amazon Rekognition" id="c05rek"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Rekognition" id="c05rek2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="real-world applications of AWS tools" data-secondary="computer vision" data-tertiary="Amazon Rekognition" id="c05rek3"/> called Amazon Rekognition, which is for the recognition and analysis of images and videos. The system is based on state-of-the-art deep learning models and trained on massive amounts of data. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="software development kit (SDK)" data-secondary="Amazon Rekognition" id="id1274"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Rekognition" data-secondary="software development kit" id="id1275"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="computer vision" data-secondary="Amazon Rekognition" data-tertiary="software development kit" id="id1276"/>AWS provides a software development kit (SDK), which allows you to implement Amazon Rekognition in your applications. Let’s try out Amazon Rekognition using the following steps (see <a data-type="xref" href="#figure_five_onedot_the_demo_for_the_fac">Figure 5-1</a>:<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Rekognition" data-secondary="trying out" id="id1277"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="computer vision" data-secondary="Amazon Rekognition" data-tertiary="trying out" id="id1278"/></p>

<p>The woman’s face is surrounded by a bounding box, which identifies objects. On the right side of the screen, you will see the details for it. The probability—or confidence score—is 99.9% that this is a face and 98.7% that this is a female. The system estimates her age range to be 24–30, along with other details.</p>
<p>You can also get JSON format for the details of the bounding box by selecting Request or Response (this is a lightweight data format used to store and exchange data). This allows you to use the information in your application.</p>

<h1 class="less_space">Natural Language Processing</h1>
<p>Natural language processing (NLP) is<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="natural language processing (NLP)" data-secondary="about" id="id1282"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="real-world applications of AWS tools" data-secondary="natural language processing" id="id1283"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="natural language processing (NLP)" data-secondary="real-world applications" id="id1284"/> a category of AI that allows computers to understand and communicate with human language. This is the technology that is at the heart of chatbots like ChatGPT, Siri, Cortana, and Amazon Q.</p>
<p>To deal with the complexities, the NLP process involves considerable text processing.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="natural language processing (NLP)" data-secondary="dataset preparation" id="id1285"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data processing" data-secondary="natural language processing" id="id1286"/> This is about cleaning up the dataset to make it so that the AI model can process it effectively.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the techniques:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Lemmatization</dt>
<dd><p>This is a process of<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="lemmatization" id="id1287"/> transforming a word to its root or <em>lemma</em>, which removes affixes and suffixes. For example, the word <em>running</em> is turned into <em>run</em>. Lemmatization helps to find better matches as there is a broader meaning. It is also a common approach with search engines.</p></dd>
<dt>Stemming</dt>
<dd><p>This technique also reduces<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="stemming" id="id1288"/> a word to its root form, but it does so by chopping off the ends of words without considering context. For example, the words <em>running</em>, <em>runs</em>, and <em>runner</em> might all be reduced to <em>run</em>. It’s a faster, more rule-based method than lemmatization, though it may result in less accurate roots.</p></dd>
<dt>Lowercasing</dt>
<dd><p>This converts all the text to lowercase, which helps provide more consistency.</p></dd>
<dt>Stopword removal</dt>
<dd><p>A stopword is a word that may add little meaning, such as <em>the</em> and <em>is</em>.</p></dd>
<dt>Punctuation removal</dt>
<dd><p>For NLP purposes, much of punctuation does not add value. Also, there may be word conversions, such as <em>can’t</em> to <em>cannot</em>.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>Given these factors, the development of NLP systems often involve experts in linguistics, not just data science. There needs to be people who have a deep understanding of languages. Then there may be domain experts, such as people who understand the complex terminology of a category like law or medicine.</p>
<p>AWS has a myriad of services for NLP:<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="natural language processing (NLP)" data-secondary="real-world applications" data-tertiary="AWS services" id="c05awsnlp"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="real-world applications of AWS tools" data-secondary="natural language processing" data-tertiary="AWS services" id="c05awsnlp2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Comprehend" data-secondary="natural language processing" id="id1289"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Kendra" data-secondary="natural language processing" id="id1290"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Lex" data-secondary="natural language processing" id="id1291"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Polly" data-secondary="natural language processing" id="id1292"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Transcribe" data-secondary="natural language processing" id="id1293"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Translate" data-secondary="natural language processing" id="id1294"/></p>

The system will crawl multiple data sources in an organization. Just some of them include Amazon RDS, Amazon S3 buckets, Box, Dropbox, Gmail, SharePoint, Slack, and GitHub.</p>
<p>Amazon Kendra is based on an advanced form of RAG, which allows for highly accurate results. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="chatbots" data-secondary="Amazon Kendra" id="id1303"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="knowledge bases via Amazon Kendra" id="id1304"/>With Kendra, you can use it as the source for a chatbot experience or for creating resources like knowledge bases. The service has two approaches for indexing the information:</p>
<dl>
<dt>GenAI Enterprise Edition</dt>
<dd><p>This uses the most sophisticated RAG system and semantic models. It is designed for production-level applications that can handle large workloads.</p></dd>
<dt>Basic Enterprise Edition</dt>
<dd><p>While powerful, the RAG capabilities are not as advanced as those for the GenAI Enterprise Edition. This system is also not meant for production-level applications; it is mostly for proof-of-concept projects.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>With Amazon Kendra, you can ask it these types of questions:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Factoid questions</dt>
<dd><p>This is about answering who, what, when, or where about a topic. An example is: “What is the customer support phone number for Acme Corp?”</p></dd>
<dt>Descriptive questions</dt>
<dd><p>This provides for more detailed answers, which often have step-by-step explanations. Some examples include: “How do I reset my company email password?” “What are the steps to setup an IRA?”</p></dd>
<dt>Keyword and natural language questions</dt>
<dd><p>This question includes complex and conversational queries. There are often words with different meanings. For example, in “How do I set up a business account?” the word <em>account</em> could mean a financial account, login, or customer profile.

<dd><p>Depending on your audience, you may have to meet the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p></dd>
<dt>Intents</dt>
<dd><p>These are the actions that the user wants to perform, such as for booking a hotel room. An intent has a name and description, as well as sample utterances that will invoke the action. Examples include “please book a hotel room” or “reserve a hotel room.”</p></dd>
<dt>Configure slots</dt>
<dd><p>This process provides details needed from the user to fulfill the intent. This could be getting information about the destination, check-in data, room type, and number of nights.</p></dd>
<dt>Set up the fulfillment</dt>
<dd><p>This is how the user request will be processed. It could involve using AWS Lambda functions to connect to a hotel’s booking system.</p></dd>
<dt>Deployment</dt>

<h1>Intelligent Document Processing</h1>
<p>Intelligent document processing (IDP) <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="real-world applications of AWS tools" data-secondary="intelligent document processing" id="id1324"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intelligent document processing (IDP)" id="id1325"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="natural language processing (NLP)" data-secondary="intelligent document processing versus" id="id1326"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intelligent document processing (IDP)" data-secondary="natural language processing versus" id="id1327"/>is similar to NLP. Both extract meaning from text, and they use AI to do this. Yet there are clear differences between the two. Whereas NLP has broad applications—such as for chatbots, language translation, and sentiment analysis—IDP is focused on automating the extraction, classification, and processing of data. Generally, this is for business purposes, such as handling invoices and contracts.</p>
<p>Moreover, IDP will use other types of technologies,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="robotic process automation (RPA)" data-secondary="intelligent document processing using" id="id1328"/> such as robotic process automation (RPA). This uses software bots to automate routine and tedious tasks and processes. They will often mimic human actions like filling in forms and clicking buttons. This can be done at high volumes.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, let’s take an example. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="electronic health record (EHR) system and intelligent document processing" id="id1329"/>Suppose a hospital receives patient referrals from different clinics, and all have different formats, such as PDFs, scanned documents, and handwritten notes. When done manually, the workflow would involve a review of the documents from the administrative staff, the extraction of relevant details—like the patient names, diagnoses, and referring physicians—and the entering of information into the hospital’s electronic health record (EHR) system. No doubt, the process takes considerable time and is prone to error.</p>
<p class="pagebreak-before">But with IDP, you can greatly streamline the workflows:<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="OCR (optical character recognition)" data-secondary="electronic health record system and intelligent document processing" id="id1330"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="robotic process automation (RPA)" data-secondary="intelligent document processing using" data-tertiary="electronic health record system example" id="id1331"/></p>

<dd><p>Using an RPA system, you can validate the accuracy of the data with the hospital’s database. After this, you can update the EHR system.</p></dd>

<p>An AWS tool for IDP is Amazon Textract.<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="intelligent document processing (IDP)" data-secondary="Amazon Textract" id="id1332"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Textract" id="id1333"/> The following are the steps for how to use this service:<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Textract" data-secondary="trying out" id="id1334"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="OCR (optical character recognition)" data-secondary="Amazon Textract" id="id1335"/></p>

<h1>Fraud Detection</h1>
<p>Fraud is a huge problem for<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="real-world applications of AWS tools" data-secondary="fraud detection" id="id1336"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fraud detection" id="id1337"/> the financial services industry. In 2023, the losses were more than $480 billion.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="ch01fn24-marker" href="ch05.html#ch01fn24">1</a></sup> To combat fraud, financial services firms spend substantial amounts on software.</p>
<p>A big part of this is the use of AI. Techniques like classification and clustering can be helpful in detecting fraud. The same goes with using anomaly detection, which will look for outliers and unusual patterns in data. Generative AI has been useful for this approach.</p>
<p>Amazon Fraud Detector <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Amazon Fraud Detector" id="id1338"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fraud detection" data-secondary="Amazon Fraud Detector" id="id1339"/>is a fully managed service for detecting fraudulent online activities. The process involves:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Selecting a model for a specific use case, like online transaction fraud or new account fraud</p></li>
<li><p>Building a dataset of fraud event details and uploading it to Amazon S3</p></li>
<li><p>Training the model on your dataset</p></li>
<li><p>Building a detector by establishing rules to interpret the model’s predictions and determine whether to approve, flag, or deny a transaction</p></li>

<h1>When to Use AI?</h1>
<p>As we have seen in this chapter,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="real-world applications of AWS tools" data-secondary="when to use AI" id="id1340"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="when to use" data-seealso="real-world applications of AWS tools" id="id1341"/> there are many applications for AI. But this powerful technology should not always be used. For example, there may be cases when a simple software solution will be the best option. This could be using RPA for data entry or mapping routine processes. If you used AI for this, it would likely involve a complex implementation and be costly. It would essentially be overkill.</p>
<p>This brings up another important challenge: the need for deterministic outcomes. In certain high-stakes fields—such as healthcare or financial services—software is expected to produce consistent, reliable, and accurate results. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="generative AI" data-secondary="about" id="id1342"/>But generative AI models often introduce variability in their responses. This unpredictability can be risky because even small deviations or inaccuracies could lead to serious consequences, like a misdiagnosis or financial error.</p>
