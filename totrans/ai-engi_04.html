      <h1><span class="label">Chapter 4. </span>Evaluate AI Systems</h1>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="systems evaluation" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html0"/>A model is only useful if it works for its intended purposes. You need to evaluate models in the context of your application. <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03a_evaluation_methodology_1730150757064067">Chapter 3</a> discusses different approaches to automatic evaluation. This chapter discusses how to use these approaches to evaluate models for your applications.</p>&#13;
<p>This chapter contains three parts. It starts with a discussion of the criteria you might use to evaluate your applications and how these criteria are defined and calculated. For example, many people worry about AI making up facts—how is factual consistency detected? How are domain-specific capabilities like math, science, reasoning, and summarization measured?</p>&#13;
<p>The second part focuses on model selection. Given an increasing number of foundation models to choose from, it can feel overwhelming to choose the right model for your application. Thousands of benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate these models along different criteria. Can these benchmarks be trusted? How do you select what benchmarks to use? How about public leaderboards that aggregate multiple benchmarks?</p>&#13;
<p>The model landscape is teeming with proprietary models and open source models. A question many teams will need to visit over and over again is whether to host their own models or to use a model API. This question has become more nuanced with the introduction of model API services built on top of open source models.</p>&#13;
<p>The last part discusses developing an evaluation pipeline that can guide the development of your application over time. This part brings together the techniques we’ve learned throughout the book to evaluate concrete applications.</p>&#13;
      <section data-pdf-bookmark="Evaluation Criteria" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch04_evaluation_criteria_1730130866188384">&#13;
        <h1>Evaluation Criteria</h1>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="systems evaluation" data-secondary="evaluation criteria" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html1"/>Which is worse—an application that has never been deployed or an application that is deployed but no one knows whether it’s working? When I asked this question at conferences, most people said the latter. An application that is deployed but can’t be evaluated is worse. It costs to maintain, but if you want to take it down, it might cost even more.</p>&#13;
<p>AI applications with questionable returns on investment are, unfortunately, quite common. This happens not only because the application is hard to evaluate but also because application developers don’t have visibility into how their applications are being used. An ML engineer at a used car dealership told me that his team built a model to predict the value of a car based on the specs given by the owner. A year after the model was deployed, their users seemed to like the feature, but he had no idea if the model’s predictions were accurate. At the beginning of the ChatGPT fever, companies rushed to deploy customer support chatbots. Many of them are still unsure if these chatbots help or hurt their user experience.</p>&#13;
<p>Before investing time, money, and resources into building an application, it’s important to understand how this application will be evaluated. I call this approach <em>evaluation-driven development</em>. The name is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"><em>test-driven development</em></a> in software engineering, which refers to the method of writing tests before writing code. In AI engineering, evaluation-driven development means defining evaluation criteria before building.</p>&#13;
        <aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="ch04_evaluation_driven_development_1730130866188490">&#13;
          <h1>Evaluation-Driven Development</h1>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="evaluation-driven development" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="systems evaluation" data-secondary="evaluation criteria" data-tertiary="evaluation-driven development" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html3"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="systems evaluation" data-secondary="evaluation-driven development" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html4"/>While some companies chase the latest hype, sensible business decisions are still being made based on returns on investment, not hype. Applications should demonstrate value to be deployed. As a result, the most common enterprise applications in production are those with clear evaluation criteria:</p>&#13;
          <ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Recommender systems are common because their successes can be evaluated by an increase in engagement or purchase-through rates.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id989" id="id989-marker">1</a></sup></p></li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>The success of a fraud detection system can be measured by how much money is saved from prevented frauds.</p></li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Coding is a common generative AI use case because, unlike other generation tasks, generated code can be evaluated using functional correctness.</p></li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Even though foundation models are open-ended, many of their use cases are close-ended, such as intent classification, sentiment analysis, next-action prediction, etc. It’s much easier to evaluate classification tasks than open-ended tasks.</p></li>&#13;
          </ul>&#13;
<p>While the evaluation-driven development approach makes sense from a business perspective, focusing only on applications whose outcomes can be measured is similar to looking for the lost key under the lamppost (at night). It’s easier to do, but it doesn’t mean we’ll find the key. We might be missing out on many potentially game-changing applications because there is no easy way to evaluate them.</p>&#13;
<p>I believe that evaluation is the biggest bottleneck to AI adoption. Being able to build reliable evaluation pipelines will unlock many new applications.</p>&#13;
        </div></aside>&#13;
<p>An AI application, therefore, should start with a list of evaluation criteria specific to the application. In general, you can think of criteria in the following buckets: domain-specific capability, generation capability, instruction-following capability, and cost and latency.</p>&#13;
<p>Imagine you ask a model to summarize a legal contract. At a high level, domain-specific capability metrics tell you how good the model is at understanding legal contracts. Generation capability metrics measure how coherent or faithful the summary is. Instruction-following capability determines whether the summary is in the requested format, such as meeting your length constraints. Cost and latency metrics tell you how much this summary will cost you and how long you will have to wait for it.</p>&#13;
<p>The last chapter started with an evaluation approach and discussed what criteria a given approach can evaluate. This section takes a different angle: given a criterion, what approaches can you use to evaluate it?<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html4" data-type="indexterm" id="id990"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html3" data-type="indexterm" id="id991"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html2" data-type="indexterm" id="id992"/></p>&#13;
        <section data-pdf-bookmark="Domain-Specific Capability" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_domain_specific_capability_1730130866188564">&#13;
          <h2>Domain-Specific Capability</h2>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="domain-specific capability" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html5"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="systems evaluation" data-secondary="evaluation criteria" data-tertiary="domain-specific capability" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html6"/>To build a coding agent, you need a model that can write code. To build an application to translate from Latin to English, you need a model that understands both Latin and English. Coding and English–Latin understanding are domain-specific capabilities. A model’s domain-specific capabilities are constrained by its configuration (such as model architecture and size) and training data. If a model never saw Latin during its training process, it won’t be able to understand Latin. Models that don’t have the capabilities your application requires won’t work for you.</p>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="benchmarks" data-secondary="domain-specific" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html5a"/>To evaluate whether a model has the necessary capabilities, you can rely on domain-specific benchmarks, either public or private. Thousands of public benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate seemingly endless capabilities, including code generation, code debugging, grade school math, science knowledge, common sense, reasoning, legal knowledge, tool use, game playing, etc. The list goes on.</p>&#13;
<p>Domain-specific capabilities are commonly evaluated using exact evaluation. Coding-related capabilities are typically evaluated using functional correctness, as discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03a_evaluation_methodology_1730150757064067">Chapter 3</a>. While functional correctness is important, it might not be the only aspect that you care about. You might also care about efficiency and cost. For example, would you want a car that runs but consumes an excessive amount of fuel? Similarly, if an SQL query generated by your text-to-SQL model is correct but takes too long or requires too much memory to run, it might not be usable. </p>&#13;
<p>Efficiency can be exactly evaluated by measuring runtime or memory usage. <a href="https://oreil.ly/mOAjn">BIRD-SQL</a> (Li et al., 2023) is an example of a benchmark that takes into account not only the generated query’s execution accuracy but also its efficiency, which is measured by comparing the runtime of the generated query with the runtime of the ground truth SQL query.</p>&#13;
<p>You might also care about code readability. If the generated code runs but nobody can understand it, it will be challenging to maintain the code or incorporate it into a system. There’s no obvious way to evaluate code readability exactly, so you might have to rely on subjective evaluation, such as using AI judges.</p>&#13;
<p>Non-coding domain capabilities are often evaluated with close-ended tasks, such as multiple-choice questions. Close-ended outputs are easier to verify and reproduce. For example, if you want to evaluate a model’s ability to do math, an open-ended approach is to ask the model to generate the solution to a given problem. A close-ended approach is to give the model several options and let it pick the correct one. If the expected answer is option C and the model outputs option A, the model is wrong.</p>&#13;
<p>This is the approach that most public benchmarks follow. In April 2024, 75% of <span class="keep-together">the tasks</span> in Eleuther’s <a href="https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/master/docs/task_table.md">lm-evaluation-harness</a> are multiple-choice, including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300">UC Berkeley’s MMLU (2020)</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06364">Microsoft’s AGIEval (2023)</a>, and the <a href="https://oreil.ly/d3ggH">AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC-C) (2018)</a>. In their paper, AGIEval’s authors explained that they excluded open-ended tasks on purpose to avoid inconsistent assessment.</p>&#13;
<p>Here’s an example of a multiple-choice question in the MMLU benchmark:</p>&#13;
          <ul class="simplelist">&#13;
          <li><p>Question: One of the reasons that the government discourages and regulates monopolies is that</p>&#13;
<ul class="simplelist">&#13;
          <li><p>(A) Producer surplus is lost and consumer surplus is gained.</p></li>&#13;
         <li><p>(B) Monopoly prices ensure productive efficiency but cost society allocative efficiency.</p></li>&#13;
          <li><p>(C) Monopoly firms do not engage in significant research and development.</p></li>&#13;
          <li><p>(D) Consumer surplus is lost with higher prices and lower levels of output.</p></li>&#13;
          <li><p>Label: (D)</p></li>&#13;
        </ul>&#13;
      </li>&#13;
        </ul>&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before"><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="MCQs (multiple-choice questions)" data-type="indexterm" id="id993"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="multiple-choice questions (MCQs)" data-type="indexterm" id="id994"/>A multiple-choice question (MCQ) might have one or more correct answers. A common metric is accuracy—how many questions the model gets right. Some tasks use a point system to grade a model’s performance—harder questions are worth more points. You can also use a point system when there are multiple correct options. A model gets one point for each option it gets right.</p>&#13;
<p>Classification is a special case of multiple choice where the choices are the same for all questions. For example, for a tweet sentiment classification task, each question has the same three choices: NEGATIVE, POSITIVE, and NEUTRAL. Metrics for classification tasks, other than accuracy, include F1 scores, precision, and recall.</p>&#13;
<p>MCQs are popular because they are easy to create, verify, and evaluate against the random baseline. If each question has four options and only one correct option, the random baseline accuracy would be 25%. Scores above 25% typically, though not always, mean that the model is doing better than random.</p>&#13;
<p>A drawback of using MCQs is that a model’s performance on MCQs can vary with small changes in how the questions and the options are presented. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01781">Alzahrani et al. (2024)</a> found that the introduction of an extra space between the question and answer or an addition of an additional instructional phrase, such as “Choices:” can cause the model to change its answers. Models’ sensitivity to prompts and prompt engineering best practices are discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05a_prompt_engineering_1730156991195551">Chapter 5</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>Despite the prevalence of close-ended benchmarks, it’s unclear if they are a good way to evaluate foundation models. MCQs test the ability to differentiate good responses from bad responses (classification), which is different from the ability to generate good responses. MCQs are best suited for evaluating knowledge (“does the model know that Paris is the capital of France?”) and reasoning (“can the model infer from a table of business expenses which department is spending the most?”). They aren’t ideal for evaluating generation capabilities such as summarization, translation, and essay writing. Let’s discuss how generation capabilities can be evaluated in the next section.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html6" data-type="indexterm" id="id995"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html5" data-type="indexterm" id="id996"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html5a" data-type="indexterm" id="id997"/></p>&#13;

          <h2>Generation Capability</h2>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="metrics" data-secondary="for generation capability" data-secondary-sortas="generation capability" data-type="indexterm" id="id998"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="generation capability" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html7"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="natural language generation (NLG)" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html8"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="natural language processing (NLP)" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html9"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="systems evaluation" data-secondary="evaluation criteria" data-tertiary="generation capability" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html10"/>AI was used to generate open-ended outputs long before generative AI became a thing. For decades, the brightest minds in NLP (natural language processing) have been working on how to evaluate the quality of open-ended outputs. The subfield that studies open-ended text generation is called NLG (natural language generation). NLG tasks in the early 2010s included translation, summarization, and paraphrasing.</p>&#13;
<p>Metrics used to evaluate the quality of generated texts back then included <em>fluency</em> and <em>coherence</em>. Fluency measures whether the text is grammatically correct and natural-sounding (does this sound like something written by a fluent speaker?). Coherence measures how well-structured the whole text is (does it follow a logical structure?). Each task might also have its own metrics. For example, a metric a translation task might use is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="faithfulness" data-type="indexterm" id="id999"/><em>faithfulness</em>: how faithful is the generated translation to the original sentence? A metric that a summarization task might use is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="relevance" data-type="indexterm" id="id1000"/><em>relevance</em>: does the summary focus on the most important aspects of the source document? (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05227">Li et al., 2022</a>).</p>&#13;
<p>Some early NLG metrics, including <em>faithfulness</em> and <em>relevance</em>, have been repurposed, with significant modifications, to evaluate the outputs of foundation models. As generative models improved, many issues of early NLG systems went away, and the metrics used to track these issues became less important. In the 2010s, generated texts didn’t sound natural. They were typically full of grammatical errors and awkward sentences. Fluency and coherence, then, were important metrics to track. However, as language models’ generation capabilities have improved, AI-generated texts have become nearly indistinguishable from human-generated texts. Fluency and coherence become less important.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1001" id="id1001-marker">2</a></sup> However, these metrics can still be useful for weaker models or for applications involving creative writing and low-resource languages. Fluency and coherence can be evaluated using AI as a judge—asking an AI model how fluent and coherent a text is—or using perplexity, as discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03a_evaluation_methodology_1730150757064067">Chapter 3</a>. </p>&#13;
<p>Generative models, with their new capabilities and new use cases, have new issues that require new metrics to track. The most pressing issue is undesired hallucinations. Hallucinations are desirable for creative tasks, not for tasks that depend on factuality. A metric that many application developers want to measure is <em>factual consistency</em>. Another issue commonly tracked is safety: can the generated outputs cause harm to users and society? Safety is an umbrella term for all types of toxicity and biases.</p>&#13;
<p>There are many other measurements that an application developer might care about. For example, when I built my AI-powered writing assistant, I cared about <em>controversiality</em>, which measures content that isn’t necessarily harmful but can cause heated debates. Some people might care about <em>friendliness, positivity, creativity,</em> or<em> conciseness</em>, but I won’t be able to go into them all. This section focuses on how to evaluate factual consistency and safety. Factual inconsistency can cause harm too, so it’s technically under safety. However, due to its scope, I put it in its own section. The techniques used to measure these qualities can give you a rough idea of how to evaluate other qualities you care about.</p>&#13;
          <section class="pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="Factual consistency" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch04_factual_consistency_1730130866188737">&#13;
            <h3 class="less_space">Factual consistency</h3>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="factual consistency" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html11"/>Due to factual inconsistency’s potential for catastrophic consequences, many techniques have been and will be developed to detect and measure it. It’s impossible to cover them all in one chapter, so I’ll go over only the broad strokes.</p>&#13;
<p>The factual consistency of a model’s output can be verified under two settings: against explicitly provided facts (context) or against open knowledge:</p>&#13;
            <dl>&#13;
              <dt>Local factual consistency</dt>&#13;
<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="local factual consistency" data-type="indexterm" id="id1002"/>The output is evaluated against a context. The output is considered factually consistent if it’s supported by the given context. For example, if the model outputs “the sky is blue” and the given context says that the sky is purple, this output is considered factually inconsistent. Conversely, given this context, if the model outputs “the sky is purple”, this output is factually consistent.</p></dd>&#13;
<dd><p>Local factual consistency is important for tasks with limited scopes such as summarization (the summary should be consistent with the original document), customer support chatbots (the chatbot’s responses should be consistent with the company’s policies), and business analysis (the extracted insights should be consistent with the data).</p></dd>&#13;
              <dt>Global factual consistency </dt>&#13;
<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="global factual consistency" data-type="indexterm" id="id1003"/>The output is evaluated against open knowledge. If the model outputs “the sky is blue” and it’s a commonly accepted fact that the sky is blue, this statement is considered factually correct. Global factual consistency is important for tasks with broad scopes such as general chatbots, fact-checking, market research, etc.</p></dd>&#13;
            </dl>&#13;
<p>Factual consistency is much easier to verify against explicit facts. For example, the factual consistency of the statement “there has been no proven link between vaccination and autism” is easier to verify if you’re provided with reliable sources that explicitly state whether there is a link between vaccination and autism.</p>&#13;
<p>If no context is given, you’ll have to first search for reliable sources, derive facts, and then validate the statement against these facts.</p>&#13;
<p>Often, the hardest part of factual consistency verification is determining what the facts are. Whether any of the following statements can be considered factual depends on what sources you trust: “Messi is the best soccer player in the world”, “climate change is one of the most pressing crises of our time”, “breakfast is the most important meal of the day”. The internet is flooded with misinformation: false marketing claims, statistics made up to advance political agendas, and sensational, biased social media posts. In addition, it’s easy to fall for the absence of evidence fallacy. One might take the statement “there’s no link between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>” as factually correct because of a failure to find the evidence that supported the link.</p>&#13;
<p>One interesting research question is what evidence AI models find convincing, as the answer sheds light on how AI models process conflicting information and determine what the facts are. For example, <a href="https://oreil.ly/hJucg">Wan et al. (2024)</a> found that existing “models rely heavily on the relevance of a website to the query, while largely ignoring stylistic features that humans find important such as whether a text contains scientific references or is written with a neutral tone.”</p>&#13;
            <div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="metrics" data-secondary="for hallucination measurement" data-secondary-sortas="hallucination" data-type="indexterm" id="id1004"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hallucinations" data-secondary="measurement" data-type="indexterm" id="id1005"/>When designing metrics to measure hallucinations, it’s important to analyze the model’s outputs to understand the types of queries that it is more likely to hallucinate on. Your benchmark should focus more on these queries.</p>&#13;
<p>For example, in one of my projects, I found that the model I was working with tended to hallucinate on two types of queries:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p>Queries that involve niche knowledge. For example, it was more likely to hallucinate when I asked it about the VMO (Vietnamese Mathematical Olympiad) than the IMO (International Mathematical Olympiad), because the VMO is much less commonly referenced than the IMO.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Queries asking for things that don’t exist. For example, if I ask the model “What did <em>X</em> say about <em>Y</em>?” the model is more likely to hallucinate if <em>X</em> has never said anything about <em>Y</em> than if <em>X</em> has.</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
            </div>&#13;
<p>Let’s assume for now that you already have the context to evaluate an output <span class="keep-together">against—this</span> context was either provided by users or retrieved by you (context retrieval is discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06_rag_and_agents_1730157386571386">Chapter 6</a>). The most straightforward evaluation approach is AI as a judge. As discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03a_evaluation_methodology_1730150757064067">Chapter 3</a>, AI judges can be asked to evaluate anything, including factual consistency. Both <a href="https://oreil.ly/HnIVp">Liu et al. (2023)</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15621">Luo et al. (2023)</a> showed that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can outperform previous methods at measuring factual consistency. The paper <a href="https://oreil.ly/xvYjL">“TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods”</a> (Lin et al., 2022) shows that their finetuned model GPT-judge is able to predict whether a statement is considered truthful by humans with 90–96% accuracy. Here’s the prompt that Liu et al. (2023) used to evaluate the factual consistency of a summary with respect to the original document:<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1006" id="id1006-marker">3</a></sup></p>&#13;
<pre class="less_space pagebreak-before" data-type="programlisting">Factual Consistency: Does the summary untruthful or misleading facts that are &#13;

{{Summary}}&#13;
Does the summary contain factual inconsistency?&#13;

            </pre>&#13;
<p>More sophisticated AI as a judge techniques to evaluate factual consistency are self-verification and knowledge-augmented verification:</p>&#13;
            <dl>&#13;
              <dt>Self-verification</dt>&#13;
<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="self-verification" data-type="indexterm" id="id1007"/>SelfCheckGPT (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08896">Manakul et al., 2023</a>) relies on an assumption that if a model generates multiple outputs that disagree with one another, the original output is likely hallucinated. Given a response R to evaluate, SelfCheckGPT generates N new responses and measures how consistent R is with respect to these N new responses. This approach works but can be prohibitively expensive, as it requires many AI queries to evaluate a response.</p></dd>&#13;

<p>Verifying whether a statement is consistent with a given context can also be framed as <em>textual entailment</em>, which is a long-standing NLP task.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1009" id="id1009-marker">4</a></sup> Textual entailment is the task of determining the relationship between two statements. Given a premise (context), it determines which category a hypothesis (the output or part of the output) falls into:</p>&#13;
            <ul>&#13;
<li><p>Entailment: the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Contradiction: the hypothesis contradicts the premise.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Neutral: the premise neither entails nor contradicts the hypothesis.</p></li>&#13;
            </ul>&#13;
<p>For example, given the context “Mary likes all fruits”, here are examples of these three relationships:</p>&#13;
            <ul>&#13;
<li><p>Entailment: “Mary likes apples”.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Contradiction: “Mary hates oranges”.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Neutral: “Mary likes chickens”.</p></li>&#13;
            </ul>&#13;
<p>Entailment implies factual consistency, contradiction implies factual inconsistency, and neutral implies that consistency can’t be determined.</p>&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">Instead of using general-purpose AI judges, you can train scorers specialized in <span class="keep-together">factual</span> consistency prediction. These scorers take in a pair of (premise, hypothesis) as input and output one of the predefined classes, such as entailment, contradiction, <span class="keep-together">or neutral.</span> This makes factual consistency a classification task. For example, <a href="https://oreil.ly/ICHH3"><code>DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli</code></a> is a 184-million-parameter model trained on 764,000 annotated (hypothesis, premise) pairs to predict <span class="keep-together">entailment.</span></p>&#13;
<p>Benchmarks for factual consistency include TruthfulQA. It comprises 817 questions that some humans would answer incorrectly due to a false belief or misconception. These questions span 38 categories, including health, law, finance, and politics. This benchmark comes with a specialized AI judge, GPT-judge, that was finetuned to automatically evaluate whether a response is factually consistent with the reference response. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_table_1_1730130866138300">Table 4-1</a> shows example questions and false answers generated by GPT-3.</p>&#13;

Different safety solutions have different ways of categorizing harms—see the taxonomy defined in OpenAI’s <a href="https://oreil.ly/ZRwVI">content moderation</a> endpoint and Meta’s Llama Guard paper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06674">Inan et al., 2023</a>). <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05a_prompt_engineering_1730156991195551">Chapter 5</a> also discusses more ways in which AI models can be unsafe and how to make your systems more robust. In general, unsafe content might belong to one of the following categories:</p>&#13;
            <ol>&#13;
<li><p>Inappropriate language, including profanity and explicit content.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Harmful recommendations and tutorials, such as “step-by-step guide to rob a bank” or encouraging users to engage in self-destructive behavior.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Hate speech, including racist, sexist, homophobic speech, and other discriminatory behaviors.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Violence, including threats and graphic detail.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Stereotypes, such as always using female names for nurses or male names for CEOs.</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
&#13;
<ol class="less_space pagebreak-before" start="6">&#13;
<li><p>Biases toward a political or religious ideology, which can lead to the model generating only content that supports this ideology. For example, studies (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08283">Feng et <span class="keep-together">al., 2023</span></a>; <a href="https://oreil.ly/u9_vA">Motoki et al., 2023</a>; and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01768">Hartman et al., 2023</a>) have shown that models, depending on their training, can be imbued with political biases. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 is more left-winged and libertarian-leaning, whereas Meta’s Llama is more authoritarian, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_3_1730130866113594">Figure 4-3</a>.</p>&#13;

<p>It’s possible to use general-purpose AI judges to detect these scenarios, and many people do. GPTs, Claude, and Gemini can detect many harmful outputs if prompted properly.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1011" id="id1011-marker">5</a></sup> These model providers also need to develop moderation tools to keep their models safe, and some of them expose their moderation tools for external use.</p>&#13;
<p>Harmful behaviors aren’t unique to AI outputs. They’re unfortunately extremely common online. Many models developed to detect toxicity in human-generated texts can be used for AI-generated texts. These specialized models tend to be much smaller, faster, and cheaper than general-purpose AI judges. Examples of these <span class="keep-together">models</span> are <a href="https://oreil.ly/BndEu">Facebook’s hate speech detection model</a>, the <a href="https://oreil.ly/2aIvB">Skolkovo Institute’s toxicity classifier</a>, and <a href="https://oreil.ly/0VrKU">Perspective API</a>. There are also many toxicity and hate speech detection models specialized in different languages, such as <a href="https://oreil.ly/70VH1">Danish</a> and <span class="keep-together"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12162">Vietnamese</a></span>.</p>&#13;
<p>Common benchmarks to measure toxicity include RealToxicityPrompts (<a href="https://oreil.ly/Bfa4q">Gehman et al., 2020</a>) and BOLD (bias in open-ended language generation dataset) (<a href="https://oreil.ly/aFvUh">Dhamala et al., 2021</a>).

          <h2>Instruction-Following Capability</h2>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="instruction-following capability" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html14"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="systems evaluation" data-secondary="evaluation criteria" data-tertiary="instruction-following capability" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html15"/>Instruction-following measurement asks the question: how good is this model at following the instructions you give it? If the model is bad at following instructions, it doesn’t matter how good your instructions are, the outputs will be bad. Being able to follow instructions is a core requirement for foundation models, and most foundation models are trained to do so. InstructGPT, the predecessor of ChatGPT, was named so because it was finetuned for following instructions. More powerful models are generally better at following instructions. GPT-4 is better at following most instructions than GPT-3.5, and similarly, Claude-v2 is better at following most instructions than Claude-v1.</p>&#13;
<p>Let’s say you ask the model to detect the sentiment in a tweet and output NEGATIVE, POSITIVE, or NEUTRAL. The model seems to understand the sentiment of each tweet, but it generates unexpected outputs such as HAPPY and ANGRY. This means that the model has the domain-specific capability to do sentiment analysis on tweets, but its instruction-following capability is poor.</p>&#13;
<p>Instruction-following capability is essential for applications that require structured outputs, such as in JSON format or matching a regular expression (regex).<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1018" id="id1018-marker">6</a></sup> For example, if you ask a model to classify an input as A, B, or C, but the model outputs “That’s correct”, this output isn’t very helpful and will likely break downstream applications that expect only A, B, or C.</p>&#13;
<p>But instruction-following capability goes beyond generating structured outputs. If you ask a model to use only words of at most four characters, the model’s outputs don’t have to be structured, but they should still follow the instruction to contain only words of at most four characters. Ello, a startup that helps kids read better, wants to build a system that automatically generates stories for a kid using only the words that they can understand. The model they use needs the ability to follow the instruction to work with a limited pool of words.</p>&#13;
<p>Instruction-following capability isn’t straightforward to define or measure, as it can be easily conflated with domain-specific capability or generation capability. Imagine you ask a model to write a <em>lục bát</em> poem, which is a Vietnamese verse form. If the model fails to do so, it can either be because the model doesn’t know how to write <em>lục bát</em>, or because it doesn’t understand what it’s supposed to do.</p>&#13;
          <div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>How well a model performs depends on the quality of its instructions, which makes it hard to evaluate AI models. When a model performs poorly, it can either be because the model is bad or the instruction is bad.</p>&#13;

The two benchmarks discussed here, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07911">IFEval</a> and <a href="https://oreil.ly/SaIST">INFOBench</a>, measure models’ capability to follow a wide range of instructions, which are to give you ideas on how to evaluate a model’s ability to follow your instructions: what criteria to use, what instructions to include in the evaluation set, and what evaluation methods are appropriate.</p>&#13;
<p>The Google benchmark IFEval, Instruction-Following Evaluation, focuses on whether the model can produce outputs following an expected format. Zhou et al. (2023) identified 25 types of instructions that can be automatically verified, such as keyword inclusion, length constraints, number of bullet points, and JSON format. If you ask a model to write a sentence that uses the word “ephemeral”, you can write a program to check if the output contains this word; hence, this instruction is automatically verifiable. The score is the fraction of the instructions that are followed correctly out of all instructions. Explanations of these instruction types are shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_table_2_1730130866138337">Table 4-2</a>.</p>&#13;

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="IFEval" data-type="indexterm" id="id1019"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="INFOBench" data-type="indexterm" id="id1020"/>INFOBench, created by Qin et al. (2024), takes a much broader view of what instruction-following means. On top of evaluating a model’s ability to follow an expected format like IFEval does, INFOBench also evaluates the model’s ability to follow content constraints (such as “discuss only climate change”), linguistic guidelines (such as “use Victorian English”), and style rules (such as “use a respectful tone”). However, the verification of these expanded instruction types can’t be easily automated. If you instruct a model to “use language appropriate to a young audience”, how do you automatically verify if the output is indeed appropriate for a young audience?</p>&#13;
<p>For verification, INFOBench authors constructed a list of criteria for each instruction, each framed as a yes/no question. For example, the output to the instruction “Make a questionnaire to help hotel guests write hotel reviews” can be verified using three yes/no questions:</p>&#13;
            <ol>&#13;
<li><p>Is the generated text a questionnaire?</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Is the generated questionnaire designed for hotel guests?</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Is the generated questionnaire helpful for hotel guests to write hotel reviews?</p></li>&#13;
            </ol>&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">A model is considered to successfully follow an instruction if its output meets all the criteria for this instruction. Each of these yes/no questions can be answered by a human or AI evaluator. If the instruction has three criteria and the evaluator determines that a model’s output meets two of them, the model’s score for this instruction is 2/3. The final score for a model on this benchmark is the number of criteria a model gets right divided by the total number of criteria for all instructions.</p>&#13;
<p>In their experiment, the INFOBench authors found that GPT-4 is a reasonably reliable and cost-effective evaluator. GPT-4 isn’t as accurate as human experts, but it’s more accurate than annotators recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. They concluded that their benchmark can be automatically verified using AI judges.</p>&#13;
<p>Benchmarks like IFEval and INFOBench are helpful to give you a sense of how good different models are at following instructions. While they both tried to include instructions that are representative of real-world instructions, the sets of instructions they evaluate are different, and they undoubtedly miss many commonly used instructions.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1021" id="id1021-marker">7</a></sup> A model that performs well on these benchmarks might not necessarily perform well on your instructions.</p>&#13;
            <div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>&#13;
<p>You should curate your own benchmark to evaluate your model’s capability to follow your instructions using your own criteria. If you need a model to output YAML, include YAML instructions in your benchmark. If you want a model to not say things like “As a language model”, evaluate the model on this instruction.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html16a" data-type="indexterm" id="id1022"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html16" data-type="indexterm" id="id1023"/></p>&#13;

            <h3>Roleplaying</h3>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="roleplaying" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html17"/>One of the most common types of real-world instructions is roleplaying—asking the model to assume a fictional character or a persona. Roleplaying can serve two <span class="keep-together">purposes:</span></p>&#13;
            <ol>&#13;
<li><p>Roleplaying a character for users to interact with, usually for entertainment, such as in gaming or interactive storytelling</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Roleplaying as a prompt engineering technique to improve the quality of a model’s outputs, as discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05a_prompt_engineering_1730156991195551">Chapter 5</a></p></li>&#13;
            </ol>&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">For either purpose, roleplaying is very common. LMSYS’s analysis of one million conversations from their Vicuna demo and Chatbot Arena (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11998">Zheng et al., 2023</a>) shows that roleplaying is their eighth most common use case, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_4_1730130866113621">Figure 4-4</a>. Roleplaying is especially important for AI-powered NPCs (non-playable characters) in gaming, AI companions, and writing assistants.</p>&#13;

Benchmarks to evaluate <span class="keep-together">roleplaying</span> capability include RoleLLM (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00746">Wang et al., 2023</a>) and CharacterEval (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01275">Tu et al., 2024</a>). CharacterEval used human annotators and trained a reward model to evaluate each roleplaying aspect on a five-point scale. RoleLLM evaluates a model’s ability to emulate a persona using both carefully crafted similarity scores (how similar the generated outputs are to the expected outputs) and AI judges.</p>&#13;
<p>If AI in your application is supposed to assume a certain role, make sure to evaluate whether your model stays in character. Depending on the role, you might be able to create heuristics to evaluate the model’s outputs. For example, if the role is someone who doesn’t talk a lot, a heuristic would be the average of the model’s outputs. Other than that, the easiest automatic evaluation approach is AI as a judge. You should evaluate the roleplaying AI on both style and knowledge. For example, if a model is supposed to talk like Jackie Chan, its outputs should capture Jackie Chan’s style and are generated based on Jackie Chan’s knowledge.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1026" id="id1026-marker">8</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p>AI judges for different roles will need different prompts.

          <h2>Cost and Latency</h2>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="systems evaluation" data-secondary="evaluation criteria" data-tertiary="cost and latency" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html18"/>A model that generates high-quality outputs but is too slow and expensive to run will not be useful. When evaluating models, it’s important to balance model quality, latency, and cost. Many companies opt for lower-quality models if they provide better cost and latency. Cost and latency optimization are discussed in detail in <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#ch09_inference_optimization_1730130963006301">Chapter 9</a>, so this section will be quick.</p>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Pareto optimization" data-type="indexterm" id="id1030"/>Optimizing for multiple objectives is an active field of study called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization">Pareto optimization</a>. When optimizing for multiple objectives, it’s important to be clear about what objectives you can and can’t compromise on. For example, if latency is something you can’t compromise on, you start with latency expectations for different models, filter out all the models that don’t meet your latency requirements, and then pick the best among the rest.</p>&#13;
<p>There are multiple metrics for latency for foundation models, including but not limited to time to first token, time per token, time between tokens, time per query, etc. It’s important to understand what latency metrics matter to you.</p>&#13;
<p>Latency depends not only on the underlying model but also on each prompt and sampling variables. Autoregressive language models typically generate outputs token by token. The more tokens it has to generate, the higher the total latency. You can control the total latency observed by users by careful prompting, such as instructing the model to be concise, setting a stopping condition for generation (discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_understanding_foundation_models_1730147895571359">Chapter 2</a>), or other optimization techniques (discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#ch09_inference_optimization_1730130963006301">Chapter 9</a>).</p>&#13;
          <div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>&#13;
<p>When evaluating models based on latency, it’s important to differentiate between the must-have and the nice-to-have. If you ask users if they want lower latency, nobody will ever say no. But high latency is often an annoyance, not a deal breaker.</p>&#13;
          </div> &#13;
<p>If you use model APIs, they typically charge by tokens. The more input and output tokens you use, the more expensive it is. Many applications then try to reduce the input and output token count to manage cost.</p>&#13;
<p>If you host your own models, your cost, outside engineering cost, is compute. To make the most out of the machines they have, many people choose the largest models that can fit their machines. For example, GPUs usually come with 16 GB, 24 GB, 48 GB, and 80 GB of memory. Therefore, many popular models are those that max out these memory configurations. It’s not a coincidence that many models today have 7 billion or 65 billion parameters.</p>&#13;
<p>If you use model APIs, your cost per token usually doesn’t change much as you scale. However, if you host your own models, your cost per token can get much cheaper as you scale. If you’ve already invested in a cluster that can serve a maximum of 1 billion tokens a day, the compute cost remains the same whether you serve 1 million tokens or 1 billion tokens a day.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1031" id="id1031-marker">9</a></sup> Therefore, at different scales, companies need to reevaluate whether it makes more sense to use model APIs or to host their own models.</p>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_table_3_1730130866138362">Table 4-3</a> shows criteria you might use to evaluate models for your application. The row <em>scale</em> is especially important when evaluating model APIs, because you need a model API service that can support your scale.</p>&#13;

        <h1>Model Selection</h1>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="model selection" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html19"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="systems evaluation" data-secondary="model selection" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html20"/>At the end of the day, you don’t really care about which model is the best. You care about which model is the best <em>for your applications</em>. Once you’ve defined the criteria for your application, you should evaluate models against these criteria.</p>&#13;
<p>During the application development process, as you progress through different adaptation techniques, you’ll have to do model selection over and over again. For example, prompt engineering might start with the strongest model overall to evaluate feasibility and then work backward to see if smaller models would work. If you decide to do finetuning, you might start with a small model to test your code and move toward the biggest model that fits your hardware constraints (e.g., one GPU). </p>&#13;
<p>In general, the selection process for each technique typically involves two steps:</p>&#13;
        <ol>&#13;
<li><p>Figuring out the best achievable performance</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Mapping models along the cost–performance axes and choosing the model that gives the best performance for your bucks</p></li>&#13;
        </ol>&#13;
<p>However, the actual selection process is a lot more nuanced. Let’s explore what it looks like.</p>&#13;
        <section data-pdf-bookmark="Model Selection Workflow" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_model_selection_workflow_1730130866189327">&#13;
          <h2>Model Selection Workflow</h2>&#13;

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hard attributes" data-type="indexterm" id="id1034"/>Hard attributes are often the results of decisions made by model providers (licenses, training data, model size) or your own policies (privacy, control). For some use cases, the hard attributes can reduce the pool of potential models significantly.</p>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="soft attributes" data-type="indexterm" id="id1035"/>Soft attributes are attributes that can be improved upon, such as accuracy, toxicity, or factual consistency. When estimating how much you can improve on a certain attribute, it can be tricky to balance being optimistic and being realistic. I’ve had situations where a model’s accuracy hovered around 20% for the first few prompts. However, the accuracy jumped to 70% after I decomposed the task into two steps. At the same time, I’ve had situations where a model remained unusable for my task even after weeks of tweaking, and I had to give up on that model.</p>&#13;
<p>What you define as hard and soft attributes depends on both the model and your use case. For example, latency is a soft attribute if you have access to the model to optimize it to run faster. It’s a hard attribute if you use a model hosted by someone else.</p>&#13;
<p>At a high level, the evaluation workflow consists of four steps (see <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_5_1730130866113641">Figure 4-5</a>):</p>&#13;
          <ol>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Filter out models whose hard attributes don’t work for you. Your list of hard attributes depends heavily on your own internal policies, whether you want to use commercial APIs or host your own models.</p></li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Use publicly available information, e.g., benchmark performance and leaderboard ranking, to narrow down the most promising models to experiment with, balancing different objectives such as model quality, latency, and cost.</p></li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Run experiments with your own evaluation pipeline to find the best model, again, balancing all your objectives.</p></li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Continually monitor your model in production to detect failure and collect feedback to improve your application.</p></li>&#13;

<p class="pagebreak-before">These four steps are iterative—you might want to change the decision from a previous step with newer information from the current step. For example, you might initially want to host open source models. However, after public and private evaluation, you might realize that open source models can’t achieve the level of performance you want and have to switch to commercial APIs.</p>&#13;

We’ll then continue to how to navigate the dizzying number of public benchmarks and why you can’t trust them. This will set the stage for the last section in the chapter. Because public benchmarks can’t be trusted, you need to design your own evaluation pipeline with prompts and metrics you can trust.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html22" data-type="indexterm" id="id1036"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html21" data-type="indexterm" id="id1037"/></p>&#13;

Since most companies won’t be building foundation models from scratch, the question is whether to use commercial model APIs or host an open source model yourself. The answer to this question can significantly reduce your candidate model pool.</p>&#13;
<p>Let’s first go into what exactly open source means when it comes to models, then discuss the pros and cons of these two approaches.</p>&#13;
          <section data-pdf-bookmark="Open source, open weight, and model licenses" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch04_open_source_open_weight_and_model_licenses_1730130866189479">&#13;
            <h3>Open source, open weight, and model licenses</h3>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="model selection" data-secondary="model build versus buy" data-tertiary="open source, open weight, and model licenses" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html25"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="open source licenses" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html26"/>The term “open source model” has become contentious. Originally, open source was used to refer to any model that people can download and use. For many use cases, being able to download the model is sufficient. However, some people argue that since a model’s performance is largely a function of what data it was trained on, <span class="keep-together"><em>a model</em></span> <em>should be considered open only if its training data is also made publicly</em> <span class="keep-together"><em>available</em>.</span></p>&#13;
<p>Open data allows more flexible model usage, such as retraining the model from scratch with modifications in the model architecture, training process, or the training data itself. Open data also makes it easier to understand the model. Some use cases also required access to the training data for auditing purposes, for example, to make sure that the model wasn’t trained on compromised or illegally acquired data.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1038" id="id1038-marker">10</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="open weight models" data-type="indexterm" id="id1039"/>To signal whether the data is also open, the term “open weight” is used for models that don’t come with open data, whereas the term “open model” is used for models that come with open data.</p>&#13;
            <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>Some people argue that the term open source should be reserved only for fully open models. In this book, for simplicity, I use open source to refer to all models whose weights are made public, regardless of their training data’s availability and licenses.</p>&#13;
            </div>&#13;
<p>As of this writing, the vast majority of open source models are open weight only. Model developers might hide training data information on purpose, as this information can open model developers to public scrutiny and potential lawsuits.</p>&#13;
<p>Another important attribute of open source models is their licenses. Before foundation models, the open source world was confusing enough, with so many different licenses, such as MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Apache 2.0, GNU General Public License (GPL), BSD (Berkely Software Distribution), Creative <span class="keep-together">Commons,</span> etc. Open source models made the licensing situation worse. Many <span class="keep-together">models</span> are released under their own unique licenses. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Llama" data-secondary="open source models" data-type="indexterm" id="id1040"/>For example, Meta released Llama 2 under the <a href="https://oreil.ly/wRlEh">Llama 2 Community License Agreement</a> and Llama 3 under the <a href="https://oreil.ly/FL-1Z">Llama 3 Community License Agreement</a>. Hugging Face released their model BigCode under the <a href="https://oreil.ly/yED-R">BigCode Open RAIL-M v1</a> license. However, I hope that, over time, the community will converge toward some standard licenses. Both <a href="https://github.com/google-deepmind/gemma/blob/main/LICENSE">Google’s Gemma</a> and <a href="https://oreil.ly/uTBwP">Mistral-7B</a> were released under Apache 2.0.</p>&#13;
<p>Each license has its own conditions, so it’ll be up to you to evaluate each license for your needs. However, here are a few questions that I think everyone should ask:</p>&#13;
            <ul>&#13;
<li><p>Does the license allow commercial use? When Meta’s first Llama model was released, it was under a <a href="https://oreil.ly/V1P8X">noncommercial license</a>. </p></li>&#13;

The interface users interact with is called the <em>model API</em>, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_6_1730130866113662">Figure 4-6</a>. The term <em>model API</em> is typically used to refer to the API of the inference service, but there are also APIs for other model services, such as finetuning APIs and evaluation APIs. <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#ch09_inference_optimization_1730130963006301">Chapter 9</a> discusses how to optimize inference services.</p>&#13;

            </div></figure>&#13;
<p>After developing a model, a developer can choose to open source it, make it accessible via an API, or both. Many model developers are also model service providers. Cohere and Mistral open source some models and provide APIs for some. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenAI" data-secondary="open source APIs" data-type="indexterm" id="id1048"/>OpenAI is typically known for their commercial models, but they’ve also open sourced models (GPT-2, CLIP). Typically, model providers open source weaker models and keep their best models behind paywalls, either via APIs or to power their products.</p>&#13;
<p>Model APIs can be available through model providers (such as OpenAI and Anthropic), cloud service providers (such as Azure and GCP [Google Cloud Platform]), or third-party API providers (such as Databricks Mosaic, Anyscale, etc.). The same model can be available through different APIs with different features, constraints, and pricings. For example, GPT-4 is available through both OpenAI and Azure APIs. There might be slight differences in the performance of the same model provided through different APIs, as different APIs might use different techniques to optimize this model, so make sure to run thorough tests when you switch between model APIs.</p>&#13;
<p>Commercial models are only accessible via APIs licensed by the model developers.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1049" id="id1049-marker">13</a></sup> Open source models can be supported by any API provider, allowing you to pick and choose the provider that works best for you. For commercial model providers, <em>models are their competitive advantages</em>. For API providers that don’t have their own models, <em>APIs are their competitive advantages</em>. This means API providers might be more motivated to provide better APIs with better pricing.</p>&#13;
<p>Since building scalable inference services for larger models is nontrivial, many companies don’t want to build them themselves. This has led to the creation of many third-party inference and finetuning services on top of open source models. Major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP all provide API access to popular open source models. A plethora of startups are doing the same.</p>&#13;
            <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>There are also commercial API providers that can deploy their services within your private networks. In this discussion, I treat these privately deployed commercial APIs similarly to self-hosted models.</p>&#13;
            </div>&#13;
<p>The answer to whether to host a model yourself or use a model API depends on the use case. And the same use case can change over time. Here are seven axes to consider: data privacy, data lineage, performance, functionality, costs, control, and on-device deployment. </p>&#13;
            <section data-pdf-bookmark="Data privacy" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="ch04_data_privacy_1730130866189626">&#13;

However, the incident was serious enough for <a href="https://oreil.ly/fWs9H">Samsung to ban ChatGPT</a> in May 2023.</p>&#13;
<p>Some countries have laws that forbid sending certain data outside their borders. If a model API provider wants to serve these use cases, they will have to set up servers in these countries.</p>&#13;
<p>If you use a model API, there’s a risk that the API provider will use your data to train its models. Even though most model API providers claim they don’t do that, their policies can change. In August 2023, <a href="https://oreil.ly/xndQu"> Zoom faced a backlash</a> after people found out the company had quietly changed its terms of service to let Zoom use users’ service-generated data, including product usage data and diagnostics data, to train its AI models.</p>&#13;
<p>What’s the problem with people using your data to train their models? While research in this area is still sparse, some studies suggest that AI models can <span class="keep-together">memorize their</span> training samples. For example, it’s been found that <a href="https://x.com/dhuynh95/status/1713917852162424915">Hugging Face’s StarCoder model</a> memorizes 8% of its training set. These memorized samples can be accidentally leaked to users or intentionally exploited by bad actors, as demonstrated in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch05a_prompt_engineering_1730156991195551">Chapter 5</a>.</p>&#13;

            <section data-pdf-bookmark="Data lineage and copyright" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="ch04_data_lineage_and_copyright_1730130866189685">&#13;
              <h4>Data lineage and copyright</h4>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data lineage" data-type="indexterm" id="id1055"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="open source models, model APIs versus" data-secondary="data lineage and copyright" data-type="indexterm" id="id1056"/>Data lineage and copyright concerns can steer a company in many directions: toward open source models, toward proprietary models, or away from both.</p>&#13;
<p>For most models, there’s little transparency about what data a model is trained on. In <a href="https://oreil.ly/AhHI_">Gemini’s technical report</a>, Google went into detail about the models’ performance but said nothing about the models’ training data other than that “all data enrichment workers are paid at least a local living wage”. <a href="https://x.com/JoannaStern/status/1768306032466428291">OpenAI’s CTO</a> wasn’t able to provide a satisfactory answer when asked what data was used to train their models.</p>&#13;
<p>On top of that, the IP laws around AI are actively evolving. While the <a href="https://oreil.ly/p23MQ">US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)</a> made clear in 2024 that “AI-assisted inventions are not categorically unpatentable”, an AI application’s patentability depends on “whether the human contribution to an innovation is significant enough to qualify for a patent.” <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="copyright, model training and" data-type="indexterm" id="id1057"/>It’s also unclear whether, if a model was trained on copyrighted data, and you use this model to create your product, you can defend your product’s IP. Many companies whose existence depends upon their IPs, such as gaming and movie studios, are <a href="https://oreil.ly/-qEXt">hesitant to use AI</a> to aid in the creation of their products, at least until IP laws around AI are clarified (James Vincent, <em>The Verge, </em>November 15, 2022).</p>&#13;
<p>Concerns over data lineage have driven some companies toward fully open models, whose training data has been made publicly available. The argument is that this allows the community to inspect the data and make sure that it’s safe to use. While it sounds great in theory, in practice, it’s challenging for any company to thoroughly inspect a dataset of the size typically used to train foundation models.</p>&#13;
<p>Given the same concern, many companies opt for commercial models instead. Open source models tend to have limited legal resources compared to commercial models. If you use an open source model that infringes on copyrights, the infringed party is unlikely to go after the model developers, and more likely to go after you. However, if you use a commercial model, the contracts you sign with the model providers can potentially protect you from data lineage risks.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1058" id="id1058-marker">16</a></sup></p>&#13;

              <h4>Performance</h4>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="open source models, model APIs versus" data-secondary="performance" data-type="indexterm" id="id1059"/>Various benchmarks have shown that the gap between open source models and proprietary models is closing. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_7_1730130866113682">Figure 4-7</a> shows this gap decreasing on the MMLU benchmark over time. This trend has made many people believe that one day, there will be an open source model that performs just as well, if not better, than the strongest proprietary model.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As much as I want open source models to catch up with proprietary models, I don’t think the incentives are set up for it. If you have the strongest model available, would you rather open source it for other people to capitalize on it, or would you try to capitalize on it yourself?<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1060" id="id1060-marker">17</a></sup> It’s a common practice for companies to keep their strongest models behind APIs and open source their weaker models.</p>&#13;

              </div></figure>&#13;
<p>For this reason, it’s likely that the strongest open source model will lag behind the strongest proprietary models for the foreseeable future. However, for many use cases that don’t need the strongest models, open source models might be sufficient.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Another reason that might cause open source models to lag behind is that open source developers don’t receive feedback from users to improve their models, the way commercial models do. Once a model is open sourced, model developers have no idea how the model is being used, and how well the model works in the wild.</p>&#13;

            <section data-pdf-bookmark="Functionality" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="ch04_functionality_1730130866189798">&#13;
              <h4>Functionality</h4>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="open source models, model APIs versus" data-secondary="functionality" data-type="indexterm" id="id1061"/>Many functionalities are needed around a model to make it work for a use case. Here are some examples of these functionalities:</p>&#13;
              <ul>&#13;
<li><p>Scalability: making sure the inference service can support your application’s traffic while maintaining the desirable latency and cost.</p>&#13;
                </li>&#13;
<li><p>Function calling: giving the model the ability to use external tools, which is essential for RAG and agentic use cases, as discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06_rag_and_agents_1730157386571386">Chapter 6</a>. </p>&#13;
                </li>&#13;
<li><p>Structured outputs, such as asking models to generate outputs in JSON format.</p>&#13;
                </li>&#13;
<li><p>Output guardrails: mitigating risks in the generated responses, such as making sure the responses aren’t racist or sexist.</p>&#13;
                </li>&#13;
              </ul>&#13;
<p>Many of these functionalities are challenging and time-consuming to implement, which makes many companies turn to API providers that provide the functionalities they want out of the box.</p>&#13;
<p>The downside of using a model API is that you’re restricted to the functionalities that the API provides. A functionality that many use cases need is logprobs, which are very useful for classification tasks, evaluation, and interpretability. However, commercial model providers might be hesitant to expose logprobs for fear of others using logprobs to replicate their models. In fact, many model APIs don’t expose logprobs or expose only limited logprobs.</p>&#13;
<p>You can also only finetune a commercial model if the model provider lets you. Imagine that you’ve maxed out a model’s performance with prompting and want to finetune that model. If this model is proprietary and the model provider doesn’t have a finetuning API, you won’t be able to do it. However, if it’s an open source model, you can find a service that offers finetuning on that model, or you can finetune it yourself. Keep in mind that there are multiple types of finetuning, such as partial finetuning and full finetuning, as discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>. A commercial model provider might support only some types of finetuning, not all.</p>&#13;
            </div></section>&#13;
            <section data-pdf-bookmark="API cost versus engineering cost" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="ch04_api_cost_versus_engineering_cost_1730130866189856">&#13;
              <h4>API cost versus engineering cost</h4>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="open source models, model APIs versus" data-secondary="API cost versus engineering cost" data-type="indexterm" id="id1062"/>Model APIs charge per usage, which means that they can get prohibitively expensive with heavy usage. At a certain scale, a company that is bleeding its resources using APIs might consider hosting their own models.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1063" id="id1063-marker">18</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p>However, hosting a model yourself requires nontrivial time, talent, and engineering effort. You’ll need to optimize the model, scale and maintain the inference service as needed, and provide guardrails around your model. APIs are expensive, but engineering can be even more so.</p>&#13;
<p>On the other hand, using another API means that you’ll have to depend on their SLA, service-level agreement. If these APIs aren’t reliable, which is often the case with early startups, you’ll have to spend your engineering effort on guardrails around that.</p>&#13;
<p>In general, you want a model that is easy to use and manipulate. Typically, proprietary models are easier to get started with and scale, but open models might be easier to manipulate as their components are more accessible.</p>&#13;
<p>Regardless of whether you go with open or proprietary models, you want this model to follow a standard API, which makes it easier to swap models. Many model developers try to make their models mimic the API of the most popular models. As of this writing, many API providers mimic OpenAI’s API.</p>&#13;
<p>You might also prefer models with good community support. The more capabilities a model has, the more quirks it has. A model with a large community of users means that any issue you encounter may already have been experienced by others, who might have shared solutions online.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1064" id="id1064-marker">19</a></sup></p>&#13;

              </div></figure>&#13;
<p>If your business depends on a model, it’s understandable that you would want some control over it, and API providers might not always give you the level of control you want. When using a service provided by someone else, you’re subject to their terms and conditions, and their rate limits. You can access only what’s made available to you by this provider, and thus might not be able to tweak the model as needed.</p>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="guardrails" data-type="indexterm" id="id1066"/>To protect their users and themselves from potential lawsuits, model providers use safety guardrails such as blocking requests to tell racist jokes or generate photos of real people. Proprietary models are more likely to err on the side of over-censoring. These safety guardrails are good for the vast majority of use cases but can be a limiting factor for certain use cases. For example, if your application requires generating real faces (e.g., to aid in the production of a music video) a model that refuses to generate real faces won’t work. A company I advise, <a href="https://convai.com">Convai</a>, builds 3D AI characters that can interact in 3D environments, including picking up objects. When working with commercial models, they ran into an issue where the models kept responding: <em>“As an AI model, I don’t have physical abilities”</em>. Convai ended up finetuning open source models.</p>&#13;
<p>There’s also the risk of losing access to a commercial model, which can be painful if you’ve built your system around it. You can’t freeze a commercial model the way you can with open source models. Historically, commercial models lack transparency in model changes, versions, and roadmaps. Models are frequently updated, but not all changes are announced in advance or even announced at all. Your prompts might stop working as expected and you have no idea. Unpredictable changes also make commercial models unusable for strictly regulated applications. However, I suspect that this historical lack of transparency in model changes might just be an unintentional side effect of a fast-growing industry. I hope that this will change as the industry matures.</p>&#13;
<p>A less common situation that unfortunately exists is that a model provider can stop supporting your use case, your industry, or your country, or your country can ban your model provider, as <a href="https://oreil.ly/pY1FF">Italy briefly banned OpenAI in 2023</a>. A model provider can also go out of business altogether.</p>&#13;

<p>The pros and cons of each approach hopefully can help you decide whether to use a commercial API or to host a model yourself. This decision should significantly narrow your options.

The number of benchmarks rapidly grows to match the rapidly growing number of AI use cases. In addition, as AI models improve, old benchmarks saturate, necessitating the introduction of new benchmarks.</p>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="evaluation harnesses" data-type="indexterm" id="id1073"/>A tool that helps you evaluate a model on multiple benchmarks is an <em>evaluation harness</em>. As of this writing, <a href="https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/master/docs/task_table.md">EleutherAI’s lm-evaluation-harness</a> supports over 400 benchmarks. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenAI" data-secondary="evaluation harnesses" data-type="indexterm" id="id1074"/><a href="https://github.com/openai/evals">OpenAI’s evals</a> lets you run any of the approximately 500 existing benchmarks and register new benchmarks to evaluate OpenAI models.

            <h3>Benchmark selection and aggregation</h3>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="model selection" data-secondary="navigating public benchmarks" data-tertiary="benchmark selection and aggregation" data-type="indexterm" id="id1075"/>Benchmark results help you identify promising models for your use cases. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="leaderboards" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html32a"/>Aggregating benchmark results to rank models gives you a leaderboard. There are two questions to consider: </p>&#13;
            <ul>&#13;
<li><p>What benchmarks to include in your leaderboard?</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>How to aggregate these benchmark results to rank models?</p></li>&#13;
            </ul>&#13;
<p>Given so many benchmarks out there, it’s impossible to look at them all, let alone aggregate their results to decide which model is the best. Imagine that you’re considering two models, A and B, for code generation. If model A performs better than model B on a coding benchmark but worse on a toxicity benchmark, which model would you choose? Similarly, which model would you choose if one model performs better in one coding benchmark but worse in another coding benchmark?</p>&#13;
<p>For inspiration on how to create your own leaderboard from public benchmarks, it’s useful to look into how public leaderboards do so.</p>&#13;
            <section data-pdf-bookmark="Public leaderboards" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="ch04_public_leaderboards_1730130866190233">&#13;
              <h4>Public leaderboards</h4>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="model selection" data-secondary="navigating public benchmarks" data-tertiary="public leaderboards" data-type="indexterm" id="id1076"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="public leaderboards" data-type="indexterm" id="id1077"/>Many public leaderboards rank models based on their aggregated performance on a subset of benchmarks. These leaderboards are immensely helpful but far from being comprehensive. First, due to the compute constraint—evaluating a model on a benchmark requires compute—most leaderboards can incorporate only a small number of benchmarks. Some leaderboards might exclude an important but expensive benchmark. For example, HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models) Lite left out an information retrieval benchmark (MS MARCO, Microsoft Machine Reading Comprehension) because it’s <a href="https://oreil.ly/7PFUy">expensive to run</a>. Hugging Face opted out of HumanEval due to its <a href="https://oreil.ly/pgGZ0">large compute requirements</a>—you need to generate a lot of completions.</p>&#13;
<p>When <a href="https://oreil.ly/-uhru">Hugging Face first launched Open LLM Leaderboard in 2023</a>, it consisted of four benchmarks. By the end of that year, they extended it to six benchmarks. A small set of benchmarks is not nearly enough to represent the vast capabilities and different failure modes of foundation models.</p>&#13;
<p>Additionally, while leaderboard developers are generally thoughtful about how they select benchmarks, their decision-making process isn’t always clear to users. Different leaderboards often end up with different benchmarks, making it hard to compare and interpret their rankings. For example, in late 2023, Hugging Face updated their Open LLM Leaderboard to use the average of six different benchmarks to rank models:</p>&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
<p>At around the same time, <a href="https://oreil.ly/CQ52G">Stanford’s HELM Leaderboard</a> used ten benchmarks, only two of which (MMLU and GSM-8K) were in the Hugging Face leaderboard. The other eight benchmarks are:</p>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              <ul>&#13;
<li><p>A benchmark for competitive math (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03874">MATH</a>)</p>&#13;
                </li>&#13;
<li><p>One each for legal (<a href="https://oreil.ly/jCo7o">LegalBench</a>), medical (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13081">MedQA</a>), and translation (<a href="https://oreil.ly/bdGKm">WMT 2014</a>)</p>&#13;
                </li>&#13;
<li><p>Two for reading comprehension—answering questions based on a book or a <span class="keep-together">long story</span> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07040">NarrativeQA</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02789">OpenBookQA</a>)</p>&#13;
                </li>&#13;
<li><p>Two for general question answering (<a href="https://oreil.ly/QB4XP">Natural Questions</a> under two settings, with and without Wikipedia pages in the input)</p>&#13;
                </li>&#13;
              </ul>&#13;
<p>Hugging Face explained they chose these benchmarks because “they test a variety of reasoning and general knowledge across a wide variety of fields.”<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1084" id="id1084-marker">20</a></sup> The HELM website explained that their benchmark list was “inspired by the simplicity” of the Hugging Face’s leaderboard but with a broader set of scenarios.</p>&#13;
<p>Public leaderboards, in general, try to balance coverage and the number of benchmarks. They try to pick a small set of benchmarks that cover a wide range of capabilities, typically including reasoning, factual consistency, and domain-specific capabilities such as math and science.</p>&#13;
<p>At a high level, this makes sense. However, there’s no clarity on what coverage means or why it stops at six or ten benchmarks. For example, why are medical and legal tasks included in HELM Lite but not general science? Why does HELM Lite have two math tests but no coding? Why does neither have tests for summarization, tool use, toxicity detection, image search, etc.? These questions aren’t meant to criticize these public leaderboards but to highlight the challenge of selecting benchmarks to rank models. If leaderboard developers can’t explain their benchmark selection processes, it might be because it’s really hard to do so.</p>&#13;
     &#13;
&#13;
     <p>An important aspect of benchmark selection that is often overlooked is benchmark correlation. It is important because if two benchmarks are perfectly correlated, you don’t want both of them. Strongly correlated benchmarks can exaggerate biases.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1085" id="id1085-marker">21</a></sup></p>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>While I was writing this book, many benchmarks became saturated or close to being saturated. In June 2024, less than a <span class="keep-together">year after</span> <span class="keep-together">their leaderboard’s</span> last revamp, Hugging Face updated their <span class="keep-together">leaderboard</span> again with an entirely new set of benchmarks that <span class="keep-together">are more</span> challenging and focus on more practical capabilities. <span class="keep-together">For example,</span> <a href="https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1803812369237528825">GSM-8K was replaced by MATH lvl 5</a>, which consists of the most challenging questions from the competitive math benchmark <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03874">MATH</a>. MMLU was replaced <span class="keep-together">by MMLU-PRO</span> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01574">Wang et al., 2024</a>). They also included the following benchmarks:</p>&#13;
  <ul>&#13;

<li><p>MuSR (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16049">Sprague et al., 2023</a>): a chain-of-thought, multistep reasoning <span class="keep-together">benchmark</span></p></li>&#13;
<li><p>BBH (BIG-bench Hard) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615">Srivastava et al., 2023</a>): another reasoning benchmark</p></li>&#13;

    </ul>&#13;
<p>I have no doubt that these benchmarks will soon become saturated. However, discussing specific benchmarks, even if outdated, can still be useful as examples to evaluate and interpret benchmarks.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1087" id="id1087-marker">23</a></sup></p>&#13;

<p>The results from all the selected benchmarks need to be aggregated to rank models. As of this writing, Hugging Face averages a model’s scores on all these benchmarks to get the final score to rank that model. Averaging means treating all benchmark scores equally, i.e., treating an 80% score on TruthfulQA the same as an 80% score on GSM-8K, even if an 80% score on TruthfulQA might be much harder to achieve than an 80% score on GSM-8K. This also means giving all benchmarks the same weight, even if, for some tasks, truthfulness might weigh a lot more than being able to solve grade school math problems.</p>&#13;
<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/MLlDD">HELM authors</a>, on the other hand, decided to shun averaging in favor of mean win rate, which they defined as “the fraction of times a model obtains a better score than another model, averaged across scenarios”.</p>&#13;
<p>While public leaderboards are useful to get a sense of models’ broad performance, it’s important to understand what capabilities a leaderboard is trying to capture. A model that ranks high on a public leaderboard will likely, but far from always, perform well for your application. If you want a model for code generation, a public leaderboard that doesn’t include a code generation benchmark might not help you as much.</p>&#13;

              <h4>Custom leaderboards with public benchmarks</h4>&#13;
<p>When evaluating models for a specific application, you’re basically creating a private leaderboard that ranks models based on your evaluation criteria. The first step is to gather a list of benchmarks that <span class="keep-together">evaluate</span> the capabilities important to your application. If you want to build a coding agent, look at code-related benchmarks. If you build a writing assistant, look into creative writing benchmarks. As new benchmarks are constantly introduced and old <span class="keep-together">benchmarks</span> become saturated, you should look for the latest benchmarks. Make sure to evaluate how reliable a benchmark is. Because anyone can create and publish a benchmark, many benchmarks might not be measuring what you expect them to measure.</p>&#13;

For example, a study by Stanford and UC Berkeley (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09009">Chen et al., 2023</a>) found that for many benchmarks, both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4’s performances changed significantly between March 2023 and June 2023, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_9_1730130866113721">Figure 4-9</a>.</p>&#13;

             &#13;
<p>Assuming that OpenAI doesn’t intentionally release worse models, what might be the reason for this perception? One potential reason is that evaluation is hard, and no one, not even OpenAI, knows for sure if a model is getting better or worse. While evaluation is definitely hard, I doubt that OpenAI would fly completely blind.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1090" id="id1090-marker">24</a></sup> If the second reason is true, it reinforces the idea that the best model overall might not be the best model for your <span class="keep-together">application.</span></p>&#13;
              </div></aside>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Not all models have publicly available scores on all benchmarks. If the model you care about doesn’t have a publicly available score on your benchmark, you will need to run the evaluation yourself.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1091" id="id1091-marker">25</a></sup> Hopefully, an evaluation harness can help you with that. Running benchmarks can be expensive. For example, Stanford spent approximately $80,000–$100,000 to evaluate 30 models on their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09110">full HELM suite</a>.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1092" id="id1092-marker">26</a></sup> The more models you want to evaluate and the more benchmarks you want to use, the more expensive it gets.</p>&#13;
<p>Once you’ve selected a set of benchmarks and obtained the scores for the models you care about on these benchmarks, you then need to aggregate these scores to rank models. Not all benchmark scores are in the same unit or scale. One benchmark might use accuracy, another F1, and another BLEU score. You will need to think about how important each benchmark is to you and weigh their scores accordingly.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html32a" data-type="indexterm" id="id1093"/></p>&#13;
<p>As you evaluate models using public benchmarks, keep in mind that the goal of this process is to select a small subset of models to do more rigorous experiments using your own benchmarks and metrics. This is not only because public benchmarks are unlikely to represent your application’s needs perfectly, but also because they are likely contaminated. How public benchmarks get contaminated and how to handle data contamination will be the topic of the next section.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html32" data-type="indexterm" id="id1094"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html31a" data-type="indexterm" id="id1095"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html31" data-type="indexterm" id="id1096"/></p>&#13;

            <h3>Data contamination with public benchmarks</h3>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data contamination" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html33"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="systems evaluation" data-secondary="model selection" data-tertiary="data contamination with public benchmarks" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html34"/>Data contamination is so common that there are many different names for it, including <em>data leakage</em>, <em>training on the test set</em>, or simply <em>cheating</em>. <em>Data contamination</em> happens when a model was trained on the same data it’s evaluated on. If so, it’s possible that the model just memorizes the answers it saw during training, causing it to achieve higher evaluation scores than it should. A model that is trained on the MMLU benchmark can achieve high MMLU scores without being useful.</p>&#13;
<p>Rylan Schaeffer, a PhD student at Stanford, demonstrated this beautifully in his 2023 satirical paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08632">“Pretraining on the Test Set Is All You Need”</a>. By training exclusively on data from several benchmarks, his one-million-parameter model was able to achieve near-perfect scores and outperformed much larger models on all these benchmarks.</p>&#13;
            <section class="pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="How data contamination happens" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="ch04_how_data_contamination_happens_1730130866190612">&#13;
              <h4 class="less_space">How data contamination happens</h4>&#13;
<p>While some might intentionally train on benchmark data to achieve misleadingly high scores, most data contamination is unintentional. Many models today are trained on data scraped from the internet, and the scraping process can accidentally pull data from publicly available benchmarks. Benchmark data published before the training of a model is likely included in the model’s training data.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch04.html#id1097" id="id1097-marker">27</a></sup> It’s one of the reasons existing benchmarks become saturated so quickly, and why model developers often feel the need to create new benchmarks to evaluate their new models.</p>&#13;
<p>Data contamination can happen indirectly, such as when both evaluation and training data come from the same source. For example, you might include math textbooks in the training data to improve the model’s math capabilities, and someone else might use questions from the same math textbooks to create a benchmark to evaluate the model’s capabilities.</p>&#13;
<p>Data contamination can also happen intentionally for good reasons. Let’s say you want to create the best possible model for your users. Initially, you exclude benchmark data from the model’s training data and choose the best model based on these benchmarks. However, because high-quality benchmark data can improve the model’s performance, you then continue training your best model on benchmark data before releasing it to your users. So the released model is contaminated, and your users won’t be able to evaluate it on contaminated benchmarks, but this might still be the right thing to do.</p>&#13;
            </div></section>&#13;
            <section data-pdf-bookmark="Handling data contamination" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="ch04_handling_data_contamination_1730130866190669">&#13;
              <h4>Handling data contamination</h4>&#13;
<p>The prevalence of data contamination undermines the trustworthiness of evaluation benchmarks. Just because a model can achieve high performance on bar exams doesn’t mean it’s good at giving legal advice. It could just be that this model has been trained on many bar exam questions.</p>&#13;
<p>To deal with data contamination, you first need to detect the contamination, and then decontaminate your data. You can detect contamination using heuristics like n-gram overlapping and perplexity:</p>&#13;
              <dl>&#13;
                <dt>N-gram overlapping</dt>&#13;
                <dd>&#13;
<p>For example, if a sequence of 13 tokens in an evaluation sample is also in the training data, the model has likely seen this evaluation sample during training. This evaluation sample is considered <em>dirty</em>.</p>&#13;
                </dd>&#13;
              </dl>&#13;
              <dl>&#13;
                <dt>Perplexity</dt>&#13;
                <dd>&#13;
<p>Recall that perplexity measures how difficult it is for a model to predict a given text. If a model’s perplexity on evaluation data is unusually low, meaning the model can easily predict the text, it’s possible that the model has seen this data before during training.</p>&#13;
                </dd>&#13;
              </dl>&#13;
<p>The n-gram overlapping approach is more accurate but can be time-consuming and expensive to run because you have to compare each benchmark example with the entire training data. It’s also impossible without access to the training data. The perplexity approach is less accurate but much less resource-intensive.</p>&#13;
<p>In the past, ML textbooks advised removing evaluation samples from the training data. The goal is to keep evaluation benchmarks standardized so that we can compare different models. However, with foundation models, most people don’t have control over training data. Even if we have control over training data, we might not want to remove all benchmark data from the training data, because high-quality benchmark data can help improve the overall model performance. Besides, there will always be benchmarks created after models are trained, so there will always be contaminated evaluation samples.</p>&#13;
<p>For model developers, a common practice is to remove benchmarks they care about from their training data before training their models. Ideally, when reporting your model performance on a benchmark, it’s helpful to disclose what percentage of this benchmark data is in your training data, and what the model’s performance is on both the overall benchmark and the clean samples of the benchmark. Sadly, because detecting and removing contamination takes effort, many people find it easier to just skip it.</p>&#13;
<p>OpenAI, when analyzing GPT-3’s contamination with common benchmarks, found 13 benchmarks with at least 40% in the training data (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">Brown et al., 2020</a>). The relative difference in performance between evaluating only the clean sample and evaluating the whole benchmark is shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_figure_10_1730130866113746">Figure 4-10</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="pagebreak-before">To combat data contamination, leaderboard hosts like Hugging Face plot standard deviations of models’ performance on a given benchmark <a href="https://oreil.ly/LghFT">to spot outliers</a>. Public benchmarks should keep part of their data private and provide a tool for model developers to automatically evaluate models against the private hold-out data.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>Public benchmarks will help you filter out bad models, but they won’t help you find the best models for your application. After using public benchmarks to narrow them to a set of promising models, you’ll need to run your own evaluation pipeline to find the best one for your application.

        <h1>Design Your Evaluation Pipeline</h1>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="evaluation pipeline design" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html35"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="systems evaluation" data-secondary="evaluation pipeline design" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html36"/>The success of an AI application often hinges on the ability to differentiate good outcomes from bad outcomes. To be able to do this, you need an evaluation pipeline that you can rely upon. With an explosion of evaluation methods and techniques, it can be confusing to pick the right combination for your evaluation pipeline. This section focuses on evaluating open-ended tasks. Evaluating close-ended tasks is easier, and its pipeline can be inferred from this process.</p>&#13;
        <section data-pdf-bookmark="Step 1. Evaluate All Components in a System" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch04_step_1_evaluate_all_components_in_a_system_1730130866190824">&#13;
          <h2>Step 1. Evaluate All Components in a System</h2>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="evaluation pipeline design" data-secondary="step 2: evaluating all components in a system" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html38"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="system components evaluation" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html39"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="systems evaluation" data-secondary="evaluation pipeline design" data-tertiary="step 2: evaluating all components in a system" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html40"/>Real-world AI applications are complex. Each application might consist of many components, and a task might be completed after many turns. Evaluation can happen at different levels: per task, per turn, and per intermediate output.</p>&#13;
<p>You should evaluate the end-to-end output and each component’s intermediate output independently. Consider an application that extracts a person’s current employer from their resume PDF, which works in two steps:</p>&#13;
          <ol>&#13;
<li><p>Extract all the text from the PDF.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Extract the current employer from the extracted text.</p></li>&#13;
          </ol>&#13;
<p>If the model fails to extract the right current employer, it can be because of either step. If you don’t evaluate each component independently, you don’t know exactly where your system fails. The first PDF-to-text step can be evaluated using similarity between the extracted text and the ground truth text. The second step can be evaluated using accuracy: given the correctly extracted text, how often does the application correctly extract the current employer?</p>&#13;
<p>If applicable, evaluate your application both per turn and per task. A turn can consist of multiple steps and messages. If a system takes multiple steps to generate an output, it’s still considered a turn.</p>&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">Generative AI applications, especially chatbot-like applications, allow back-and-forth between the user and the application, as in a conversation, to accomplish a task. Imagine you want to use an AI model to debug why your Python code is failing. The model responds by asking for more information about your hardware or the Python version you’re using. Only after you’ve provided this information can the model help you debug.</p>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="task-based evaluation" data-type="indexterm" id="id1102"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="turn-based evaluation" data-type="indexterm" id="id1103"/><em>Turn-based</em> evaluation evaluates the quality of each output. <em>Task-based</em> evaluation evaluates whether a system completes a task. Did the application help you fix the bug? How many turns did it take to complete the task? It makes a big difference if a system is able to solve a problem in two turns or in twenty turns.</p>&#13;
<p>Given that what users really care about is whether a model can help them accomplish their tasks, task-based evaluation is more important. However, a challenge of task-based evaluation is it can be hard to determine the boundaries between tasks. Imagine a conversation you have with ChatGPT. You might ask multiple questions at the same time. When you send a new query, is this a follow-up to an existing task or a new task?</p>&#13;
<p>One example of task-based evaluation is the <code>twenty_questions</code> benchmark, inspired by the classic game Twenty Questions, in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615">BIG-bench benchmark suite</a>. One instance of the model (Alice) chooses a concept, such as apple, car, or computer. Another instance of the model (Bob) asks Alice a series of questions to try to identify this concept. Alice can only answer yes or no. The score is based on whether Bob successfully guesses the concept, and how many questions it takes for Bob to guess it. Here’s an example of a plausible conversation in this task, taken from the <a href="https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/blob/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/twenty_questions/README.md">BIG-bench’s GitHub repository</a>:<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html40" data-type="indexterm" id="id1104"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html39" data-type="indexterm" id="id1105"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html38" data-type="indexterm" id="id1106"/></p>&#13;
          <pre data-type="programlisting">Bob: Is the concept an animal?&#13;
Alice: No.&#13;
Bob: Is the concept a plant?&#13;
Alice: Yes.&#13;
Bob: Does it grow in the ocean?&#13;
Alice: No.&#13;
Bob: Does it grow in a tree?&#13;
Alice: Yes.&#13;
Bob: Is it an apple?&#13;

An ambiguous guideline leads to ambiguous scores that can be misleading. If you don’t know what bad responses look like, you won’t be able to catch them.</p>&#13;
<p>When creating the evaluation guideline, it’s important to define not only what the application should do, but also what it shouldn’t do. For example, if you build a customer support chatbot, should this chatbot answer questions unrelated to your product, such as about an upcoming election? If not, you need to define what inputs are out of the scope of your application, how to detect them, and how your application should respond to them.</p>&#13;
          <section data-pdf-bookmark="Define evaluation criteria" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch04_define_evaluation_criteria_1730130866190966">&#13;

In retrospect of one year of deploying generative <span class="keep-together">AI applications,</span> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7189260630053261313/">LinkedIn</a> shared that the first hurdle was in creating an evaluation guideline. <em>A correct response is not always a good response.</em> For example, for their AI-powered Job Assessment application, the response “You are a terrible fit” might be correct but not helpful, thus making it a bad response. A good response should explain the gap between this job’s requirements and the candidate’s background, and what the candidate can do to close this gap.</p>&#13;
<p>Before building your application, think about what makes a good response. <a href="https://oreil.ly/d1ey3">LangChain’s <em>State of AI 2023</em></a> found that, on average, their users used 2.3 different types of feedback (criteria) to evaluate an application. For example, for a customer support application, a good response might be defined using three <span class="keep-together">criteria:</span></p>&#13;
            <ol>&#13;
              <li><p>Relevance: the response is relevant to the user’s query.</p></li>&#13;
              <li><p>Factual consistency: the response is factually consistent with the context.</p></li>&#13;
              <li><p>Safety: the response isn’t toxic.</p></li>&#13;
            </ol>&#13;
<p>To come up with these criteria, you might need to play around with test queries, ideally real user queries. For each of these test queries, generate multiple responses, either manually or using AI models, and determine if they are good or bad.</p>&#13;

For example, to evaluate whether an answer is consistent with a given context, some teams use a binary scoring system: 0 for factual inconsistency and 1 for factual consistency. Some teams use three values: -1 for contradiction, 1 for entailment, and 0 for neutral. Which scoring system to use depends on your data and your needs.</p>&#13;
<p>On this scoring system, create a rubric with examples. What does a response with a score of 1 look like and why does it deserve a 1? Validate your rubric with humans: yourself, coworkers, friends, etc. If humans find it hard to follow the rubric, you need to refine it to make it unambiguous. This process can require a lot of back and forth, but it’s necessary. A clear guideline is the backbone of a reliable evaluation pipeline. This guideline can also be reused later for training data annotation, as discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_dataset_engineering_1730130932019888">Chapter 8</a>.</p>&#13;

The application’s metrics must be considered in the context of the business problem it’s built to solve.</p>&#13;
<p>For example, if your customer support chatbot’s factual consistency is 80%, what does it mean for the business? For example, this level of factual consistency might make the chatbot unusable for questions about billing but good enough for queries about product recommendations or general customer feedback. Ideally, you want to map evaluation metrics to business metrics, to something that looks like this:</p>&#13;
            <ul>&#13;
<li><p>Factual consistency of 80%: we can automate 30% of customer support requests.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Factual consistency of 90%: we can automate 50%.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Factual consistency of 98%: we can automate 90%.</p></li>&#13;
            </ul>&#13;
<p>Understanding the impact of evaluation metrics on business metrics is helpful for planning. If you know how much gain you can get from improving a certain metric, you might have more confidence to invest resources into improving that metric.</p>&#13;
<p>It’s also helpful to determine the usefulness threshold: what scores must an application achieve for it to be useful? For example, you might determine that your chatbot’s factual consistency score must be at least 50% for it to be useful. Anything below this makes it unusable even for general customer requests.</p>&#13;
<p>Before developing AI evaluation metrics, it’s crucial to first understand the business metrics you’re targeting. Many applications focus on <em>stickiness</em> metrics, such as daily, weekly, or monthly active users (DAU, WAU, MAU). Others prioritize <em>engagement</em> metrics, like the number of conversations a user initiates per month or the duration of each visit—the longer a user stays on the app, the less likely they are to leave. Choosing which metrics to prioritize can feel like balancing profits with social responsibility.

          <h2>Step 3. Define Evaluation Methods and Data</h2>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="evaluation pipeline design" data-secondary="step 3: defining evaluation methods and data" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html44"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="systems evaluation" data-secondary="evaluation pipeline design" data-tertiary="step 3: defining evaluation methods and data" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html45"/>Now that you’ve developed your criteria and scoring rubrics, let’s define what methods and data you want to use to evaluate your application.</p>&#13;
          <section data-pdf-bookmark="Select evaluation methods" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch04_select_evaluation_methods_1730130866191218">&#13;
            <h3>Select evaluation methods</h3>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="evaluation pipeline design" data-secondary="step 3: defining evaluation methods and data" data-tertiary="selecting evaluation methods" data-type="indexterm" id="id1118"/>Different criteria might require different evaluation methods. For example, you use a small, specialized toxicity classifier for toxicity detection, semantic similarity to measure relevance between the response and the user’s original question, and an AI judge to measure the factual consistency between the response and the whole context. An unambiguous scoring rubric and examples will be critical for specialized scorers and AI judges to succeed.</p>&#13;
<p>It’s possible to mix and match evaluation methods for the same criteria. For example, you might have a cheap classifier that gives low-quality signals on 100% of your data, and an expensive AI judge to give high-quality signals on 1% of the data. This gives you a certain level of confidence in your application while keeping costs manageable.</p>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="logprobs" data-type="indexterm" id="id1119"/>When logprobs are available, use them. Logprobs can be used to measure how confident a model is about a generated token. This is especially useful for classification. For example, if you ask a model to output one of the three classes and the model’s logprobs for these three classes are all between 30 and 40%, this means the model isn’t confident about this prediction. However, if the model’s probability for one class is 95%, this means that the model is highly confident about this prediction. Logprobs can also be used to evaluate a model’s perplexity for a generated text, which can be used for measurements such as fluency and factual consistency.</p>&#13;
<p>Use automatic metrics as much as possible, but don’t be afraid to fall back on human evaluation, even in production. Having human experts manually evaluate a model’s quality is a long-standing practice in AI. Given the challenges of evaluating open-ended responses, many teams are looking at human evaluation as the North Star <span class="keep-together">metric</span> to guide their application development. Each day, you can use human experts to evaluate a subset of your application’s outputs that day to detect any changes in the application’s performance or unusual patterns in usage. For example, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/generative-ai/musings-on-building-a-generative-ai-product">LinkedIn</a> developed a process to manually evaluate up to 500 daily conservations with their AI <span class="keep-together">systems.</span></p>&#13;
<p>Consider evaluation methods to be used not just during experimentation but also during production. During experimentation, you might have reference data to compare your application’s outputs to, whereas, in production, reference data might not be immediately available. However, in production, you have actual users. Think about what kinds of feedback you want from users, how user feedback correlates to other evaluation metrics, and how to use user feedback to improve your application. How to collect user feedback is discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch10_ai_engineering_architecture_and_user_feedback_1730130985311851">Chapter 10</a>.</p>&#13;

          <section data-pdf-bookmark="Annotate evaluation data" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch04_annotate_evaluation_data_1730130866191281">&#13;
            <h3>Annotate evaluation data</h3>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="evaluation pipeline design" data-secondary="step 3: defining evaluation methods and data" data-tertiary="annotating evaluation data" data-type="indexterm" id="ch04.html47"/>Curate a set of annotated examples to evaluate your application. You need annotated data to evaluate each of your system’s components and each criterion, for both turn-based and task-based evaluation. Use actual production data if possible. If your application has natural labels that you can use, that’s great. If not, you can use either humans or AI to label your data. <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_dataset_engineering_1730130932019888">Chapter 8</a> discusses AI-generated data. The success of this phase also depends on the clarity of the scoring rubric. The annotation guideline created for evaluation can be reused to create instruction data for finetuning later, if you choose to finetune.</p>&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="slicing" data-type="indexterm" id="id1120"/>Slice your data to gain a finer-grained understanding of your system. Slicing means separating your data into subsets and looking at your system’s performance on each subset separately. I wrote at length about slice-based evaluation in <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://oreil.ly/J3pbA"><em>Designing Machine Learning Systems</em></a> (O’Reilly), so here, I’ll just go over the key points. A finer-grained understanding of your system can serve many purposes:</p>&#13;
            <ul> &#13;
<li><p>Avoid potential biases, such as biases against minority user groups.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Debug: if your application performs particularly poorly on a subset of data, could that be because of some attributes of this subset, such as its length, topic, or <span class="keep-together">format?</span></p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Find areas for application improvement: if your application is bad on long inputs, perhaps you can try a different processing technique or use new models that perform better on long inputs.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Avoid falling for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox">Simpson’s paradox</a>, a phenomenon in which model A performs better than model B on aggregated data but worse than model B on every subset of data. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch04_table_6_1730130866138430">Table 4-6</a> shows a scenario where model A outperforms model B on each subgroup but underperforms model B overall.</p>&#13;

<p>You should have multiple evaluation sets to represent different data slices. You should have one set that represents the distribution of the actual production data to estimate how the system does overall. You can slice your data based on tiers (paying users versus free users), traffic sources (mobile versus web), usage, and more. You can have a set consisting of the examples for which the system is known to frequently make mistakes. You can have a set of examples where users frequently make <span class="keep-together">mistakes—if</span> typos are common in production, you should have evaluation examples that contain typos. You might want an out-of-scope evaluation set, inputs your application isn’t supposed to engage with, to make sure that your application handles them appropriately.</p>&#13;
<p>If you care about something, put a test set on it. The data curated and annotated for evaluation can then later be used to synthesize more data for training, as discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_dataset_engineering_1730130932019888">Chapter 8</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>How much data you need for each evaluation set depends on the application and evaluation methods you use. In general, the number of examples in an evaluation set should be large enough for the evaluation result to be reliable, but small enough to not be prohibitively expensive to run.</p>&#13;
<p>Let’s say you have an evaluation set of 100 examples. To know whether 100 is sufficient for the result to be reliable, you can create multiple bootstraps of these 100 examples and see if they give similar evaluation results. Basically, you want to know that if you evaluate the model on a different evaluation set of 100 examples, would you get a different result? If you get 90% on one bootstrap but 70% on another bootstrap, your evaluation pipeline isn’t that trustworthy.</p>&#13;
<p>Concretely, here’s how each bootstrap works:</p>&#13;
            <ol>&#13;
<li><p>Draw 100 samples, with replacement, from the original 100 evaluation examples.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Evaluate your model on these 100 bootstrapped samples and obtain the evaluation results.</p></li>&#13;
            </ol>&#13;
<p>Repeat for a number of times. If the evaluation results vary wildly for different bootstraps, this means that you’ll need a bigger evaluation set.</p>&#13;
<p>Evaluation results are used not just to evaluate a system in isolation but also to compare systems. They should help you decide which model, prompt, or other component is better. Say a new prompt achieves a 10% higher score than the old prompt—how big does the evaluation set have to be for us to be certain that the new prompt is indeed better? In theory, a statistical significance test can be used to compute the sample size needed for a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95% confidence) if you know the score distribution. However, in reality, it’s hard to know the true score <span class="keep-together">distribution.</span></p>&#13;

Reliability is especially important with subjective evaluation methods such as AI as a judge.</p>&#13;
<p>Here are some questions you should be asking about the quality of your evaluation pipeline:</p>&#13;
            <dl>&#13;
              <dt>Is your evaluation pipeline getting you the right signals?</dt>&#13;
<dd><p>Do better responses indeed get higher scores? Do better evaluation metrics lead to better business outcomes?</p></dd>&#13;

<dd><p>If you run the same pipeline twice, do you get different results? If you run the pipeline multiple times with different evaluation datasets, what would be the variance in the evaluation results? You should aim to increase reproducibility and reduce variance in your evaluation pipeline. Be consistent with the configurations of your evaluation. For example, if you use an AI judge, make sure to set your judge’s temperature to 0.</p></dd>&#13;

        <h1>Summary</h1>&#13;
<p>This is one of the hardest, but I believe one of the most important, AI topics that I’ve written about. Not having a reliable evaluation pipeline is one of the biggest blocks to AI adoption. While evaluation takes time, a reliable evaluation pipeline will enable you to reduce risks, discover opportunities to improve performance, and benchmark progresses, which will all save you time and headaches down the line.</p>&#13;
<p>Given an increasing number of readily available foundation models, for most application developers, the challenge is no longer in developing models but in selecting the right models for your application. This chapter discussed a list of criteria that are often used to evaluate models for applications, and how they are evaluated. It discussed how to evaluate both domain-specific capabilities and generation capabilities, including factual consistency and safety. Many criteria to evaluate foundation models evolved from traditional NLP, including fluency, coherence, and faithfulness.</p>&#13;
<p>To help answer the question of whether to host a model or to use a model API, this chapter outlined the pros and cons of each approach along seven axes, including data privacy, data lineage, performance, functionality, control, and cost. This decision, like all the build versus buy decisions, is unique to every team, depending not only on what the team needs but also on what the team wants.</p>&#13;
<p>This chapter also explored the thousands of available public benchmarks. Public benchmarks can help you weed out bad models, but they won’t help you find the best models for your applications. Public benchmarks are also likely contaminated, as their data is included in the training data of many models. There are public leaderboards that aggregate multiple benchmarks to rank models, but how benchmarks are selected and aggregated is not a clear process. The lessons learned from public leaderboards are helpful for model selection, as model selection is akin to creating a private leaderboard to rank models based on your needs.</p>&#13;
<p>This chapter ends with how to use all the evaluation techniques and criteria discussed in the last chapter and how to create an evaluation pipeline for your application. No perfect evaluation method exists. It’s impossible to capture the ability of a high-dimensional system using one- or few-dimensional scores. Evaluating modern AI systems has many limitations and biases. However, this doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do it. Combining different methods and approaches can help mitigate many of these challenges.</p>&#13;
<p>Even though dedicated discussions on evaluation end here, evaluation will come up again and again, not just throughout the book but also throughout your application development process. <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06_rag_and_agents_1730157386571386">Chapter 6</a> explores evaluating retrieval and agentic systems, while Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch07.html#ch07">7</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch09.html#ch09_inference_optimization_1730130963006301">9</a> focus on calculating a model’s memory usage, latency, and costs. Data quality verification is addressed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08_dataset_engineering_1730130932019888">Chapter 8</a>, and using user feedback to evaluate production applications is addressed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch10_ai_engineering_architecture_and_user_feedback_1730130985311851">Chapter 10</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>With that, let’s move onto the actual model adaptation process, starting with a topic that many people associate with AI engineering: prompt engineering.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch04.html0" data-type="indexterm" id="id1133"/></p>&#13;

You don’t want an NPC to accidentally give players spoilers.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1031"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1031-marker">9</a></sup> However, the electricity cost might be different, depending on the usage.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1038"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1038-marker">10</a></sup> Another argument for making training data public is that since models are likely trained on data scraped from the internet, which was generated by the public, the public should have the right to access the models’ training data.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1041"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1041-marker">11</a></sup> In spirit, this restriction is similar to the <a href="https://oreil.ly/XaRwG">Elastic License</a> that forbids companies from offering the open source version of Elastic as a hosted service and competing with the Elasticsearch platform.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1043"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1043-marker">12</a></sup> It’s possible that a model’s output can’t be used to improve other models, even if its license allows that. Consider model X that is trained on ChatGPT’s outputs. X might have a license that allows this, but if ChatGPT doesn’t, then X violated ChatGPT’s terms of use, and therefore, X can’t be used. This is why knowing a model’s data lineage is so important.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1049"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1049-marker">13</a></sup> For example, as of this writing, you can access GPT-4 models only via OpenAI or Azure. Some might argue that being able to provide services on top of OpenAI’s proprietary models is a key reason Microsoft invested in OpenAI.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1052"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1052-marker">14</a></sup> Interestingly enough, some companies with strict data privacy requirements have told me that even though they can’t usually send data to third-party services, they’re okay with sending their data to models hosted on GCP, AWS, and Azure. For these companies, the data privacy policy is more about what services they can trust. They trust big cloud providers but don’t trust other startups.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1054"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1054-marker">15</a></sup> The story was reported by several outlets, including TechRadar (see <a href="https://oreil.ly/mlHyX">“Samsung Workers Made a Major Error by Using ChatGPT”</a>, by Lewis Maddison (April 2023).</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1058"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1058-marker">16</a></sup> As regulations are evolving around the world, requirements for auditable information of models and training data may increase. Commercial models may be able to provide certifications, saving companies from the effort.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1060"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1060-marker">17</a></sup> Users want models to be open source because open means more information and more options, but what’s in it for model developers? Many companies have sprung up to capitalize on open source models by providing inference and finetuning services. It’s not a bad thing. Many people need these services to leverage open source models. But, from model developers’ perspective, why invest millions, if not billions, into building models just for others to make money?It might be argued that Meta supports open source models only to keep their competitors (Google, Microsoft/OpenAI) in check. Both Mistral and Cohere have open source models, but they also have APIs. At some point, inference services on top of Mistral and Cohere models become their competitors.There’s the argument that open source is better for society, and maybe that’s enough as an incentive. People who want what’s good for society will continue to push for open source, and maybe there will be enough collective goodwill to help open source prevail. I certainly hope so.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1063"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1063-marker">18</a></sup> The companies that get hit the most by API costs are probably not the biggest companies. The biggest companies might be important enough to service providers to negotiate favorable terms.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1064"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1064-marker">19</a></sup> This is similar to the philosophy in software infrastructure to always use the most popular tools that have been extensively tested by the community.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1084"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1084-marker">20</a></sup> When I posted a question on Hugging Face’s Discord about why they chose certain benchmarks, Lewis Tunstall <a href="https://oreil.ly/eH7Ho">responded</a> that they were guided by the benchmarks that the then popular models used. Thanks to the Hugging Face team for being so wonderfully responsive and for their great contributions to the community.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1085"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1085-marker">21</a></sup> I’m really glad to report that while I was writing this book, leaderboards have become much more transparent about their benchmark selection and aggregation process. When launching their new leaderboard, Hugging Face shared <a href="https://oreil.ly/4X6Dm">a great analysis</a> of the benchmarks correlation (2024).</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1086"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1086-marker">22</a></sup> It’s both really cool and intimidating to see that in just a couple of years, benchmarks had to change from grade-level questions to graduate-level questions.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1087"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1087-marker">23</a></sup> In gaming, there’s the concept of a neverending game where new levels can be procedurally generated as players master all the existing levels. It’d be really cool to design a neverending benchmark where more challenging problems are procedurally generated as models level up.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1090"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1090-marker">24</a></sup> Reading about other people’s experience is educational, but it’s up to us to discern an anecdote from the universal truth. The same model update can cause some applications to degrade and some to improve. For example, migrating from GPT-3.5-turbo-0301 to GPT-3.5-turbo-1106 led to <a href="https://oreil.ly/4c6in">a 10% drop</a> in Voiceflow’s intent classification task but an <a href="https://oreil.ly/V48iM">improvement</a> in GoDaddy’s customer support chatbot.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1091"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1091-marker">25</a></sup> If there is a publicly available score, check how reliable the score is.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1092"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1092-marker">26</a></sup> The HELM paper reported that the total cost is $38,000 for commercial APIs and 19,500 GPU hours for open models. If an hour of GPU costs between $2.15 and $3.18, the total cost comes out to $80,000–$100,000.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1097"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1097-marker">27</a></sup> A friend quipped: “A benchmark stops being useful as soon as it becomes public.”</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1122"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1122-marker">28</a></sup> This is because the square root of 10 is approximately 3.3.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id1126"><sup><a href="ch04.html#id1126-marker">29</a></sup> For example, if there’s no correlation between a benchmark on translation and a benchmark on math, you might be able to infer that improving a model’s translation capability has no impact on its math capability.</p></div></div></section></body></html>
