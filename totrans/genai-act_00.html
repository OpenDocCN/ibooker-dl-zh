   <p>This section introduces the fundamental concepts and technologies that underpin generative AI. We start with a general overview of what generative AI can do, how it works, and how it can be applied in various enterprise settings. Then we examine the details of large language models (LLMs), such as their structures, categories, and main concepts. The final chapters in this section cover generating text, images, and similar things through APIs, offering a hands-on guide to accessing and utilizing these technologies.</p>
