<h1><span class="label">Chapter 2. </span>Introduction to LLMOps</h1>

<p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMOps (large language model operations)" data-type="indexterm" id="icd201"/> size and complexity of LLMs’ architecture can make<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="productionizing" data-type="indexterm" id="id445"/> productionizing these models incredibly hard. <em>Productionizing</em> means not just deploying a model but also monitoring it, evaluating it, and optimizing its performance.</p>

<p>There are constantly new challenges. Depending on your application, these may include how to process data, how to store and dynamically adapt prompts, how to monitor user interaction, and—most pressing—how to prevent the model from spreading misinformation or memorizing training data (which can lead it to release personal information). That’s why operationalizing LLMs, which means managing them day-to-day in production, requires a new framework.</p>

<p><em>LLMOps</em>, as it’s called, is an operational framework for putting LLM applications in production. Although its name and principles are inspired by its older siblings, MLOps and DevOps, LLMOps is significantly more nuanced. The LLMOps framework can help companies reduce technical debt, maintain compliance, deal with LLMs’ dynamic and experimental nature, and minimize operational and reputational risk by avoiding common pitfalls.</p>

<p>This chapter starts by discussing what LLMOps is and how and where it departs from MLOps. We’ll then introduce you to the LLMOps engineer role and where it fits into existing ML teams. From there, we’ll look at how to measure LLMOps readiness within teams, assess your organization’s LLMOps maturity, and identify crucial KPIs for measuring success. Toward the end of this chapter, we will outline some challenges that are specific to productionizing LLM applications.</p>

<h1 class="less_space">What Are Operational Frameworks?</h1>

<p><em>Operational frameworks</em> <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMOps (large language model operations)" data-secondary="operational frameworks" data-type="indexterm" id="id446"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="operational frameworks" data-type="indexterm" id="id447"/>provide a structured approach to managing complex workflows and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="workflows" data-seealso="operational frameworks" data-type="indexterm" id="id448"/>pipelines within an organization. These frameworks integrate tools and practices to automate and streamline organizational processes and ensure consistency and quality across the project lifecycle.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest operational frameworks can be traced back to military strategy and the Industrial Revolution. Two of the most popular ones, both<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Toyota" data-type="indexterm" id="id449"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Lean Production System" data-type="indexterm" id="id450"/> introduced in 1986, are <a href="https://oreil.ly/oNheh">Toyota’s Lean Production System</a>, which put Toyota ahead of most of its contemporaries,<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Motorola" data-type="indexterm" id="id451"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary=" Six Sigma" data-type="indexterm" id="id452"/> and <a href="https://oreil.ly/GHXWt">Six Sigma</a>, Motorola’s data-driven approach to improving processes and reducing defects.</p>

<p>In 2008, the tech industry began to adopt what is now one of the most popular operational frameworks in software:<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="DevOps" data-type="indexterm" id="id453"/> DevOps. (The term combines <em>software development </em>and <em>operations</em>.) In 2018, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="MLOps (machine learning operations)" data-secondary="rise of" data-type="indexterm" id="id454"/>MLOps, an operational framework for non-generative machine learning (ML) models, became the talk of the town; since then we’ve seen SecOps (Security Operations), DataSecOps, and many more.</p>

<p>With the massive adoption of LLMs in 2023, a new operational framework started floating around within companies that were building LLM applications: LLMOps. LLMOps is still in its infancy, but as generative models become integral to software products, its popularity is likely to boom.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_1_1748895480187715">Figure 2-1</a> shows the slow rise of Ops frameworks over the years. Use of LLMOps started to pick up with the mass adoption of LLMs in early 2023. As of this writing, more and more enterprises are realizing that they can add value and profit with LLM-based offerings, leading to an upward trend for LLMOps. In fact, 2025 may be the best year yet for LLMOps frameworks.</p>

<p>Deploying LLMs can be as simple as integrating a chatbot into your website via an API or as complicated as building your own LLM and frontend from scratch. But maintaining them to be performant (productionizing them)—that is, keeping them reliable, scalable, secure, and robust—is a massive challenge. This book, like LLMOps, is focused on exactly this question: what happens <em>after</em> you deploy your LLM in production?</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="From MLOps to LLMOps: Why Do We Need a New Framework?"><div class="sect2" id="ch02_from_mlops_to_llmops_why_do_we_need_a_new_framewo_1748895480209334">
<h2>From MLOps to LLMOps: Why Do We Need a New Framework?</h2>

<p>There<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMOps (large language model operations)" data-secondary="MLOps compared to" data-type="indexterm" id="icd203"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="MLOps (machine learning operations)" data-secondary="LLMOps compared to" data-type="indexterm" id="icd204"/> is some overlap between MLOps and LLMOps; both deal with the operational lifecycles of ML models, after all. They also share common principles in terms of managing ML workflows. However, the two frameworks diverge in their primary focuses and objectives. While MLOps handles non-generative models (both language and computer vision), LLMOps deals with generative language models—and thus with mammoth levels of complexity. The complexity of these models owes not only to their scale and architecture but also to the unique processes involved in data engineering, domain adaptation, evaluation, and monitoring for them. The key distinctions are apparent in LLMs’ prediction transparency, latency, and memory and computational requirements.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Perhaps the biggest difference is the shift in how end users consume these models. Non-generative ML models are predictive tools used for passive consumption, such as in dashboarding, recommendations, and analytics. By contrast, LLM applications are deployed as <a href="https://oreil.ly/g9dn6">Software 3.0</a> in consumer-facing applications for active user interaction. This brings several challenges from Software 1.0 (DevOps) back to the surface. In fact, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that LLMOps shares more similarities with DevOps <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="DevOps" data-type="indexterm" id="id455"/>than with MLOps.</p>

<p>Building your own generative AI application requires tools, frameworks, and expectations to match the scale and complexity of these models, and this is far beyond the scope of the existing MLOps solutions. To help you understand the differences between the various kinds of Ops frameworks, let’s do a thought experiment.</p>

<p>Imagine MLOps as being something like building a small home from the ground up. In comparison, DevOps, which deals with the entire product lifecycle, would be like developing a large shopping complex. And LLMOps? It’s more like building the Burj Khalifa. For all three frameworks, you are working with the same construction materials: wood, steel, concrete, bricks, hammers, and so on. Much of the basic process is the same, too: you lay down the foundation, lay down the plumbing, and finally build the walls. But you wouldn’t contract your local construction workers to engineer the Burj Khalifa, would you?</p>

<p>Most of MLOps for natural language modeling is based on building smaller, discriminative models<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="discriminative models" data-type="indexterm" id="id456"/> for tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and summarization. For these tasks, you first hypothesize ideal features, model your data as a function of those features, and then optimize the model for that specific task.</p>

<p>LLMs, by contrast, are generative, domain agnostic, and task agnostic. That fundamental difference means you can use the same model for summarizing or for answering questions, without having to fine-tune it.</p>

<p>The best use cases for LLMs are when you don’t know what features to optimize for (or, even better, if the features are too abstract) and when you need to model multimodal data within a single pipeline. Unlike smaller discriminative models, LLMs don’t rely on predefined features or task-specific architectures. Instead, as you learned in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_introduction_to_large_language_models_1748895465615150">Chapter 1</a>, they are trained on vast amounts of text data to learn the patterns and structures in language itself. For LLMs, the training process involves a<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="loss functions" data-type="indexterm" id="id457"/> <em>loss function</em>, which measures how well the model’s generated outputs match the expected outputs across various tasks. For example, during training, the model might generate a sequence of text; the loss function calculates the difference between this generated sequence and the target sequence.</p>

<p>Additionally, for a standard comparison, the hyperparameter space for a 175-billion parameter GPT-4 <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenAI" data-secondary="GPT series" data-type="indexterm" id="id458"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="generative pretrained transformer (GPT) series" data-type="indexterm" id="id459"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GPT (generative pretrained transformer) series" data-type="indexterm" id="id460"/>​model would likely be approximately 1,500 times larger than that for a standard discriminative BERT model (which has 110 million parameters). This makes it incredibly costly to fine-tune and do the kind of iterative training that is typical in MLOps. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_table_1_1748895480195288">Table 2-1</a> outlines some of the key differences between the MLOps and LLMOps <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="accuracy" data-secondary="LLMOps versus MLOps" data-type="indexterm" id="id461"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data collection" data-secondary="LLMOps versus MLOps" data-type="indexterm" id="id462"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="evaluation" data-secondary="LLMOps versus MLOps" data-type="indexterm" id="id463"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="robustness" data-secondary="LLMOps versus MLOps" data-type="indexterm" id="id464"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="costs" data-secondary="LLMOps versus MLOps" data-type="indexterm" id="id465"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="security" data-secondary="LLMOps versus MLOps" data-type="indexterm" id="id466"/>model <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMOps (large language model operations)" data-secondary="MLOps compared to" data-startref="icd203" data-type="indexterm" id="id467"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="MLOps (machine learning operations)" data-secondary="LLMOps compared to" data-startref="icd204" data-type="indexterm" id="id468"/>lifecycles.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Four Goals for LLMOps"><div class="sect2" id="ch02_four_goals_for_llmops_1748895480209396">
<h2>Four Goals for LLMOps</h2>

<p>LLMOps<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMOps (large language model operations)" data-secondary="goals of" data-type="indexterm" id="id469"/> operates on an LLM-specific set of design pattern principles to ensure that your LLM applications achieve four key goals: security, scalability, robustness, and reliability. Let’s take a closer look at these goals:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Security</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Minimizing<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="security" data-secondary="as goal of LLMOps" data-secondary-sortas="goal of LLMOps" data-type="indexterm" id="id470"/> the regulatory, reputational, and operational risks associated with deploying LLM applications in production</p>

	<dd>
	<p>Maintaining<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="robustness" data-secondary="as goal of LLMOps" data-secondary-sortas="goal of LLMOps" data-type="indexterm" id="id472"/> high performance of LLM applications over time in the face of data drift, model drift, third-party updates, and other challenges</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Reliability</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Implementing<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="reliability" data-secondary="as goal of LLMOps" data-secondary-sortas="goal of LLMOps" data-type="indexterm" id="id473"/> rigorous inference monitoring, error handling, and redundancy mechanisms to prevent downtime and failures</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>LLMOps teams automate repetitive processes to more quickly optimize these applications at scale and avoid those “LLM-oops!” moments. Another key aspect of the LLMOps framework is fostering consistency, transparency, and collaboration between diverse interdisciplinary teams. These teams often include data engineers, data scientists, research scientists, software engineers, and business operations teams.</p>

<p>LLMOps is an entirely new field, so, as of this writing in 2025, there are very few mature tools and resources available. The LLMOps teams at various organizations are thus developing their tools and processes internally, based on prototypical open source libraries and toolkits.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="LLMOps Teams and Roles"><div class="sect1" id="ch02_llmops_teams_and_roles_1748895480209472">
<h1>LLMOps Teams and Roles</h1>

<p>Today,<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMOps (large language model operations)" data-secondary="teams and roles" data-type="indexterm" id="icd205"/> there are two kinds of companies out there building with LLMs: the newer startups, which focus primarily on LLM applications, and companies with existing ML models that are now building their own GenAI teams.</p>

<p>In the latter category, there are so few skilled Ops professionals that most companies recruit ML engineer candidates internally and then upskill them to LLMOps, instead of hiring externally. A major reason for this is a general lack of clarity around use cases as well as the expected job responsibilities. So the current norm is to hire 8 to 10 people internally from different departments, which could include product managers, full-stack engineers, system architects, data engineers, data scientists, ML engineers, platform engineers, cybersecurity professionals, and developer advocates. Many companies want someone who already understands the business inside and out to test the feasibility of several potential use cases and projects before committing to one.</p>

<p>Newer startups, however, have no choice but to build a team from the ground up. These teams can look very different, depending on whether they are working on LLMOps infrastructure (LLMOps SaaS companies) or LLM use cases such as copywriting, education, or process optimization. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_2_1748895480187751">Figure 2-2</a> provides a very basic model of an LLMOps team, but these teams come in all shapes and sizes, with different levels of business and technical maturity.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMOps (large language model operations)" data-secondary="team structure" data-type="indexterm" id="id474"/> (Later in the chapter, we’ll look at how to assess your company’s LLMOps maturity.)</p>

<figure><div id="ch02_figure_2_1748895480187751" class="figure"><img alt="" src="assets/llmo_0202.png" width="1410" height="1086"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 2-2. </span>Structure of an LLMOps team</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Most companies cannot afford the cost of building and training an LLM for use in their application. Instead, most choose to use a foundational model. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="AI engineers" data-tertiary="role of" data-type="indexterm" id="icd201x"/>This is where AI engineers come in: to build a quick proof of concept using LLMOps tools. Most come from a software-engineering background; they may know how to build a full-stack application quickly, but don’t necessarily have a deep understanding of ML/LLM models’ inner workings or how to optimize them.</p>

<p>Once the proof of concept is completed, building, deploying, and optimizing ML models for the business falls to LLM engineers, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ML (machine learning)" data-secondary="ML scientists" data-type="indexterm" id="icd211x"/>​ML scientists (interchangeable titles, depending on the organization), and LLMOps <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMOps engineers" data-secondary="role of" data-type="indexterm" id="icd206"/>​engineers tasked as reliability <span class="keep-together">engineers.</span></p>

<p>If a team chooses to deploy an LLM application using API integration, the initial deployment will be pretty straightforward. The LLMOps engineers work alongside AI engineers to scale the model and improve its performance. Ideally, each AI engineer is paired with an LLMOps engineer; the AI engineer can focus on adapting and fine-tuning the model to meet the business needs, while the LLMOps engineer manages deployment and optimization. For open source models, managing deployment automatically falls to the LLMOps engineer.</p>

<p>As the tech industry moves from non-generative models to generative models, it is shifting away from<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="feature engineering" data-type="indexterm" id="id475"/> feature engineering, or creating features to model the data and experimenting with different hyperparameters to optimize performance. Generative models, and specifically LLMs, do not require feature engineering. Today, the core requirements are usually prompt engineering or building a RAG pipeline—skills that lie within the domain of AI engineers.</p>

<p>Another big shift is that the data engineering pipeline and the monitoring and evaluation pipeline have become far more complex. Evaluating LLMs is much more than straightforward quantitative scoring. Some industry benchmarks<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ROUGE" data-type="indexterm" id="id476"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="BLEU" data-type="indexterm" id="id477"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="benchmarks, for LLM performance" data-type="indexterm" id="id478"/> exist—like <a href="https://oreil.ly/OxqU2">BLEU</a>, a benchmark used to evaluate machine translation, and <a href="https://oreil.ly/1y3e4">ROUGE</a>, a benchmark used to evaluate summarization, but these are only loosely correlated with application performance. Moving to a model that has a better score is no guarantee of better user satisfaction. Standardized scores may be good for comparing LLMs in general, but ultimately users care about whether the LLM application is solving their problem.</p>

<p>In addition, since LLMs are deployed in consumer-facing applications, metrics like perceived latency and throughput become make-or-break factors in market competition. The model is not the only deciding factor: the deployment, evaluation, and monitoring pipelines are also at the front and center of performance assessment.</p>

<p>Let’s look at some of the roles involved in these pipelines:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Data engineer</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Data engineers<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data engineers" data-secondary="role of" data-type="indexterm" id="id479"/> are professionals responsible for designing, building, and maintaining systems and pipelines that enable the efficient collection, storage, and transformation of data as well as access to it. Their work ensures that data is available, reliable, and organized in a way that allows data scientists and other engineers to create and evaluate models and data-driven applications. Data retrieval and movement are the most fundamental skills for data engineers, but as they progress in their career, developing data architectures becomes more <span class="keep-together">important.</span></p>

	<p>Data engineering for LLMs requires specialized understanding: how to chunk the data, what tokenization model to use, and so on. Thus, it’s best to pair each data engineer with an ML scientist (with an LLM engineering background) along with the LLMOps engineer for automating and streamlining LLM systems at scale.</p>

	<dt>AI engineer</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="AI engineers" data-startref="icd201x" data-tertiary="role of" data-type="indexterm" id="id480"/> core skill set of an AI engineer is full-stack engineering and development (React, Node.js, Django) plus familiarity with the common LLMOps tools and frameworks for deploying applications, like <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LangChain" data-type="indexterm" id="id481"/>LangChain and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Llama Index" data-type="indexterm" id="id482"/>Llama Index. They need a foundational understanding of end-to-end AI application development, including prompt engineering and RAG systems. Companies building their teams from scratch usually look to hire AI engineers who also know a lot about using cloud services to deploy and manage AI applications and have experience working with external APIs and vector databases.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>ML scientist</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ML (machine learning)" data-secondary="ML scientists" data-startref="icd211x" data-type="indexterm" id="id483"/> day-to-day work of an ML scientist, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="NLP (natural language processing)" data-secondary="ML scientists" data-type="indexterm" id="id484"/>NLP scientist, or LLM engineer involves researching, designing, and optimizing LLMs using frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. This role requires a deep understanding of NLP algorithms and tasks, such as tokenization, named-entity recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and machine translation. Candidates should know model architectures and training and fine-tuning processes.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>LLMOps engineer</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The goal  of an LLMOps engineer is to ensure that LLM applications remain reliable, robust, secure, and scalable. The day-to-day work involves building and maintaining operational LLM pipelines as a project owner.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>Let’s now look at the LLMOps engineer role in more detail.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="The LLMOps Engineer Role"><div class="sect2" id="ch02_the_llmops_engineer_role_1748895480209534">
<h2>The LLMOps Engineer Role</h2>

<p>This role requires extensive expertise in deploying, monitoring, fine-tuning, training, scaling, and optimizing LLM models in production environments; infrastructure and platform engineering; data engineering; and system reliability.</p>

<p>Companies building LLM teams usually seek LLMOps engineers who understand the unique challenges associated with LLMs and are experienced in making build-versus-buy trade-off, including by weighing cost efficiency against system performance.</p>

<p>To stand out as a candidate for this role, you’ll need proficiency in a unique blend of specialized skills and a deep technical understanding of the entire LLM lifecycle, from data management to model deployment and monitoring. You’ll also need to be a problem solver, a strong team player, and an effective communicator as well as meticulously detail oriented.</p>

<p>To illustrate what this means in practice, let’s look at a typical day in the work life of a fictional LLMOps engineer.</p>

<h2>A Day in the Life</h2>

<p>While <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMOps engineers" data-secondary="day in the life of" data-type="indexterm" id="id485"/>the specific responsibilities for this role will vary across organizations, the core tasks typically encompass a blend of infrastructure management, collaboration, optimization, and compliance. To give you a quick taste of what this looks like in practice, here’s what a typical LLM engineer’s workday might look like:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>7:30 AM–8:30 AM: Morning check-in</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Review monitoring dashboards for any overnight alerts or performance issues in deployed LLMs; address any urgent issues or escalate them to the appropriate teams.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Lead the team’s daily stand-up meeting to discuss ongoing projects, blockers, and priorities for the day.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>8:30 AM–10:00 AM: Infrastructure management and optimization</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Modularize code for reusability​, creating separate modules for provisioning GPUs, managing storage, and networking.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Implement batching mechanisms to process multiple inference requests, reducing the per-request overhead.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Implement latency optimization techniques like kernel fusion, quantization, and dynamic batching to enhance model performance.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>10:00 AM–11:30 AM: Collaboration and project planning meeting</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Meet with data scientists, ML engineers, and red teaming engineers to discuss usage requirements, timelines, monitoring errors, and scaling challenges.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>11:30 AM–12:30 PM: API development and model deployment</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>

	</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>12:30 PM–1:30 PM: Lunch break</dt>
	<dt>1:30 PM–3:00 PM: Monitoring and troubleshooting</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Troubleshoot any issues that arise. For example, let’s say the users are experiencing long delays when making requests to the inference API. The engineer would identify the source of latency by examining hardware utilization and network latency and reviewing usage logs. They would then implement a solution; e.g., using a Pod Autoscaler or caching the frequent requests.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>3:00 PM–4:30 PM: Research and continuous learning</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>

		</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>4:30 PM–5:30 PM: End-of-day wrap-up, review, and on-call prep</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Review the day’s tasks and update the tickets with completed tasks and next steps.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Prepare for any on-call duties, ensuring that all monitoring systems are correctly configured and that you’re ready to respond to any incidents.</p>
		</li>

<p>Every company, of course, has its own interviewing process. Some conduct many rounds of interviews; others combine several of the interviews<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="interviewing potential LLMOps engineers" data-type="indexterm" id="jc2.1"/> into a single on-site meeting. This section describes a fairly standard four-round interview process, as pictured in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_figure_3_1748895480187773">Figure 2-3</a>.</p>

	<dt>Final round: Behavioral interview</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>In<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="behavioral interviews" data-type="indexterm" id="id490"/> the fourth round, you’ve narrowed the pool to the most qualified candidates. Now you need to assess their personalities: Are they self-driven? Can they work in a team, handle challenges with equanimity, and contribute to a collaborative environment? Sample questions:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>How do you stay up-to-date on the latest advancements in LLMs and machine learning operations?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>How do you approach integrating data scientists’ feedback into the deployment process?</p>

<h2>Hiring Internally: Upskilling an MLOps Engineer <span class="keep-together">into an LLMOps Engineer</span></h2>

<p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMOps engineers" data-secondary="upskilling MLOps engineers into" data-type="indexterm" id="id493"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="MLOps (machine learning operations)" data-secondary="upskilling MLOps engineers into LLMOps engineers" data-type="indexterm" id="id494"/> gap between MLOps engineers and LLMOps engineers is significant in terms <span class="keep-together">of the</span> scale, complexity, and the technical challenges involved in their roles. <span class="keep-together">Thus, upskilling</span> an existing employee requires a focused effort to build their <span class="keep-together">understanding.</span></p>

<p>That said, the foundational skills of MLOps—such as model deployment, automation, and cloud management—provide a solid base from which to grow. With dedicated learning and hands-on experience, an MLOps engineer can transition into the LLMOps domain effectively. The core upside of hiring internally is that candidates are already aligned with the organization’s values and culture and have a keen understanding of its KPIs.</p>

<p>To excel, new LLMOps engineers need resources and training to deepen their understanding of large-scale model architectures and transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, infrastructure management, and LLM-specific optimization techniques. They also need to understand how LLMs differ from non-generative ML models. We recommend pairing them up with LLM engineers to experiment with and evaluate different models.</p>

<p>This role isn’t just about building an app that uses LLMs. LLMOps engineers also manage the balance among cost, cloud resources, and user experience and handle huge unstructured datasets. Therefore, pair them with data engineers to help build a data-processing pipeline so they can familiarize themselves with the data sources at their disposal, how the data is structured in the databases, how different databases retrieve information, what the company’s latency expectations are, and how to handle data filtering. Allow them to introduce multi-node setups and distributed systems for different models while focusing on cost optimization and errors. Get them to benchmark different LLM models and debug their performance optimization. Finally, allow them to present their logging practices and the guardrails they have set up for maintaining reliability and performance at scale.</p>

<p>Most MLOps engineers already have skills in model versioning, data versioning, managing rollbacks, and GitHub actions, so upskilling these professionals can be an effective strategy for building a strong LLMOps team.</p>

<p>Next, let’s look at how to make sure the goals of your LLMOps engineers are aligned with your <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMOps engineers" data-secondary="hiring" data-startref="icd207" data-type="indexterm" id="id495"/>​organizational <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMOps (large language model operations)" data-secondary="teams and roles" data-startref="icd205" data-type="indexterm" id="id496"/>goals.</p>

<h1>LLMs and Your Organization</h1>

<p>You<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMOps (large language model operations)" data-secondary="metrics for performance" data-type="indexterm" id="icd208"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="metrics" data-type="indexterm" id="icd208a"/> learned at the beginning of this chapter that the four key goals of the LLMOps framework are security, scalability, robustness, and reliability. For LLMOps teams, then, the next big question is how to measure the application’s performance against those goals. How will you know you’re succeeding? The company’s expectations should be clearly defined and remain quantitatively, as well as qualitatively, measurable at all times.</p>

<p>Three kinds of metrics will allow you to measure your team’s performance toward its goals: <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="metrics" data-secondary="SLOs, SLAs, and KPIs" data-type="indexterm" id="icd220x"/>SLOs, SLAs, and KPIs. These terms are in common usage among site reliability engineers, and now LLMOps teams are rapidly adopting them as well:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Service-level objectives (SLOs)</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Service-level objectives<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="SLOs (service-level objectives)" data-type="indexterm" id="icd209x"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="service-level objectives (SLOs)" data-type="indexterm" id="icd210x"/> are specific, measurable targets set by an organization to gauge the quality of its services internally. They define what level of service the organization aims to achieve. For example, an SLO for a cloud-hosting company might be to ensure that server uptime is at least 99.9% per month.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Service-level agreements (SLAs)</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Service-level agreements<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="SLAs (service-level agreements)" data-type="indexterm" id="icd221x"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="service-level agreements (SLAs)" data-type="indexterm" id="icd215x"/> are formal contracts between a service provider and a customer that define the level of service the provider commits to deliver. They typically include specific performance goals and stipulate remedies if those metrics are not met. For example, if the uptime for an internet provider falls below 99.9% annually, the SLA might stipulate that the customer will receive a 10% discount on its next billing cycle.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Key performance indicators (KPIs)</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Key<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="KPIs (key performance indicators)" data-type="indexterm" id="icd213x"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="key performance indicators (KPIs)" data-type="indexterm" id="icd214x"/> performance indicators measure the overall success and performance of specific business activities. They provide insight into how well the organization is achieving its strategic objectives. For example, an important KPI for an app might be its churn rate or the percentage of customers who stop using the app over a certain period.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p class="pagebreak-before">In August 2024, a<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Gartner Research" data-type="indexterm" id="id497"/> <a href="https://oreil.ly/dIBVc">Gartner Research study predicted</a> that 30% of existing GenAI projects would fail by 2025. (In fact, Gartner <a href="https://oreil.ly/Rq3K3">published similar findings</a> in 2018, <span class="keep-together">predicting</span> that 85% of ML projects would fail in production by 2022.) The key <span class="keep-together">failure points</span> outlined in the 2024 study are notable because they are the operational aspects of LLM development and <span class="keep-together">deployment—including</span> data quality issues, the lack of a strong evaluation framework, and the high costs of scaling these models in <span class="keep-together">production.</span></p>

<p>That said, one of the most obvious issues is mismatched expectations between management and engineering teams. For the last 10 years, one of data scientists’ biggest skill gaps has been in translating ML model metrics into organizational and product success metrics. In other words, when you’re measuring abstract goals like model security, scalability, robustness, and reliability, how do you communicate what this means for the business? That’s what SLOs, SLAs, and KPIs are for.</p>

<p>Using an SLO-SLA-KPI framework allows LLMOps teams to automate, streamline, and manage expectations across multiple stakeholders. SLOs make it evident to all stakeholders what level of service is being aimed for. SLAs ensure accountability so that everyone involved is aware of their roles and the agreed-upon service levels. This can also help you track performance and address any deviations from the expected standards. And KPIs provide visibility into real-time data to help detect potential issues early, facilitating informed decision-making.</p>

<p>Let’s<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMOps (large language model operations)" data-secondary="goals of" data-type="indexterm" id="icd209"/> look more closely at the LLMOps goals to see how these metrics translate.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Reliability"><div class="sect2" id="ch02_reliability_1748895480209849">
<h2>Reliability</h2>

<p>As <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="reliability" data-secondary="as goal of LLMOps" data-secondary-sortas="goal of LLMOps" data-type="indexterm" id="id498"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="reliability" data-secondary="metrics for" data-type="indexterm" id="id499"/>you<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="metrics" data-secondary="reliability" data-type="indexterm" id="id500"/> know well by now, LLMs are extremely complex, with billions of parameters. Their behavior can be unpredictable, and they sometimes exhibit unexpected responses or errors due to their scale and the intricacies of their training data. Additionally, if the training data is biased, outdated, or unrepresentative of certain domains, the model’s performance can be unreliable in those areas.</p>

<p>LLMs also struggle at times with understanding the context, nuance, and intent behind user queries. This can lead to incorrect, irrelevant, or misleading responses. What’s more, LLMs usually aren’t updated in real time. As language evolves, if new information is not integrated into the training data via regular retraining, models can become outdated, leading to decreased reliability.</p>

<p>All of these issues come down to reliability. The reliability of LLM-based applications can be measured in terms of system availability, error rates, and customer satisfaction. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_table_2_1748895480195314">Table 2-2</a> shows how these metrics would look as SLOs, SLAs, and KPIs.</p>

Distributing a model across multiple GPUs or nodes while maintaining performance is technically challenging. Handling large volumes of data efficiently is <span class="keep-together">critical.</span></p>

<p>Another significant challenge is scaling the data pipeline to feed data into the model at the required speed without causing bottlenecks. This can be especially hard for applications like chatbots or interactive services, where low latency is crucial. Scaling while keeping response times low can be challenging, since scaling up increases resource contention and network overhead. Therefore, balancing performance with cost efficiency is a constant concern.</p>

<p>LLMOps scalability can be measured via metrics like <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="latency" data-secondary="metrics for" data-type="indexterm" id="id504"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="throughput" data-type="indexterm" id="id505"/>latency, throughput, response time, resource scaling, capacity planning, and recovery time objective (RTO), as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_table_3_1748895480195328">Table 2-3</a>.</p>

<p>When all teams—whether they are involved in development, operations, or management—understand the agreed-upon service levels and performance indicators, they can work together more effectively toward common goals. This alignment fosters a unified approach to managing and improving project performance. It also helps in making data-backed decisions about resource allocation,<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="resource allocation" data-type="indexterm" id="id517"/> process changes, and strategic adjustments. Most importantly, it helps in building trust and ensuring that everyone is on the same page regarding expectations and outcomes.</p>

<h1>The LLMOps Maturity Model</h1>

<p>LLMOps<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LLMOps (large language model operations)" data-secondary="maturity levels" data-type="indexterm" id="icd210"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="maturity model and levels" data-type="indexterm" id="icd211"/> maturity is a way of determining how well an organization’s LLM operations align with industry best practices and standards. Assessing LLMOps maturity helps organizations identify their strengths, areas for improvement, and opportunities for scaling and enhancing the robustness of their LLM systems.</p>

<p>A few years ago, Microsoft<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Microsoft machine learning operations maturity model" data-type="indexterm" id="id527"/> published a <a href="https://oreil.ly/1Tjgw">machine learning operations maturity model</a> detailing a progressive set of requirements and stages to measure the maturity of <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="MLOps (machine learning operations)" data-secondary="maturity model" data-type="indexterm" id="icd212x"/>MLOps production environments and processes. The LLMOps maturity model we present here, inspired by Microsoft’s MLOps model, is meant to do the same for LLMOps teams. Although this is by no means a comprehensive audit, we hope to see several variations put into practice.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">The three LLMOps maturity levels are as follows:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Level 0</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>No LLMOps practices are implemented. The organization’s lack of formal structures and processes for managing and deploying its LLM systems hinders its effectiveness.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Level 1</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The organization applies MLOps practices but without LLM-specific adaptations. This is an improvement over Level 0 in terms of formalization and processes but still lacks the sophistication needed for full LLM operations.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Level 2</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Achieving Level 2 represents a mature LLMOps state, characterized by advanced documentation, robust monitoring and compliance measures, and the integration of sophisticated orchestration and human review strategies. Usually, this can be assessed by asking some questions about whether decision strategies and model performance measures and metrics are well documented within the team.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>Various measures of LLMOps maturity levels are outlined in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_table_6_1748895480195357">Table 2-6</a>.</p>

<p>Documenting the factors shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch02_table_6_1748895480195357">Table 2-6</a> can be incredibly helpful when choosing and deploying any new model. For example, given the significant costs that are associated with deploying an LLM application, cost-benchmark analysis documentation allows the company to decide which model to roll into production and estimate the project timeline.</p>

<p>After deployment, the company also needs to assess how well the team has documented the model’s performance measures and metrics. This is to make sure that everyone on the team understands the expectations and that they are comprehensively monitoring the model performance in production.</p>
