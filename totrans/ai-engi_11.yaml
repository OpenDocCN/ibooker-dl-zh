- en: The hardest part of technical writing isn’t finding the correct answers but
    asking the right questions. Writing this book inspired me to ask many questions
    that guided me toward fun and useful discoveries. I hope the book sparked some
    interesting questions for you as well.

    models. There’s no doubt that this number will grow exponentially in the future.
    More systematic approaches to AI engineering, such as those introduced in this
    book, will make the development process easier, enabling even more applications.
    If there are any use cases you want to discuss, don’t hesitate to reach out. I
    love hearing about interesting problems and solutions. I can be reached via X
