<div class="calibre1" id="sbo-rt-content"><h1 class="tochead" id="heading_id_2">Appendix. <a id="idTextAnchor000"/>Setting things up</h1>
<p class="body">In the first couple of chapters in this book, I explain in some detail why and how you should select a quality hosting service for your website. And then, after setting up an account with that service, you install a new, empty WordPress site on that account. We’ll use that site throughout this book as a practice site. You’re free to work on an existing site, of course, but it might be easier to work on a practice site now, and then apply what you’ve learned to your real site later. Or you can ignore the WordPress examples in the book, and just focus on learning how to use AI in general. The choice is yours. But what follows is the short version of the process if you want to get things set up more quickly.<a id="idIndexMarker000"/><a id="marker-334"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_3">A.1 Setting up your practice site</h2>
<p class="body">Some of the examples throughout the book are illustrated using the setup described here. If you decide to set up a practice site, follow these steps:</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   1.  Sign up with a hosting service. A very good choice is DreamHost. They are usually the least expensive of the top-three hosting services recommended by WordPress itself. During the signup process, you’ll be asked to make up a username/password pair. Be sure to write them down on paper. If you need any assistance with the setup process, contact DreamHost tech support by googling <code class="fm-code-in-text">dreamhost</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">tech</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">support</code><i class="fm-italics">.</i> (In addition to DreamHost, WordPress also recommends Bluehost and SiteGround. Both are quality site hosts.)<a id="idIndexMarker001"/></p>
<p class="body-dialog">   2.  Install a new, empty WordPress site on your new account. And, be sure to write down on paper the username/password pair that you made up for the site (this isn’t the same pair that you made up for your hosting service account). Normally, installing a new WordPress site is quite easy to do right after creating your hosting account. But again, if you need assistance, all three recommended hosts have a great tech support staff.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   3.  Go now to your WordPress practice site’s backend. (The <i class="fm-italics">frontend</i> is the site as your audience sees it; the <i class="fm-italics">backend</i> is where you build and update the site behind the scenes.) The backend is also known as your site’s <i class="fm-italics">dashboard.</i> When you set up your hosting account, you choose a unique internet address name (URL), such as <i class="fm-italics">mysitename.com</i>. Getting to the backend is easy: just append <i class="fm-italics">/wp-admin</i> to get <i class="fm-italics">mysitename.com/wp-admin</i>. Type that into a browser’s address field, provide the WordPress username/password you wrote down, and you’re in! Now, you can add pages to the site, modify the look, and customize how the site behaves.<a id="idIndexMarker002"/><a id="idIndexMarker003"/><a id="idIndexMarker004"/></p>
<p class="body-dialog">   4.  Change the theme. Every WordPress site has a theme. So, go to the practice site’s Appearance &gt; Themes screen in your backend (click Themes as shown in figure A.1). Then, click the Add New button.<a id="marker-335"/></p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figuree"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="654" src="../../OEBPS/Images/APPA_F01_Mansfield.png" width="829"/></p>
<p class="figurecaptione">Figure A.1 Here’s where you change a site’s theme—it governs the overall default appearance of the site.</p>
</div>
<p class="body-dialog">   5.  In the Search Themes field on the right, type <code class="fm-code-in-text">twenty sixteen</code> (no hyphen).</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   6.  When you see that theme, move your mouse pointer onto it, and then click its Install button. Finally, click the Activate button. You’ve now made Twenty Sixteen the theme for your practice site, and what you see in that site will resemble the figures and instructions throughout the book.</p>
<p class="fm-calloute"><span class="fm-callout-head">Warning</span> In the next step, you’ll see two address URLs. Don’t change them, or you’ll create serious problems.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   7.  To change your site’s title and tagline (slogan), go to your site’s Settings &gt; General screen. Type <code class="fm-code-in-text">Time</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">Tested</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">Recipes</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">for</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">the</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">Instant</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">Pot</code> as your practice site’s title, and <code class="fm-code-in-text">Comfort</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">food</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">for</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">beginners</code> as the site’s tagline (see figure A.2).</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figuree"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="506" src="../../OEBPS/Images/APPA_F02_Mansfield.png" width="973"/></p>
<p class="figurecaptione">Figure A.2 Here’s where you give your site a title and a slogan or catchphrase.</p>
</div>
<p class="fm-calloute"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> Your site title and tagline are really important, so take some time to find the perfect words. Eye tracking research has revealed that people commonly scan your site’s pages in an F-shaped pattern. In other words, it’s typical, even on cellphones, for a visitor to read the site title first (the first horizontal line in the F pattern) read the tagline next (the second horizontal line), and then scan down the left side of the page (the F’s stem). So, in addition to perfecting the title and tagline, you’ll also want to note that people are likely to focus more on the first several words on the left side of the page, while scanning down vertically.

<p class="body">One final adjustment is needed: go to your site’s Plugins &gt; Add New screen. Search for the <code class="fm-code-in-text">Classic</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">Editor</code> plugin, and then install and activate it. Also, install and activate the Classic Widgets plugin as well. They will switch your site’s editor from the default Gutenberg block editor to the traditional WordPress editor. Many experts prefer the classic editor for reasons described in chapter 1. You can, however, easily switch to Gutenberg any time by just deactivating these plugins. The Classic Widgets plugin only affects one screen in your backend, the Appearance &gt; Widgets screen. (For each exercise involving WordPress, I provide instructions for both the classic editor and Gutenberg.) You’re now set up and ready to start chapter 1.<a id="idIndexMarker005"/><a id="idIndexMarker006"/><a id="idIndexMarker007"/><a id="marker-337"/></p>
