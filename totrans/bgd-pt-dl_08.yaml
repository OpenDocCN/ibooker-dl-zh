    the next step is to look at how to deploy PyTorch applications in production.
    In this chapter, we create applications that run inference on PyTorch models over
    HTTP and gRPC. We then package those applications into Docker containers and deploy
    them to a Kubernetes cluster running on Google Cloud.

    with quantization. First up, let’s look at model serving.

- en: We’ve spent the last six chapters building models in PyTorch, but building a
    model is only part of building a deep learning application. After all, a model
    may have amazing accuracy (or other relevant metric), but if it never makes any
    predictions, is it worth anything? What we want is an easy way to package our
    models so they can respond to requests (either over the web or other means, as
    we’ll see) and can be run in production with the minimum of effort.

    the Flask framework. In this section, we build a simple service that loads our
    ResNet-based cat or fish model, accepts requests that include an image URL, and
    returns a JSON response that indicates whether the image contains a cat or a fish.

    that it is either a fish or a cat. It has no concept of anything but the available
    choices and will always pick one. Some deep learning practitioners add an extra
    class, `Unknown`, during training and throw in labeled examples that aren’t any
    of the required classes. This works to a certain extent, but it essentially tries
    to make the neural net learn everything that isn’t a cat or fish, which is difficult
    for you and me to express, let alone a series of matrix calculations! Another
    option is to look at the probability output generated by the final `softmax`.
    If the model is producing a prediction that is roughly 50/50 cat/fish or spread
    out across your classes, then maybe suggest `Unknown`.

    In our `predict()` method, we pull out the `img_url` parameter from either a `GET`

    `torchvision` transform pipeline to resize it and turn the image into a tensor.
  prefs: []

    works, we need to turn it into a batch of size 1 — that is, `[1,3,224,224]`. So
    we use `unsqueeze()` again to expand our tensor by inserting a new empty axis
    in front of the existing dimensions. We can then pass it through the model as
    usual, which gives us our prediction tensor. As we have done previously, we use
    `torch.argmax()` to find the element of the tensor with the highest value and
    use that to index into the `CatfishClasses` array. Finally, we return a JSON response
    with the name of the class and the image URL we performed the prediction on.

    to save a model after training, either by writing the entire model to disk with
    `torch.save()` or by saving the `state_dict()` of all the weights and biases of
    the model (but not the structure). For our production-based service, we need to
    load in an already-trained model, so what should we use?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    model is an attractive option, but you will become incredibly sensitive to any
    changes in the model structure or even the directory structure of the training
    setup. That’s likely to cause a problem with loading it up in a separate service

    image in a container, which is an isolated process on your system that can see
    only the files you’ve specified and the programs you’ve told it to run. You can
    then share the Dockerfile so people can build their own images, but a more common
    approach is to push the created image to a registry, which is a list of Docker
    images that can be downloaded by anybody with access. These registries can be
    public or private; the Docker corporation runs [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com),

    this method now sends off a message to a logger or an external resource, providing
    important details such as the image URL, the predicted class, the actual prediction
    tensor, and even the complete image tensor just in case the supplied URL is transient.
    We also include a generated universally unique identifier (UUID), so that this
    prediction can always be uniquely referenced at a later time, perhaps if its predicted
    class needs to be corrected. In an actual deployment, you’d include things like
    `user_id`s and such so that downstream systems can provide a facility for users
    to indicate whether the prediction was correct or incorrect, sneakily generating
    more training data for further training iterations of the model.

    differentiation. The eager method allows you to do all sorts of dynamic approaches
    to specifying and training models that makes PyTorch appealing for research purposes.
    On the other hand, the graph-based representation may be static, but it gains
    power from that stability; optimizations may be applied to the graph representation,
    safe in the knowledge that nothing is going to change. And just as TensorFlow
    has moved to support eager execution in version 2.0, version 1.0 of PyTorch introduced
    TorchScript, which is a way of bringing the advantages of graph-based systems
    without completely giving up the flexibility of PyTorch. This is done in two ways
    that can be mixed and matched: tracing and using TorchScript directly.'

    instantiated in training mode. During training in many models such as AlexNet,
    we use a `Dropout` layer that randomly kills activations as a tensor goes through
    a network. What the JIT has done is send the random tensor we’ve generated through
    the model twice, compared them, and noted that the `Dropout` layers don’t match.
    This reveals an important caveat with the tracing facility; it cannot cope with
    nondeterminism or control flow. If your model uses these features, you’ll have
    to use TorchScript directly for at least part of your conversion.

    using `@torch.jit.script_method`. Second, although we could have traced each separate
    layer individually, we took advantage of the `nn.Sequential` wrapper layer to
    fire the trace through just that instead. You could implement the `classifier`
    block yourself to get a feel for how this mixing works. Remember that you’ll need
    to switch the `Dropout` layers into `eval()` mode instead of training, and your
    input trace tensor will need to be of shape `[1, 256, 6, 6]` because of the downsampling
    that the `features` block carries out. And yes, you can save this network by using
    `torch.jit.save` just as we did for the traced module. Let’s have a look at what
    TorchScript allows and forbids.

    for interacting with PyTorch. Various levels of C++ interaction are available.
    The lowest levels are `ATen` and `autograd`, the C++ implementations of the tensor
    and automatic differentiation that PyTorch itself is built on. On top of those
    are a C++ frontend, which duplicates the Pythonic PyTorch API in C++, an interface
    to TorchScript, and finally an extension interface that allows new custom C++/CUDA
    operators to be defined and exposed to PyTorch’s Python implementation. We’re
    concerned with only the C++ frontend and the interface to TorchScript in this
    book, but more information on the other parts is available [in the PyTorch documentation](https://oreil.ly/y6NP5).

    sure that it is maintaining accuracy, retraining and testing against baselines,
    and more complicated versioning schemes than the ones I’ve introduced here for

    training and inference. Also, if you read about PyTorch model exports, you’re
    almost certainly going to come across a lot of references to the Open Neural Network
    Exchange (ONNX). This standard, jointly authored by Microsoft and Facebook, was
    the main method of exporting models before the advent of TorchScript. Models can
    be exported via a similar tracing method to TorchScript and then imported in other
    frameworks such as Caffe2, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, and MXNet. ONNX is still
    supported and actively worked in PyTorch v1.x, but it appears that TorchScript
    is the preferred way for model exporting. See the “Further Reading” section for
    more details on ONNX if you’re interested.
