- en: I was once asked whether AI will replace product managers. I responded by [quoting](https://oreil.ly/y1MZZ)
    Harvard Business School professor Dr. Karim Lakhani:“AI won’t replace humans—but
    humans with AI will replace humans without AI.” In this instance, product managers
    will not be replaced by AI; product managers who don’t leverage AI will be replaced
    by product managers who do.

    that can enhance your craft if as one. A clarification: in recent conversations,
    I’ve noticed a common misconception—people often use the terms *AI product management*
    and *AI for product managers* interchangeably. While they might sound similar,
    these are two distinct concepts. Understanding the difference is crucial for grasping
    the broader landscape of AI’s role in product development.'

    that are inherently powered by AI technologies. This role involves a deep collaboration
    with data scientists, ML engineers, designers, and other stakeholders to integrate
    AI into user experiences.'

    can leverage AI to enhance their product management craft, whether they’re working
    on an AI product or focusing on another (non-AI-powered product) area. These tools
    use AI to streamline various aspects of the product development lifecycle, such
    as sifting through vast amounts of market data to identify trends, or analyzing
    user feedback to highlight common pain points. This isn’t about building AI into
    your product; it’s about *using* AI to build a better product.'

- en: Before we dive in, I should tell you that while I’ve mapped these tools to the
    different stages of the AIPDL where they can best help you, the mapping in [Table 7-1](#ch07_table_1_1736793248027419)
    is just a guideline. Many of these tools are applicable in multiple stages of
    the AIPDL, and in some cases, the entire lifecycle. This framework is intended
    to give you a head start, but how you choose to leverage these tools will vary
    based on your workflow and evolving needs.

- en: 'Additionally, each PM may have a completely different workflow, based on how
    they decide to incorporate AI into their work. These workflows evolve as new tools
    emerge and as advancements in AI provide new capabilities. Experimenting with
    different AI tools will allow you to craft a system that works best for you—and
    this system will likely change as you and the tools develop. While the following
    tools are among those that I recommend, there are others that I use throughout
    the AIPDL: for example, Google Gemini as a one-stop-shop tool and NotebookLM,
    which helps process large amounts of information and makes it more applicable
    to the use case I have in hand, i.e., adding as an input a two hour-long YouTube
    video and getting almost instantly the key points that are relevant to my work.'

    mindful of the privacy and security of any confidential information you’re sharing.
    Some of these tools might handle sensitive data, so it’s always a good idea to
    consult with your company’s privacy and legal teams to determine which tools are
    appropriate to use and which are not. Please note that the tooling landscape changes
    extremely fast. I update my [newsletter](https://marily.substack.com) with the
    latest resources and tools.'

- en: I’ve outlined how AI tools can empower product managers throughout the entire
    AIPDL, from ideation to rollout. These tools serve not only to streamline your
    workflows, but also to enhance decision making and drive strategic insights that
    would be impossible without AI. It’s not about building AI into your products
    exclusively, but about using AI to amplify your own capabilities as a product
    manager. As the landscape of AI tools evolves, your role in product development
    will continue to expand, and those who leverage these tools effectively will stay
    ahead in an increasingly competitive market.

    presented in this chapter are just a starting point. Your unique work style, your
    company’s structure, and the evolving nature of AI technology will continuously
    influence how you utilize these tools. And, as always, exercise caution when using
    third-party AI tools—always consult your company’s privacy and security teams
    to ensure compliance.
