- en: Now that you are familiar with the fundamental idea of RAG and the components
    of a RAG system, the second part of the book will guide you through building a
    basic RAG system with the core pipelines and their evaluation. This part of the
    book not only offers theoretical details, but also simple code snippets that will
    provide you with hands-on experience in building a RAG pipeline.

    components: loading, chunking, embeddings, and vector storage. Each of these components
    has a variety of techniques to choose from. This chapter also discusses the suitability
    of these options for different use cases. Step by step, you’ll build an indexing
    pipeline and create the knowledge base for your RAG system.'

    output generation. These elements form the three components of the generation
    pipeline: retrieval, augmentation, and generation. In this chapter, you will build
    the generation pipeline that interacts with the knowledge base, created using
    the indexing pipeline in chapter 3\.'

    crucial step in AI systems. You will learn about the different metrics used in
    RAG evaluation for measuring accuracy, relevance, and faithfulness. You will also
    be introduced to the RAGAs framework to evaluate the pipelines built in chapters
    3 and 4, and learn about industry benchmarks popular in comparing different RAG
    techniques. The chapter closes with a discussion on the limitations and best practices
    of RAG evaluation.

- en: This part of the book will equip you with all the necessary skills and tools
    to develop a basic RAG pipeline. By the end of this part, you will be in a good
    position to further explore the techniques used to optimize any RAG pipeline and
    the components that are key in building a production-grade system around it.
