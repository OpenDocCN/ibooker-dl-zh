    We can define them as direct interfaces to advanced functionalities, interconnecting
    Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI (or OpenAI’s ChatGPT) with other systems. For example,
    there are [plug-ins](https://oreil.ly/MIQOJ) from companies such as Expedia, FiscalNote,
    Instacart, KAYAK, Klarna, Milo, OpenTable, Shopify, Slack, Speak, Wolfram, and
    Zapier. They are external to Azure OpenAI, and their nature and business models

    models (LLMs) and enable a deep integration of GPT across Azure and the Microsoft

    documents as the main source of knowledge, in addition to the base LLM. If we
    want to combine the LLM’s knowledge with the information from those images and
    PDFs, we need to extract the information from those documents in advance, and
    have it transformed from the source to relevant formats such as JSON or JSONL.
  id: totrans-116
  prefs: []

    (optical character recognition](https://oreil.ly/f3IcI)). This is a mature technique
    that recognizes every character of a document, to read and extract its information
    for later use.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we want to leverage native Azure services to perform OCR tasks, there is
    an Azure AI service called [AI Document Intelligence (previously called Form Recognizer)](https://oreil.ly/f6YWE).
    From the official website, it is “an AI service that applies advanced machine
    learning to extract text, key-value pairs, tables, and structures from documents
    automatically and accurately.” This is a preliminary step before performing fine-tuning,
    embeddings, etc. This [official article](https://oreil.ly/2D87V) explains the
    end-to-end process that combines AI Document Intelligence and Azure OpenAI Service
    to directly launch queries against the document.
