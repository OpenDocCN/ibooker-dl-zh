    books and magazines can display images, they can’t include audio or video. In
    almost every site, you want to add at least some video and certainly images. Audio
    is optional, and relatively less common.

    visuals gets 94% more views! (See [https://mng.bz/av4x](https://mng.bz/av4x) for

    too few, and the site becomes static and might look forbiddingly full of gray
    text. Too many, and your audience will likely become distracted and perhaps annoyed
    because the pages lack focus.

    There’s a range of the number of media you should use, depending on the site’s

    images, and so can an e-commerce site featuring a catalog of goods. A lawyer’s
    site—attempting to avoid the appearance of frivolity—can be expected to display
    fewer visuals.

    small files. So it’s usually not a problem to store them in your Media Library.

    So, a 5-minute video is roughly the equivalent of 9,000 images, or 1,350 MB. (This

    eats up memory fast.)'

    to better arrange the images on your bass fishing site’s home page:Top Image Representing
    the Page’s Topic:Ensure the highest image (the one with the fishing rods over
    the lake) effectively represents the topic of bass fishing. This image is well-placed
    but might benefit from a clearer, high-resolution version to grab attention immediately.White
    Space and Image Breaks:The text below the top image appears to be crowded. Adding
    white space between the image and the text will enhance readability and make the
    page look cleaner.Consider adding smaller, related images or icons next to the
    paragraphs to break up the text and maintain the reader’s interest.Consistent
    Image Placement:The images of fish in the lower section are well-arranged. However,
    ensure consistency in the alignment. If possible, make sure all images in this
    section are of the same size and aligned uniformly. This helps maintain a clean,
    organized look.Captions for Images:Add captions below each image to provide context.
    For example, include the fish species name or any relevant information that the
    visitors might find useful.Mobile Layout Check:Ensure the images and text layout
    work well on mobile devices. Sometimes large images or closely packed elements
    can look cluttered on smaller screens. Use responsive design techniques to adjust
    image sizes and spacing accordingly.White Space around Images:Each image should
    have sufficient white space around it to avoid a cramped look. Ensure there’s
    enough padding or margins to separate images from text and other elements.Logo
    Placement:Your logo is placed on the top left, which is ideal. Ensure it’s visible
    and distinct from the background to improve brand recognition.By following these
    suggestions, your home page will look more organized, visually appealing, and
    easier to navigate, which can enhance user experience and engagement. |'

    and they rewrite it, retaining the meaning of the text without simply replicating
    it. QuillBot ([https://quillbot.com/](https://quillbot.com/)) is a popular one.
    They say they have 50 million users. That application includes several features
    such as a plagiarism checker. I asked QuillBot to paraphrase the first half of
    an earlier paragraph in this section that starts with *Courts exist* . . .. Here’s
    QuillBot’s revision:'

    necessary. For instance, occasionally someone files a lawsuit against an artist
    over the similarities between their song and a subsequent song (typically one
    that was quite successful). There are varying degrees of similarity, thus the
    accusation needs to be evaluated*. |'

    Like QuillBot, it has additional capabilities, such as allowing you to select
    a writing style (casual, formal), specify sentence length by shortening or expanding
    sentences, and others. Several reviewers say that Undetectable ([www.undetectable.ai](https://www.undetectable.ai))
    is the best at these tasks.

    was among several ways to share the video. So, if you see that embed icon (refer
    to figure 8.6), the owner of the video has implicitly granted permission to embed
    their video in websites. The embed option can be turned off, but you have to take

    Several online sources offer stock photos, music, and videos that you don’t have
    to pay for or get permission to use. However, you want to read their terms of
    service or licensing requirements because *free* doesn’t always mean *free from
    restrictions*.

    as you include attribution, or provide a link back to their site. Other free content

    to allow content creators—video makers, photographers, artists, and musicians—to
    retain their copyrights while still permitting others (like us) limited use of
    the creations. The organization offers several variations of licenses that creators
    can choose from, granting various kinds of specific permissions for others to
    use their works. Some such licenses require that any derivative works (variations
    on the original) be in turn licensed under the same terms. Others forbid derivative
    works entirely. Some require attribution or noncommercial use only.'

- en: At the time of this writing Gutenberg, the WordPress block editor’s audio and
    video blocks can be slow to load, and with some media, they don’t work at all.
    I recommend using third-party audio and video blocks. Click the + icon in the
    block editor to open the library of blocks, and then search for `audio` or `video`.
    You can find the built-in WordPress players, as well as quite a few third-party
    blocks. And, below that is a list of plugins that can be installed, as shown in
    figure 8.11.

    or more of these several purposes—providing fresh content, allowing your audience
    to interact with your site, offering customer service, and marketing your wares.
    The one drawback can be that if you permit your audience to send messages to the
    blog, you have to check that they are appropriate—not incendiary, vulgar, or otherwise
    unpublishable. Fortunately, WordPress includes some tools that can semiautomate
    this vetting process. AI can also make these judgements with considerable skill,

    compared to text files. Even a standard definition video is roughly 20 times larger
    than an audio file of the same duration. So, your best tactic is to embed these
    media rather than trying to house them in your Media Library. Page load times
    will be faster, and you won’t burden your site’s database with unnecessary file
    storage.
