- en: In [Part III](#part_applications), we will explore some of the key applications
    of the generative modeling techniques that we have seen so far, across images,
    text, music, and games. We will also see how these domains can be traversed using
    state-of-the-art multimodal models.

- en: In [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#chapter_transformer) we shall turn our attention to
    Transformers, a start-of-the-art architecture that powers most modern-day text
    generation models. In particular, we shall explore the inner workings of GPT and
    build our own version using Keras, and we’ll see how it forms the foundation of
    tools such as ChatGPT.

- en: In [Chapter 10](ch10.xhtml#chapter_image_generation) we will look at some of
    the most important GAN architectures that have influenced image generation, including
    ProGAN, StyleGAN, StyleGAN2, SAGAN, BigGAN, VQ-GAN, and ViT VQ-GAN. We shall explore
    the key contributions of each and look to understand how the technique has evolved
    over time.

- en: '[Chapter 11](ch11.xhtml#chapter_music) looks at music generation, which presents
    additional challenges such as modeling musical pitch and rhythm. We’ll see that
    many of the techniques that work for text generation (such as Transformers) can
    also be applied in this domain, but we’ll also explore a deep learning architecture
    known as MuseGAN that applies a GAN-based approach to generating music.'

- en: '[Chapter 12](ch12.xhtml#chapter_world_models) shows how generative models can
    be used within other machine learning domains, such as reinforcement learning.
    We will focus on the “World Models” paper, which shows how a generative model
    can be used as the environment in which the agent trains, allowing it to train
    within a hallucinated dream version of the environment rather than the real thing.'

- en: In [Chapter 13](ch13.xhtml#chapter_multimodal) we will explore state-of-the-art
    multimodal models that cross over domains such as images and text. This includes
    text-to-image models such as DALL.E 2, Imagen, and Stable Diffusion, as well as
    visual language models such as Flamingo.

- en: Finally, [Chapter 14](ch14.xhtml#chapter_conclusion) summarizes the generative
    AI journey so far, the current generative AI landscape, and where we may be heading
    in the future. We will explore how generative AI may change the way we live and
    work, as well as considering whether it has the potential to unlock deeper forms
    of artificial intelligence in the years to come.
