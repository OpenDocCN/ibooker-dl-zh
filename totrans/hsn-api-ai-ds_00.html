<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>To succeed in AI, first master APIs. Becoming skilled at APIs is more valuable than ever, thanks largely to the growth of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science.</p>

<p>But learning a such wide-ranging skill is intimidating. How is it to be done? You can take comfort in the fact that you don’t have to learn every skill, and certainly not all at once. Pick up one skill at a time through hands-on practice. Each skill you learn makes the next one easier, like building blocks.</p>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Why Should You Read This Book?"><div class="sect1" id="id368">
<h1>Why Should You Read This Book?</h1>

<p>If you’re reading this book, you want to build your skills. I have found that the best way to do that is through hands-on coding. If you do your coding in the open by publishing your code in a public repository and blogging and sharing what you create, you can pass along your knowledge to help others. You’ll also build a solid portfolio of work that provides a concrete demonstration of your expertise to employers.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Who This Book Is For"><div class="sect1" id="id369">
<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>

<p>Since this book sits at the intersection of APIs, AI, and data science, it will be valuable to several types of readers.</p>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Data Scientists"><div class="sect2" id="id370">
<h2>Data Scientists</h2>

<p>Data scientists use APIs all the time, so there’s a temptation to think there’s nothing new to learn about using APIs. Isn’t calling an API just a few lines of code? It’s true that making one call to a REST API is a simple task, which is certainly a reason they have become so prevalent. But using an API in a way that is robust and resilient—and that doesn’t cause problems for the provider—requires more care.</p>

<p class="less_space pagebreak-before">This book will teach some techniques you may not have learned yet, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Developing and deploying APIs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating software development kits (SDKs) and API clients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating and publishing Python packages to PyPI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publishing machine learning models as APIs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating Streamlit data apps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating Airflow data pipelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating generative AI applications using LangChain and ChatGPT</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div></section>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="API Developers and Designers"><div class="sect2" id="id371">
<h2>API Developers and Designers</h2>

<p>API developers and designers can learn how to enhance their APIs for important new audiences. They’ll learn about data scientists: the jobs they do, the tasks they perform, and the API features they love. They’ll also learn about generative AI applications: how they call APIs and what features they need in an API.</p>

<p>And the hands-on examples will teach a variety of new skills:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Creating Python APIs with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Pydantic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Containerizing APIs with Docker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deploying APIs to cloud hosts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating Python SDKs and publishing to PyPI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating generative AI applications using LangChain and ChatGPT</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Job Seekers and Role Changers</h2>

<p>The skills above are valuable in the marketplace, so learning them can help you find your first role or a new role in data science or software development. This book is arranged around building portfolio projects, which will give you specific goals to accomplish, and tangible evidence of your work.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Using This Book"><div class="sect1" id="id223">
<h1>Using This Book</h1>

<p>Instead of reading this book<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="portfolio projects" data-secondary="about" data-tertiary="using this book" id="id403"/> from beginning to end, I recommend that you pick the skill you want to learn and start working through the chapter that teaches it. You can do this quickly in the following way:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Decide whether you want to start by creating an API (<a data-type="xref" href="part01.html#part_1">Part I</a>), using APIs with data science (<a data-type="xref" href="part02.html#part_2">Part II</a>), or using APIs with AI (<a data-type="xref" href="part03.html#part_3">Part III</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the instructions in the introductory chapter of that part to clone the GitHub repository and launch a Codespace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the instructions in the relevant chapter and run the code.</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>If I’ve done my job properly, each chapter can stand on its own. After you’ve learned one skill, look around and find another skill you want to learn, and do the same. The skills in this book are like building blocks: each piece you learn prepares you to understand the other parts more deeply. All of them together give you quite a substantial understanding of APIs in data science and AI.</p>
</div></section>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="What This Book Is Not"><div class="sect1" id="id1">
<h1>What This Book Is Not</h1>

<p>This book doesn’t teach Python syntax to beginners. You will get the most from the coding examples if you have a foundational knowledge of Python. Although you can probably get the code to work by following the steps in each chapter, I suggest you begin with one of the excellent introductory Python books that O’Reilly publishes,<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Introducing Python, 3rd Edition (Lubanovic)" id="id404"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Lubanovic, Bill" id="id405"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Python" data-secondary="book for learning about" id="id406"/> such as <em>Introducing Python, 3rd Edition</em>, by Bill Lubanovic.</p>

<p class="less_space pagebreak-before">This book also assumes a basic understanding of using the command-line terminal in Linux or Unix. You don’t need to be a Linux administrator, but you should be familiar with running commands in the terminal as a developer. (All the steps are explained, but when you run into an issue, you might get frustrated without some background in that environment.)</p>

<p>The book introduces several useful Python frameworks such as FastAPI, Pydantic, Streamlit, Airflow, and LangChain. However, it does not address detailed topics necessary to run them in a <em>production</em> environment, such as security, performance, and infrastructure. I hope that you’ll enjoy the projects in this book enough that you’ll continue your learning using the references that I mention at the end of each chapter.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the services and tools in this book are changing rapidly, so depending on when you are reading this, some of the steps and figures may look a bit <span class="keep-together">different.</span></p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Why Fantasy Football?"><div class="sect1" id="id2">
<h1>Why Fantasy Football?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were to sit down and rank hobbies that people obsess over the details of, fantasy sports and software development would both be near the top of that list. When you combine these hobbies, the possibilities are endless!</p>
<p data-type="attribution">Joey Greco, <cite>creator of the Leeger stats application</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The portfolio projects in the book<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Greco, Joey" id="id407"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fantasy football" data-secondary="about" id="id408"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="portfolio projects" data-secondary="about" data-tertiary="fantasy football" id="id409"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SportsWorldCentral (SWC)" data-secondary="about fantasy football" id="id410"/> follow the story of an imaginary fantasy sports <span class="keep-together">league</span> host website: SportsWorldCentral.com. Through your projects, you will design and build APIs for data-focused users, then switch roles and build data science and generative AI applications using the APIs you created.</p>

<p>As Joey Greco says so eloquently, fantasy sports was the natural choice for the scenario. (You’ll hear more from him later in the book.) Fantasy sports is a natural playground for data scientists, and fantasy websites use plenty of APIs.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fantasy football" data-secondary="fantasy managers" id="id411"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SportsWorldCentral (SWC)" data-secondary="about fantasy football" data-tertiary="fantasy managers" id="id412"/> I’ve spent many hours over the years wading into both of those as a devoted (or addicted) fantasy manager. Fantasy managers are also fast adopters of any predictive or prescriptive analytics feature the fantasy websites give them. (If you doubt it, you haven’t watched a manager pick up two free agents and make three lineup changes to push their win probability from 45% to 53%.)</p>

<p>Fantasy sports are a fun way to geek out on the overlap between AI, data science, and APIs. As you code your way through the book, I hope you have as much fun as I did writing it.</p>
