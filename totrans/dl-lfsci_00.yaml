- en: In recent years, life science and data science have converged. Advances in robotics
    and automation have enabled chemists and biologists to generate enormous amounts
    of data. Scientists today are capable of generating more data in a day than their
    predecessors 20 years ago could have generated in an entire career. This ability
    to rapidly generate data has also created a number of new scientific challenges.
    We are no longer in an era where data can be processed by loading it into a spreadsheet
    and making a couple of graphs. In order to distill scientific knowledge from these
    datasets, we must be able to identify and extract nonobvious relationships.

- en: One technique that has emerged over the last few years as a powerful tool for
    identifying patterns and relationships in data is *deep learning*, a class of
    algorithms that have revolutionized approaches to problems such as image analysis,
    language translation, and speech recognition. Deep learning algorithms excel at
    identifying and exploiting patterns in large datasets. For these reasons, deep
    learning has broad applications across life science disciplines. This book provides
    an overview of how deep learning has been applied in a number of areas including
    genetics, drug discovery, and medical diagnosis. Many of the examples we describe
    are accompanied by code examples that provide a practical introduction to the
    methods and give the reader a starting point for future research and exploration.
