    it as a function of the values preceding time *t*. For example, say you want to
    predict the value of the time series at time step 1,200 as a function of the 30
    values preceding it. In this case, the values from time steps 1,170 to 1,199 would
    determine the value at time step 1,200 (see [Figure 10-2](#ch10_figure_2_1748549713788360)).

    you’ll go beyond a simple DNN and examine the implications of using an RNN to
    predict sequential values.
