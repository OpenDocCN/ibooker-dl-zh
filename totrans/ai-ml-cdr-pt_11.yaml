    But before you start creating models, you need to understand how to structure
    the time series data for training predictive models by creating what we’ll call
    a *windowed dataset.*

    in [Chapter 9](ch09.html#ch09_understanding_sequence_and_time_series_data_1748549698134578).
    You can see a plot of it in [Figure 10-1](#ch10_figure_1_1748549713788310).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If at any point, you want to predict a value at time *t*, you’ll want to predict
    it as a function of the values preceding time *t*. For example, say you want to
    predict the value of the time series at time step 1,200 as a function of the 30
    values preceding it. In this case, the values from time steps 1,170 to 1,199 would
    determine the value at time step 1,200 (see [Figure 10-2](#ch10_figure_2_1748549713788360)).
