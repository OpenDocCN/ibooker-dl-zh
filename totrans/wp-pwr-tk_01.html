<p class="body">Starting off in the right direction matters a lot when building a website. Whether your site achieves your goals or fails can sometimes depend on choices you make before even creating your first page.</p>
<p class="body">For one thing, there are two versions of WordPress, and if you select the wrong one, you can struggle with limitations and inflexibility from then on. In addition, you have to choose a quality hosting service, which stores your site on a server in the cloud. Choose the wrong one, and when you need technical assistance (and we all do now and then), you’ll get delays, bad advice, or no response at all! This chapter is all about making the right moves before you even start deciding on your site’s structure and design.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_3">2.1 Choosing the right version of WordPress</h2>
<p class="body">WordPress comes in two distinct versions: WordPress.com and WordPress.org. Most experts agree that, of the two versions, WordPress.org is superior to WordPress.com.<a id="idIndexMarker001"/><a id="idIndexMarker002"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">note</span> The terms <i class="fm-italics">org</i> and <i class="fm-italics">com</i> here just identify these two versions of WordPress, and have nothing to do with .com, .edu, .net (called <i class="fm-italics">domain extensions</i>) and other short abbreviations that are appended to internet website addresses like cnn.com or Wikipedia.org.<a id="idIndexMarker003"/><a id="marker-36"/></p>
<p class="body">Your first decision when starting a website is which version of WordPress you’ll use. Recall that WordPress <i class="fm-italics">can</i> be installed on your hard drive, but this isn’t recommended. You would have to handle technical problems such as security, uptime, and many other tasks best left to a WordPress hosting service located in the cloud. A key benefit of a hosting service is that you have access to tech support when something goes wrong.</p>
<p class="body">So, why not choose WordPress.com? There is a free hosting plan at the website named WordPress.com. But that free version has limitations—no plugins allowed, for example. However, for small, simple, personal blogs, it can be sufficient. WordPress.com does also offer premium, paid plans, but many reviewers say they’re not a good value when compared to independent hosting services like SiteGround.com, Bluehost.com, or DreamHost.com.</p>

<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">note</span> Recall that a plugin is a small app that you add to your WordPress site to provide additional functionality such as a rotating slideshow or automatic site backups. Chapter 5 is all about choosing the best plugins.</p>
<p class="body">If you’re planning a site that goes beyond a simple personal blog, you’ll want to sign up with a different hosting service than WordPress.com. And when you sign up with a different hosting service, you’ll automatically be using the WordPress.org version instead of the WordPress.com version because hosting services don’t use the WordPress.com version.</p>
<p class="body">The WordPress.org version is open source and free to use. But quality hosting services do charge a fee. Here are some of the major advantages of a paid hosting service:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">You can expect high-quality, rapid tech support.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">You can add functionality via tens of thousands of plugins.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Whereas customization is limited in WordPress.com’s free plan, premium hosts don’t restrict modifications.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">They usually offer better performance, such as faster page-load times.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">You’ll get more utilities and features, such as greater bandwidth, more storage, and free site migration.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">The paid hosting plans make it far easier to make money from your site.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">If you want to use a premium hosting service and avoid a large up-front investment, you can usually find trial offers under $3 monthly (like cable TV promotional offers, the price does go up after the offer expires). Some hosts also offer a money-back guarantee. If you want to learn more about why most experts recommend using the WordPress.org version, you can find more information in this useful tutorial: <a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/PNVR">https://mng.bz/PNVR</a>.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_4">2.2 Signing up with a first-rate hosting service</h2>
<p class="body">A WordPress website normally resides on a server in the cloud. These servers are maintained by hosting services that, in addition to tech support, also offer various utilities such as security systems, a file manager, and encryption. It’s <i class="fm-italics">possible</i> to host a WordPress site from your hard drive, but that requires a fair amount of technical skill, and you become responsible for security and other features best provided by a hosting service. Put bluntly, it’s not worth it. Here are some advantages of using a hosting service instead of hosting your site on your own hard drive:<a id="idIndexMarker004"/><a id="idIndexMarker005"/><a id="marker-37"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Reliability</i>—Hosting services have a team of experts who are responsible for keeping your website up and running 24/7. You can lose your audience quickly if your site is frequently down.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Security</i>—Good hosts have powerful security measures in place to protect your website from attacks. WordPress sites are a popular target for hackers.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Performance</i>—Hosts’ dedicated servers are optimized for WordPress. Your pages will load faster and be more responsive than if your site is located on your own hard drive. Note that some of your audience will have slow internet connections, and page-load times can determine whether or not a visitor returns to your site.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Ease of use</i>—Hosts include a set of utilities (in a location <a id="idTextAnchor001"/>named cPanel or Site Tools). You’ll find a utility that installs secure socket layer (SSL; so when someone visits your site, they don’t see the alarming notice: <i class="fm-italics">Not secure</i>). Hosts also provide many other useful tools, including automatic backups, updating, file management, and a “staging” area where you can modify your site offline, among other features.<a id="idIndexMarker006"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Cost</i>—Over time, a host can be more affordable than buying and maintaining your own server.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Support</i>—Last but by far not least is support. You’ll want a quality tech support team available for a rapid solution to technical problems. They need to be knowledgeable, respond quickly, and be easily contacted via chat, email, or phone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_5">2.2.1 Choosing your domain name</h3>
<p class="body">When you first sign up for a hosting service account, you’ll be asked to choose a <i class="fm-italics">domain name</i>. This is the URL, the unique address on the internet of your site’s <i class="fm-italics">home page</i>. Examples of URLs are bbc.com, amazon.com, and facebook.com.<a id="idIndexMarker007"/><a id="idIndexMarker008"/><a id="idIndexMarker009"/><a id="marker-38"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">DEFINITION</span> A site’s <i class="fm-italics">home page</i> is the first page in your site. It’s what visitors see when they arrive at your site. You might also see it called the landing, splash, main, index, front, start, and first page<i class="fm-italics">.<a id="idIndexMarker010"/></i></p>
<p class="body">Every page and every blog post also have their own URLs (interior page and post URLs are called <i class="fm-italics">permalinks)</i> but the site’s <i class="fm-italics">domain name</i> is the URL of its home page. So that’s the link that when clicked in a search engine list takes a visitor to your home page. Note that permalinks are normally composed of the site name plus a slug (often the title of the interior page). An example of a permalink is <i class="fm-italics">cnn.com/world</i>.<a id="idIndexMarker011"/></p>
<p class="body">People used to struggle to get the best possible domain name for their site—finding one that’s descriptive and short—in other words, <i class="fm-italics">memorable</i>. But by now, all the good, unforgettable ones are taken (or are being warehoused until someone is willing to pay a fortune for them). Voice.com was sold in 2019 for $30 million to Block.one, a blockchain technology company.</p>
<p class="body">So don’t torment yourself trying to figure out a perfect domain name, just try to work your site’s best <i class="fm-italics">keyword</i> into your new domain name. A keyword is a word or phrase that someone looking for a site like yours might likely type into AI or Google. <a id="idIndexMarker012"/></p>
<p class="body">For example, if you’re creating a cooking site, get the word <i class="fm-italics">recipes</i> or <i class="fm-italics">cooking</i> somewhere in the domain name. <i class="fm-italics">koolrecipes.com</i> is just fine. These days, people don’t usually remember most domain names. Instead, they’ll arrive at your site via a search engine, an AI platform, a bookmark in their browser, or a link to your site that they found on some other site.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">NOTE</span> Google is rapidly transforming itself from a search engine into an AI system. It needs to compete with GPT and other AIs or lose business.</p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_6">2.2.2 Setting up a practice site</h3>
<p class="body">In the appendix, you can find instructions to set up a hosting service account, install WordPress on that account, and install the Twenty Sixteen default WordPress theme that you can use if you want to work with a practice site for this book. Finally, the appendix describes how to go to your site’s Settings &gt; General screen and name the site title <code class="fm-code-in-text">Time</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">Tested</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">Recipes</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">for</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">the</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">Instant</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">Pot</code>, with the tagline <code class="fm-code-in-text">Comfort</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">food</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">for</code> <code class="fm-code-in-text">beginners</code>. If you haven’t yet set up a practice site, please visit the appendix and do that now if you want to use a practice site. Some of the examples throughout this book are based on the setup described in that appendix. But you can work on your real site instead if you choose.<a id="idIndexMarker016"/><a id="idIndexMarker017"/><a id="marker-39"/></p>
<p class="body">When choosing a hosting provider, look for a reliable and affordable company with a good reputation. As is so often the case, the most widely advertised services aren’t necessarily the best choices. GoDaddy, f<a id="idTextAnchor002"/>or example, has a sizeable market share. But it gets mixed reviews.</p>
<p class="body">Finding a solid hosting service can be daunting. There are an estimated 330,000 WordPress hosting services worldwide! But WordPress.org itself recommends only these three hosts: SiteGround, Bluehost, or DreamHost. Not coincidentally, I also recommend those three, for the reasons listed a bit further on.</p>
<p class="body">Each of these hosting services is an excellent choice, with great tech support, solid performance, and a suite of utilities at your disposal. You can find an up-to-date overview of the best hosts here: <a class="url" href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/">www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/</a>.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> The wpbeginner site is a good resource. Whenever you have a question about WordPress, you can usually find a solid answer there. They offer clear tutorials, tips, guides, and unbiased reviews. Other useful resources include the following: <a class="url" href="https://neilpatel.com/">https://neilpatel.com/</a>, <a class="url" href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">https://chat.openai.com/chat</a>, <a class="url" href="https://wordpress.org/support/forums">https://wordpress.org/support/forums</a>, <a class="url" href="https://wordpress.org/support/">https://wordpress.org/support/</a>, and <a class="url" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/wpbeginner/">www.facebook.com/groups/wpbeginner/</a>.</p>
<p class="body">During the setup process when you sign up for a hosting service, you’re asked to create a username/password pair for your hosting service account. Then, when you add a new, empty WordPress install to that account, you’ll be asked for a <i class="fm-italics">second</i> username/password pair. Write all four of these terms down on a piece of paper. When you need to go to your hosting account or sign into your WordPress site to work on it, you’ll need these usernames and passwords.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_7">2.2.3 A hosting service checklist</h3>
<p class="body">You want to find a hosting service that provides the following:<a id="idIndexMarker018"/><a id="marker-40"/><a id="idIndexMarker019"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Reliable, continuous uptime</i>—You should expect 99% uptime because if a service causes your site to be unavailable, you can lose part of your audience. People know that there are alternatives to your offerings, and the internet has conditioned most people to have a very quick finger on their mouse button. It takes only a few seconds delay for many internet surfers to fly away elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Fast page loads and caching</i>—Consider that many in your audience have become impatient with any kind of delay, including a site page that loads slowly. So when reviewing a hosting service’s metrics, check their average page load speed. Also look at whether a spike in traffic to the site affects the load speed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Note</span> One important technology that contributes to rapid page display is <i class="fm-italics">caching.</i> To speed up the display of a page, hosting services <i class="fm-italics">cache</i> (store) pages from your site that were previously displayed. When that same page is requested again, the host can just slap that already-rendered, cached page onto the visitor’s screen. This avoids the delay caused by the rendering process. (To display a fresh page, the browser must perform a variety of tasks—fetching images from your WordPress Media Library; looking at any CSS code to see if a font size, for example, differs from what the theme’s CSS style sheet specifies; scanning HTML code to figure out where to position the page elements; and so on. So you’ll want a host that caches its sites’ pages efficiently.) <a id="idIndexMarker020"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Effective security</i>—Redundancy is usually a good thing in security. It’s important that your hosting service offers its own robust security system, and that you also install a sec<a id="idTextAnchor003"/>urity plugin such as Wordfence. Top secret military installations don’t rely on a single fence, nor should you.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">A reliable backup system</i>—Quality hosting services automatically back up your site daily. Again, you’ll want to also install a separate backup plugin. Thus, if your double-fenced security precautions fail, you can still restore your site.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Easily accessed and reliable tech support</i>—Everyone who creates or manages websites is going to need to talk to a hosting service’s tech support now and then. This isn’t a matter of if, but when. So you’ll want to choose a service that offers rapid and accurate response to your phone, email, or chat queries. All three of the WordPress.org recommended hosts mentioned previously provide that kind of tech support. They can be relied on to get you out of difficulty quickly.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Servers located near your target audience</i>—Although the headquarters of a hosting service doesn’t matter, the location of their servers does. Some of the best hosting <a id="idTextAnchor004"/>services advertise a content delivery network (CDN), which just means they offer multiple servers around the world to store your site. Your pages load more quickly if the server hosting your site is located at least on the same continent as your primary audience. Many people who might otherwise join your audience simply won’t tolerate sluggish page-load times. And some in your audience will also have slow internet connections. For them, page-load speed is a major consideration when they decide whether to bookmark your site for future visits—or fly away.<a id="idIndexMarker021"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">To sum up, you’ll likely be well served if you sign up with one of the big three recommended by WordPress.org: SiteGround, Bluehost, or DreamHost. But if you want to explore other options, you can use that checklist given earlier to avoid regret later on.<a id="idIndexMarker022"/><a id="idIndexMarker023"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_8">2.3 Visiting your backend</h2>
<p class="body">In the WordPress backend where you work on your site, there are quite a few different pages, such as a menu-construction page, a Media Library, and an add new plugins page. However, we’ll call them screens rather than pages, to distinguish them from the site’s actual pages as viewed by your audience. The backend is the view of the site that only you, the administrator (or others you give permission to), can get into. Here, you’ll add new pages, perform housekeeping, make improvements, and otherwise build and maintain the site. It’s the engine room, down below what your visitors see. Visitors are kept to the frontend, the public area of the site.<a id="idIndexMarker024"/><a id="idIndexMarker025"/><a id="marker-41"/></p>
<p class="body">The first thing to do after setting up a brand-new, empty WordPress installation on your hosting service is to go visit the backend of your site. Its address is based on what you chose for your site’s URL (domain name) when you signed up with your hosting service. For example, if your domain name is <a class="url" href="https://mysitesname.com">https://mysitesname.com</a>, then your backend address is https://mysitesname.com/wp-admin.</p>
<p class="body">Your backend address is just a modification of the frontend address. You simply append /wp-admin to your domain name. When you first visit the backend, bookmark (or favorite) it in your browser. In addition, when your browser asks if you want to save the username and password, do so to easily go there whenever you want to work on the site. And note that when you want to look at your frontend, just remove the appended /wp-admin part of the address.</p>
<p class="body">In 2018, the WordPress development team added a second editor to WordPress and made it the default. The editor is where you add new content to a site or modify existing content such as text, images, multimedia, hyperlinks, and so on. The new editor is variously called <i class="fm-italics">Gutenberg</i> or the <i class="fm-italics">WordPress block editor</i>.<a id="idIndexMarker026"/><a id="idIndexMarker027"/></p>
<p class="body">So, WordPress developers have two editors they can choose from: the traditional classic editor and Gutenberg. The former somewhat resembles a word processor on steroids, and the latter is like a page builder. Third-party page builders such as Elementor and Divi have become popular WordPress plugins. Page builders can offer functionalities such as drag-and-drop layouts, WYSIWYG dynamic design, and page templates, as well as additional functionality such as tools for fine-tuning the site’s appearance without writing code.<a id="idIndexMarker028"/><a id="idIndexMarker029"/></p>
<p class="body">Gutenberg is designed to build into WordPress what aftermarket page-builder plugins have offered for years. For now, I recommend that you switch to the classic WordPress editor. That way, your results will match what’s shown in this book. However, throughout the book, the way to do things using Gutenberg is also described. The choice is yours. If you want to use the classic editor, see the instructions in the appendix. It’s easy to switch back and forth between classic and Gutenberg with a plugin called the <i class="fm-italics">Classic Editor</i>.<a id="idIndexMarker030"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_9">2.4 Hiding your site while it’s under construction</h2>
<p class="body">You’ll want to wait until your website is polished before making your site public. It’s clearly important that search engines judge the quality of your site after you’ve done your best to make it brilliant. You also don’t want prospective members of your audience to decide whether to visit your site again, or bookmark it, based on a half-finished job.<a id="marker-42"/><a id="idIndexMarker031"/></p>
<p class="body">So, you should block Google and other search systems such as perplexity.ai until you’re ready for your grand opening. To block search systems, go to the backend of your site where, on the left side, you’ll see a black menu, called the <i class="fm-italics">admin menu</i> or <i class="fm-italics">dashboard</i>. Click Settings to open its submenu, and then click Reading, as shown in figure 2.1. Then, next to Search Engine Visibility, select the Discourage Search Engines from Indexing This Site checkbox, and click the Save Changes button.<a id="idIndexMarker032"/><a id="idIndexMarker033"/></p>
<p class="body">The final step in hiding your site is to install a <i class="fm-italics">coming soon</i> plugin. If someone does visit your site, they will only see a message that the site is under construction. <a id="idIndexMarker034"/></p>
<p class="body">However, as the administrator of the site, <i class="fm-italics">you</i> can view the real pages. You need to. When working on your site, you’ll want to take a look <a id="idTextAnchor005"/>at the frontend now and then. The coming soon plugin stores a cookie in your browser to make it clear that you’re allowed to see the pages as they really are.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> Cookies are small pieces of data usually stored in your browser by some sites you visit. The primary purpose is to save you time. If you previously filled in a form or logged in with a password—you won’t need to repeat those actions if the information was stored in a cookie when you visited the site before.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="1043" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH02_F01_Mansfield.png" width="1122"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 2.1 In your Settings &gt; Reading screen, discourage search engines from judging your site-in-progress.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">One good coming soon plugin is Website Builder by SeedProd. To use it, click Plugins &gt; Add New in your WordPress backend dashboard. Then, in the upper-right search field, type <code class="fm-code-in-text">seedprod</code>. Finally, click the Install button, and click Activate.<a id="idIndexMarker035"/><a id="marker-43"/></p>
<p class="body">Some plugins and themes add items to your Dashboard menu. In the menu on the left, click SeedProd &gt; Landing Pages, as shown in figure 2.2.</p>
<p class="body">Some plugins display the Gutenberg-style UI, even if you activate the Classic Editor plugin. SeedProd, for example, is one of them. When you get to the SeedProd Design screen, you can get a taste of how the Gutenberg block editor works in WordPress. SeedProd mimics the block editor. If you wish, add some of SeedProd’s blocks and also replace the nonsense text with your message. Then, your real pages are replaced by this coming soon page, informing visitors that your site is currently being built. Click the Save button. If you see a warning that WordPress isn’t allowing you to save, SeedProd displays information on how to solve that problem. Anytime you want to see how your coming soon page appears to visitors, type or paste your site’s frontend address into a browser that <i class="fm-italics">you didn’t use</i> to set up this plugin.<a id="idIndexMarker036"/></p>
<p class="body">The SeedProd plugin also includes an Under Construction screen that you can use if you’re <i class="fm-italics">updating</i> an existing site. But you should avoid this approach unless the site is in really bad shape. Your site’s visitors expect access. You can lose some of your audience if your site is down, even briefly.<a id="idIndexMarker037"/></p>

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 2.2 Click Landing Pages under SeedProd, and then click the Edit Page button to customize your coming soon page.</p>
</div>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-44"/>Instead, it’s usually best to update your site by working on a copy of it, rather than shutting down the live site. Use the <i class="fm-italics">staging</i> utility found in your hosting service’s cPanel collection of utilities (or you can add a staging plugin to your site)<i class="fm-italics">.</i> When staged, the site is copied, but the live site remains accessible to your visitors. You make your improvements to the copy. Then when you’re finished, the copy replaces the older version and goes live.<a id="idIndexMarker038"/></p>
<p class="body">There is an exception to staging. If your site is badly mangled by a malware attack, for example, and thus there are broken links, missing pages, visible code, blank pages, or whatever, you would be better off just displaying an Under Construction screen with information on when the site will be available again. You don’t want visitors to arrive at a site that’s rife with problems.</p>
<p class="body">An optional step when keeping your site private is to hide individual pages and posts unless you give someone a password to access them. Each page and post in a site has its own, separate permalink URL internet address.</p>
<p class="body">Normally a permalink is constructed by appending the page’s title to the site’s address:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><a class="url" href="https://siteaddress.com">https://siteaddress.com</a>—Site address.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">https://siteaddress.com/about-us—This would be the About Us page’s permalink address. (URL addresses can’t have space characters, so a hyphen is inserted to replace the space in the page title.) In this example, the about-us portion of the address is called a <i class="fm-italics">slug. <a id="idIndexMarker039"/></i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">Given that interior pages have their own URL addresses, it’s possible for someone to arrive at one of these inside pages before you’re ready for your site to be made public. That said, a quality coming soon plugin such as the one from SeedProd by default displays the coming soon screen on all the pages.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_10">2.4.1 Asking AI to leave your site alone</h3>
<p class="body">AI systems “learn” by traversing the internet and memorizing and organizing the content it finds. But if you don’t want AI to use your content, you can request that AI systems don’t harvest the information in your site. And some AIs will comply. The effectiveness of that request will likely depend at least in part on future copyright law.<a id="marker-45"/><a id="idIndexMarker040"/></p>
<p class="body">Let’s say you want to keep all or part of your content off-limits—only available to people who pay you for access to that information—or you don’t want AIs to harvest your content. You can try to prevent AI or search engines from visiting your pages by storing a file titled robots.txt in your site’s root file directory. (That directory is the one named public_html in your site’s database, which is stored on your hosting service’s servers.) If the file is already there, you can modify it. Or you can create a new file by that name. But be sure you know what you’re doing if you mess with your site’s files. You could trash your site. (Before modifying your site’s files, be sure to back up your site first.)</p>
<p class="body">In any case, you can specify in that file what access permissions, if any, you’re granting to AI. To see the specifics of what to type into that file, visit <a class="url" href="https://mng.bz/eyww">https://mng.bz/eyww</a>. And if you need help figuring out how and where to save this file, you can ask your hosting service’s tech support people.<a id="idIndexMarker041"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_11">2.5 Saving your work</h2>
<p class="body">Some applications, such as Microsoft OneNote, automatically save any changes you make. WordPress doesn’t do that. Instead, when you modify content in a page on your site, you must click the Update button (or several synonyms that WordPress displays for that button).<a id="idIndexMarker042"/></p>
<p class="body">Here’s one problem with those synonyms: WordPress isn’t consistent in naming the buttons that save your work. For example, when you first create a new page in WordPress, the button that saves your work is labeled <i class="fm-italics">Publish</i>. Then, that same button’s label changes to <i class="fm-italics">Update</i>. It’s not good UI design to change the name of a button. Beginners are often confused by this. It would be an improvement if all the buttons that save your work were simply all named Save.</p>
<p class="body">WordPress is normally intuitive. The UI is well-designed. But these save buttons are confusing because they have different meanings. It’s just something you have to get used to. For one thing, <i class="fm-italics">publish</i> normally means <i class="fm-italics">make public</i>. In other words, you would think that clicking Publish means that your audience can now see the most recent version of a page you just modified. But that’s not always so. If the page is cached (stored for future display), they won’t necessarily see the new version, particularly if the caching algorithm considers the modification minor.</p>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-46"/>In addition, you might be working on a draft of the page or have specified that this page is to be private. In those cases, the page is stored only to your site’s database, but it’s not made visible to the public.</p>
<p class="body">Making matters worse, this same button that saves your work is labeled in several other ways in different screens in WordPress. When you’re working on the site’s menu screen, it’s named Save Menu. In some other screens, it’s called Save Changes. You’ll also find just plain Save sometimes.</p>
<p class="body">And there’s one more problem. This “save” button appears in various locations on different screens. It’s often on the upper right, sometimes the lower right, and sometimes way down at the bottom of the screen so you have to scroll down to even see it.</p>
<p class="body">Note too that there are several ways you can exit from an unsaved screen: click a different tab in your browser, close the current tab, shut down the browser, or switch to a different application. If you do exit without saving your changes, WordPress usually displays the warning message shown in figure 2.3.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="386" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH02_F03_Mansfield.png" width="823"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 2.3 You’re usually warned like this if you try to go away from a page where you didn’t save modifications you made.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">The key word here is <i class="fm-italics">usually</i>. On a few screens, there’s no warning, and you lose whatever work you did on that screen! So, you’ll want to make a habit of saving modifications by clicking the Save button, or whichever of its various labels might be displayed at the time.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_12">2.6 Ensuring site security</h2>
<p class="body">If you’ve signed up with a quality hosting service, you can be sure that they have established a set of fences between your quivering young website and the menacing spider bots that constantly roam the internet—tirelessly probing, at astonishing speeds, for vulnerabilities. But before you invest time building your site, you’ll want to take two defensive steps of your own: add a security plugin, and add a backup plugin.<a id="idIndexMarker043"/><a id="idIndexMarker044"/><a id="marker-47"/></p>
<p class="body">True, a good host invests a great deal of effort to ensure that its servers are protected. A massive attack would destroy their business. Good hosts also back up your site daily or at a frequency you choose that best matches your situation. But redundancy in these matters is a good thing. Most people turn on Windo<a id="idTextAnchor006"/>ws Defender but also invest in a separate anti-virus application that also helps their machine.</p>
<p class="body">One widely respected WordPress security plugin is Wordfence. It’s a <i class="fm-italics">freemium</i> product—offering both free and paid plans—but the free version is quite effective. Add it to your site in the early days of site building. Here’s how:<a id="idIndexMarker045"/></p>
<ol class="calibre7">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Go to your Plugins &gt; Add New screen.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">In the search field, type <code class="fm-code-in-text">wordfence</code>.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Click the Install button, and then click Activate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="body">Also ensure that your passwords are strong, both the one to the backend of your site and the other password to your hosting service account. Your browser can remember these passwords for you, so there’s no reason not to make them complex and meaningless. Remember that the evil spiders flashing around the internet are tireless. One of their tricks is called a brute-force attack. They can try every word in the English language and every combination of a finite set of digits, until they hit on your password.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_13">2.7 Automating<a id="idTextAnchor007"/> backups</h2>
<p class="body">One of the best backup plugins is UpdraftPlus, which is used in more than 3 million sites. It’s a freemium service, but the free version works very well. Here’s how to install it:<a id="idIndexMarker046"/><a id="idIndexMarker047"/></p>
<ol class="calibre7">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Go to your Plugins &gt; Add New screen.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">In the search field, type <code class="fm-code-in-text">updraftplus</code><i class="fm-italics">.</i></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Click the Install button, and then click Activate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="body">After it’s activated, go to your Settings &gt; UpdraftPlus Backups screen, and click the Settings tab, shown in figure 2.4.</p>
<p class="body">Click the down-arrow next to the Manual setting for Files Backup Schedule. This drops down a list from which you should choose Daily if you’re actively modifying the site or if you have a busy blog frequently adding new posts.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="1014" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH02_F04_Mansfield.png" width="1122"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 2.4 In this settings screen, specify how often to back up your site’s files and database, how many backups to retain, and where to store them.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">Do the same for the Database backup schedule. Also choose 10 or so for the number of backups you want to retain. The 11th backup becomes the first in the stack, and the oldest one, the 10th, is deleted. Finally choose the location where you want your backups stored. Then, be sure to click the Save Changes button.<a id="marker-48"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> While you’re building or actively updating your site, a daily backup ensures that you won’t lose too much of your work. But if you’ve made changes you want to save right away, you can always back up manually: just click the Backup Now button on the main UpdraftPlus settings screen (the Backup/Restore tab). In addition, if you’re not making changes to the site for several weeks, you can reduce the frequency of the automatic backups.</p>
<p class="body">However, if your site does suffer a massive attack or some other catastrophe, and you can’t restore it, there’s still hope. Go to <a class="url" href="https://archive.org/web/">https://archive.org/web/</a>, and paste your site’s frontend address into the search field. You’ll at least be able to copy and paste the text content stored on this archival site, and you can also take screenshots of the images and the page layouts. This will at least make reconstructing your site from scratch much easier. You’ll have the site design, page layouts, and content back.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_14">2.8 Managing site access</h2>
<p class="body">If you want to have others working on your design, contributing to the content, or subscribing to your site, you’ll need to decide how much and what kind of access you want to grant them. Not everyone needs total, administrator-level control over the site. You can provide various degrees of permission, each with its own scope. Essentially, you can specify what a given person can or can’t do in the site. You set these permissions in the Users &gt; Add New screen, shown in figure 2.5.<a id="idIndexMarker048"/><a id="idIndexMarker049"/><a id="marker-49"/><a id="idIndexMarker050"/></p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 2.5 In the Add New User screen, you specify a permission level for someone you’re allowing into the backend.<a id="marker-50"/></p>
</div>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_15">2.8.1 Understanding the various user roles</h3>
<p class="body">There are some default user roles available for your use. The following describes each user role: <a id="idIndexMarker051"/><a id="idIndexMarker052"/><a id="idIndexMarker053"/><a id="idIndexMarker054"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Administrator</i>—People assigned this role have complete control over the site. They can add, delete, or edit any content, anywhere. They can manage other users, change any settings in the site, and install or remove plugins and themes. Their most significant capability is that they can delete, modify, or add other users, including changing their passwords. In other words, administrators can do anything.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Editor</i>—They are able to add, delete, or modify any content in the site, and they can moderate blog posts. They aren’t allowed to install or manipulate themes or plugins, add new users, modify the roles of existing users, or change the site’s settings.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Author</i>—This role represents little risk to the website. Authors can add, delete, or create post tags, or modify their <i class="fm-italics">own</i> posts. They can’t create new categories. They can’t approve or delete other people’s posts. And they can’t do anything else to the site.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Contributor</i>—These people have permissions similar to the author role. However, they can’t delete their published posts. And unlike the author role, they can’t add files to the site, so this prevents them from including pictures in their posts.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Subscriber</i>—Subscribers can modify their profile or change their password. But they can do nothing else.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">A new user gets an email from you (if you choose that option when setting them up). It tells them their username and displays a link that allows them to create a password.</p>
<p class="body">In addition to these default user roles, as the administrator, you can define custom roles. This way, if one of the default roles isn’t what you’re after, you can create a new role that includes whatever set of permissions you do want to grant. It’s considered best practice to have only one, or at the most two, administrator users. Others should have less control over the site.</p>
<p class="body">Plugins and themes can also add roles in addition to the WordPress default roles. For example, the WooCommerce plugin adds shop manager and customer roles that define how a user can interact with its e-commerce features.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_16">2.8.2 Monetizing via subscriptions</h3>
<p class="body">One good way to generate income from your site is to provide content that visitors must pay for, and you can wall off the entire site or only part of it. People rarely object to this kind of monetization because it’s voluntary and unobtrusive.<a id="idIndexMarker055"/><a id="idIndexMarker056"/><a id="idIndexMarker057"/><a id="idIndexMarker058"/><a id="marker-51"/><a id="idIndexMarker059"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> The subscriber role is most often used in sites that are based on a membership, subscription, or online store model. Users must register and pay to access some or all of the site’s content. Another scenario for the subscriber role is to let subscribers register and comment on posts but block them from creating or publishing other content.</p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">
<p class="fm-sidebar-title">How to monetize</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">If you want to monetize your site’s content, here are some suggestions that employ the subscriber user role:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">

<p class="list-s">Online courses in which people pay either to view the content or to join online classes</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet1">

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_17">2.8.3 Password-protecting pages</h3>
<p class="body">Here’s another way to control access to the pages or blog posts in the frontend of your site. Your visitors can be divided into those with passwords to certain pages and those who can’t view those pages. You can wall off individual pages and posts by marking them as password-protected. Here’s how:<a id="idIndexMarker060"/><a id="idIndexMarker061"/><a id="idIndexMarker062"/><a id="idIndexMarker063"/><a id="idIndexMarker064"/></p>
