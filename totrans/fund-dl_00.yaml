- en: With the reinvigoration of neural networks in the 2000s, deep learning has become
    an extremely active area of research that is paving the way for modern machine
    learning. This book uses exposition and examples to help you understand major
    concepts in this complicated field. Large companies such as Google, Microsoft,
    and Facebook have taken notice and are actively growing in-house deep learning
    teams. For the rest of us, deep learning is still a pretty complex and difficult
    subject to grasp. Research papers are filled to the brim with jargon, and scattered
    online tutorials do little to help build a strong intuition for why and how deep
    learning practitioners approach problems. Our goal is to bridge this gap.

- en: In this second edition, we provide more rigorous background sections in mathematics
    with the aim of better equipping you for the material in the rest of the book.
    In addition, we have updated chapters in sequence analysis, computer vision, and
    reinforcement learning with deep dives into the latest advancements in the fields.
    And finally, we have added new chapters in the fields of generative modeling and
    interpretability to provide you with a broader view of the field of deep learning.
    We hope that these updates inspire you to practice deep learning on their own
    and apply their learnings to solve meaningful problems in the real world.

- en: This book is aimed at an audience with a basic operating understanding of calculus
    and Python programming. In this latest edition, we provide extensive mathematical
    background chapters, specifically in linear algebra and probability, to prepare
    you for the material that lies ahead.

- en: By the end of the book, we hope you will be left with an intuition for how to
    approach problems using deep learning, the historical context for modern deep
    learning approaches, and a familiarity with implementing deep learning algorithms
    using the PyTorch open source library.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first chapters of this book are dedicated to developing mathematical maturity
    via deep dives into linear algebra and probability, which are deeply embedded
    in the field of deep learning. The next several chapters discuss the structure
    of feed-forward neural networks, how to implement them in code, and how to train
    and evaluate them on real-world datasets. The rest of the book is dedicated to
    specific applications of deep learning and understanding the intuition behind
    the specialized learning techniques and neural network architectures developed
    for those applications. Although we cover advanced research in these latter sections,
    we hope to provide a breakdown of these techniques that is derived from first
    principles and digestible.

    experience. No endeavor like this can be achieved by one person alone. First,
    I would like to thank the PyTorch community and its 2,100+ contributors for continuing
    to grow and improve PyTorch and its deep learning capabilities. It is because
    of you that we can demonstrate the concepts described in this book.

    to my wife, Emily, who has always supported my dreams throughout life. While I
    diligently wrote code, she cared for our newborn through sleepless nights while
