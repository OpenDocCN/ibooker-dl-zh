<blockquote data-type="epigraph" epub:type="epigraph">
<p>The winds and the waves are always on the side of the ablest navigators.</p>

<p data-type="attribution">Edward Gibbon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been writing code for a very long time now—longer than I care to admit—and I’ve seen the winds and waves of change that have swept across the software development industry multiple times (and written about or trained on many of them). From the internet to CI/CD to containers to cloud, the paradigm shifts have upended the old ways of doing things, and spawned innovation, incredible tools, and turnarounds in our approaches to creating software. And, broadly, those shifts have also generated uncertainty and confusion as individuals tried to understand them and figure out how to adapt and apply their skills..</p>

<p>Now we have generative AI, arguably the biggest wave of change we have encountered in tech, especially for those developing software. Just like the others, it is inspiring massive innovation and driving massive changes. But in some respects, it resembles more of a tsunami where new tools, new models, and new capabilities exhibit tremendous power, all while coders are being swept along and trying to keep our collective heads above water.</p>

<p>This book is my attempt to help you surf the wave—at least as far as using the AI powerhouse that is GitHub Copilot. I won’t claim it will answer all your questions, but hopefully it will help you get to a very good comfort level with the tool, let you understand its capabilities (from basic to advanced topics), and inspire you to make your coding tasks simpler and easier than they’ve ever been before.</p>

<p>I’ve been using Copilot in multiple ways for several years: in personal projects, as a former DevOps director piloting it in a corporate R&amp;D organization, as a trainer on Copilot for multiple vendors, as a skeptic, and as an enthusiast. Regarding those last two roles, I wasn’t as impressed with Copilot in its early days as I was with other tools. But over the course of writing this book, developing courses on it, and watching it evolve, it’s become one of the primary tools I use on a regular basis when working in my integrated development environment (IDE) or in GitHub. Copilot has come a long way, even in the last few months. There’s been some impressive progress with features and functionality. I’ve tried to capture as many of those as I could in the book.</p>

<p>One of my goals in writing these chapters is to share the benefits and the challenges of using Copilot, and try to help you avoid surprises. So, before you jump in, here’s a few things to be aware of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For the last year or so, GitHub Copilot has changed the appearance and location of at least one dialog or control with nearly every release. I’ve done my best to update screenshots and descriptions as they are at the time of writing. But it’s certain that some will have been moved, changed in appearance, etc. by the time you are reading this. </li>
	<li>Copilot is now releasing new features on a fairly regular basis. So, over time there will be new features that are not represented in the book. Likewise, some functionality in Copilot is noted as being in <em>preview</em> or <em>experimental</em> as of the time of writing. Those may have been moved to production by the time you read this or may have been removed if they didn’t make the cut.</li>
	<li>Copilot runs in many different environments, including multiple IDEs. In each IDE, there can be (and are) differences in integration, appearance, and even functionality. GitHub has historically prioritized Visual Studio Code and the environments that use the same interface (like GitHub Codespaces) to roll out new features and to contain the superset of functionality. For that reason, all screenshots and examples in the book are done with either VS Code or in a Codespace.</li>
	<li>For those of you using non-VS Code IDEs, some features or functions may have not been implemented by GitHub in that environment. Please consult the Copilot and/or IDE <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot">documentation</a> for the latest information.</li>
	<li>Similarly, IDEs that integrate with Copilot can usually be run on multiple platforms including Windows, Mac, and Linux. Since it’s not practical to cover all the variations in the book, the examples were done on a Mac. So the windows and controls shown may reflect the Mac style. Also keyboard shortcuts will differ among the platforms. To avoid having to list all keyboard shortcuts each time we reference them, we’ve adopted <em>Meta</em> as a notation that means to insert the appropriate shortcut for your platform.</li>
</ul>
	  
	  <p>All of these things apply across the entire structure of the book, which was written to take you from the <em>What is it</em> basics to the advanced <em>Here’s how you go beyond the core functionality</em>. Most of the chapters can be read standalone, and you should feel free to skip between chapters as your needs and comfort level dictate.</p>
	  
	  <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="The Structure of This Book"><div class="sect1" id="id368">
	    <h1>The Structure of This Book</h1>
	    
	    <p>Since you’re reading this book, I imagine you’re interested in GitHub Copilot as a potential AI coding assistant or at least looking to learn more about how it and similar coding assistants can be used to help you work more quickly and efficiently.</p>
	    
	    <p>To help with that, an outline of the book’s structure follows.</p>
	    
	    <p>Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch01.html#ch01">1</a>, <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch02.html#ch02">2</a>, and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch03.html#ch03">3</a> guide you through the foundations you need to understand what Copilot is and how to interact with it in its two main modes—code completion and the chat (conversational) interface.</p>
	    
	    <p><a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a> explores advanced ways of interacting with Copilot to do more autonomous editing as well as using Agent mode to drive changes from prompt to finish automatically. This chapter also explores the unique interface of Copilot Vision as well as debugging with Copilot.</p>
	    
	    <p>Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch05.html#ch05">5</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch06.html#ch06">6</a> show you how you can leverage Copilot to create rich sets of tests and multiple kinds of documentation to simplify those tasks and give you more time to focus on other coding tasks.</p>
	    
	    <p><a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a> focuses on how you can improve the timeliness and relevance of results from Copilot.</p>
	    
	    <p><a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a> explores how you can use Copilot to handle a number of less common but useful tasks.</p>
	    
	    <p><a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9</a> explores Copilot’s chat interface in GitHub and how Copilot can help you understand more about your projects and simplify working with GitHub Issues and pull requests.</p>
	    
	    <p>Finally, <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch10">Chapter 10</a> provides information on enhancing Copilot’s functionality through the integration of GitHub Extensions and shows how to build your own.</p>
	    
	    <p>As you start reading, you don’t have to know anything about Copilot to use this book. But I do assume you’re familiar with basic coding skills and have a basic working knowledge of Git and GitHub. The next section explains a bit more about the types of readers who may benefit from the book.</p>
      </div></section>
	  
	  <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Intended Audience"><div class="sect1" id="intended_audience">
	    <h1>Intended Audience</h1>
	    
	    <p>This book is for anyone who is trying to learn more about using AI assistants for developing software. Yes, it’s specifically about GitHub Copilot, but many of the examples and flows have parallels in other AI coding tools and environments. To get the most out of this book, you should already have experience coding in an IDE and have a basic knowledge of GitHub. To be clear, this book is not going to teach you how to code, how to use an IDE, or how to use GitHub. But it will help you multiply your productivity in all of those areas through using Copilot. Whether you are a software developer, quality engineer, SRE, or someone who is just looking to understand how an AI assistant like Copilot can benefit them, I believe you’ll find meaningful information and insights.</p>
	    
	    <p>Here are some audiences that I had in mind while writing the book and that I think can benefit from it:</p>
	    
	    <ul>
	      <li>Those who are new (or newish) to AI coding assistants and looking to understand what they are all about and how to best make use of them</li>
	      <li>Those who already understand the concepts and flow of using AI coding assistants and want to understand what GitHub Copilot has to offer</li>
	      <li>Those who want to understand and evaluate GitHub Copilot as a possible tool to use on a wider scale in their organization or business</li>
	      <li>Those who already have some experience with GitHub Copilot and want to take full advantage of its features and functionality</li>
	      <li>Those who are looking to understand how to compensate for some of GitHub Copilot’s shortcomings</li>
	      <li>Those who want to understand the new features of Copilot, such as Agent mode</li>
	      <li>Those who want to create their own GitHub Copilot extensions</li>
	      <li>Those who work with GitHub and want to take advantage of the Copilot integration there</li>
        </ul>
	    
	    <p>If one of these fits your use case, I hope the book will provide you with the value you’re looking for. If you read it and have the opportunity, feedback is always welcome through reviews or interactions at future conferences or training venues. Info about how to ride the wave of Generative AI in coding begins in Chapter 1. Happy surfing!</p>

	    <h1 class="less_space">Acknowledgments</h1>
	    
	    <p><em>Learning GitHub Copilot</em> marks my fourth published book, alongside many technical guides, reports, articles, and other documents I’ve written over the years. Getting from a proposal to a finished product is an incredible investment of time and energy not only from the author, but from a team of people to bring things to production. I am incredibly grateful to the following group of people who contributed their time and energy to bring this project to the point where you can read it and hopefully get value from it.</p>
	    
	    <p>First, many thanks to John Devins, my acquisitions editor at O’Reilly who believed in, and advocated for, this book—as he did on my behalf for so many other projects. John, I hope you’re enjoying a well-deserved retirement! And thanks to Louise Corrigan for picking up from John to continue the effort. Over my time working with O’Reilly, I have truly come to respect and appreciate the role of acquisition editors to support meaningful projects and to provide quality training opportunities and find new ways to bridge learning gaps. Their roles are most often behind the scenes, but their efforts are core to much of the learning that I and other content creators get to bring to the attendees of O’Reilly Learning.</p>
	    
	    <p>When I first started writing this book, I specifically asked to work again with Michele Cronin as the development editor for the project. Michele was also the development editor on <em>Learning GitHub Actions</em>, so I knew she was the right person to make this project complete, polished, and successful. Behind the scenes, Michele has put in many hours keeping the project (and me) on track, helping resolve any potential roadblocks, lining up reviewers and consolidating feedback, and always being available for any questions. As well, she has provided sage advice on how to navigate any and all challenges that have come up along the way. She has been an optimistic and supportive guide throughout the process, and I am very much appreciative of all that she has done and the experience and guidance she provided that made this book <span class="keep-together">possible</span>.</p>
	    
	    <p>There are numerous other people at O’Reilly that have had a hand in the process that I want to also call out. Sharon Wilkey and Jonathon Owen have been exceptional in proofreading and clarifying the content to make it clear and readable. Kate Dullea has helped keep me straight on the images and make sure they are usable and legible. And thanks to Susan Thompson for the cool cover picture and David Futato for the interior design.</p>
	    
	    <p>Many noted experts from GitHub and other areas contributed their time and resources as reviewers for some or all of the book content. Without a doubt, the book is much better for their efforts. Many thanks to Andrew Stellman, Steffen Bjerkenås, Chhaya Methani, Balaji Dhamodharan, Aditya Goel, Sundeep Katta, Jess Males, and Tom Taulli for providing their feedback, impressions, and suggestions. I feel very <span class="keep-together">fortunate</span> and appreciative that these individuals were willing to take time from their busy schedules and provide their feedback, suggestions, and thoughts to make things better for the readers. The book benefitted greatly from their collective technical backgrounds and collective eye for detail. Additional thanks to Andrew Stellman for writing the foreword for the book, which I hope you can find a few minutes to read.</p>
	    
	    <p>I would be remiss not to give a shout-out here to Jay Zimmerman, director of the No Fluff Just Stuff (NFJS) conferences, and Todd Lewis, chairman of the All Things Open (ATO) organization, for providing me with opportunities to speak and present at their respective conferences over the years. The material in this book is better because of the multiple presentations I’ve done on related topics in virtual workshops and conferences for NFJS and ATO. If you ever have a chance to attend one of these conferences or a meetup or virtual event sponsored by these organizations, I encourage you to do so.</p>
	    
	    <p>Thanks also to my colleague and friend, Bob Pacheco, for regularly engaging in technical and non-technical discussions that helped to provoke perspective and lighten the mood when needed.</p>
	    
	    <p>Most importantly, I want to thank my wife, Anne-Marie, for being my supportive soulmate, forever friend, and partner in life. Through her and our kids, Walker, Chase, Tanner, and Katie, I am constantly reminded that those closest to us and that share our daily world are what make each day worth living and each meaningful task worth doing, despite whatever else is going on.</p>
	    
	    <p>Finally, thanks to you, the reader, for getting this book and reading it. I sincerely hope that you will find it useful and something that helps you achieve the goals that you’re looking for as you start or continue your journey with GitHub Copilot. Feel free to reach out on social media or catch me at a conference or event sometime to discuss AI, Copilot, or just chat.</p>
