<h1><span class="label">Chapter 6. </span>Mobilize Your Strategy</h1>

<p>At this point, you should have developed a strategy for your AI
initiatives that can be communicated effectively. Now your organization
needs to execute it. Getting people to take action can be
challenging, especially in mature companies. These companies are
optimized for their markets and struggle with adopting disruptive
innovations like AI. Fortunately, Geoffrey Moore’s Zone
to Win framework, described in his book by the same name (Diversion Books), offers guidance. Over the past decade, I have
adapted this framework for AI initiatives. It’s allowed my leadership
team to execute with consistency. In this section, I provide you
with a step-by-step guide (with examples) for applying this
framework.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="The Four Zones"><div class="sect1" id="id79">
<h1>The Four Zones</h1>
<p>The zone to win framework separates business activities into four
zones:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Performance zone</dt><dd><p>This zone represents your core
business that generates consistent revenue and profit. This zone focuses
on meeting financial targets and maintaining operational excellence.
Products and services in this zone are typically mature and
well-established.</p></dd>
<dt>Productivity zone</dt><dd><p>This zone focuses on
improving efficiency and effectiveness across the organization. AI
initiatives naturally fit here. They can go beyond engineering and into
HR, sales, and finance.</p></dd>
<dt>Incubation zone</dt><dd><p>The incubation zone is for
testing new ideas. It won’t affect your core business right away. This
is a safe space to develop and test new business models, especially
those using generative AI.</p></dd>
<dt>Transformation zone</dt><dd><p>The transformation zone
acts as a bridge between the incubation and performance zones. This zone
integrates your vetted AI initiatives into your core business.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>For many AI initiatives, the incubation zone is the most critical
starting point.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Navigating the AI Implementation Challenge"><div class="sect1" id="id80">
<h1>Navigating the AI Implementation Challenge</h1>
<p>Implementing AI in your business poses a dilemma. You want to be bold
with AI, but can’t risk derailing your core operations.</p>
<p>When you redirect resources from established, profitable areas, you
often face internal resistance. This can come from various sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales teams worry about meeting targets.</li>
<li>Customers and partners prefer the status quo.</li>
<li>Operational teams worry about disruptions to their workflows.</li>
</ul>

<p>This pushback is a natural part of the process. The key is learning
how to navigate this tension effectively. Let’s continue our ACME
E-Commerce case study to illustrate how to apply the zone to win
framework.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Step 1: Clearly Define Your AI Incubation Zone"><div class="sect1" id="id81">
<h1>Step 1: Clearly Define Your AI Incubation Zone</h1>
<dl>
<dt>Draw a hard line</dt><dd>Keep AI projects separate from
core operations when necessary to avoid disrupting what’s already
working.</dd>
<dt>Lock in resources</dt><dd>Assign dedicated talent and
budget to your AI initiatives: don’t let them compete with the core for
scraps.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="pagebreak-before">ACME’s CTO oversees four teams that are responsible for different
parts of the product, as illustrated in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig06in01">Figure 6-1</a>.</p>
<figure><div id="fig06in01" class="figure"><img src="assets/aete_06in01.png" alt="" width="1002" height="327"/><h6><span class="label">Figure 6-1. </span>ACME’s product teams</h6></div></figure>
<p>It might seem like a good idea to pull members from the AI SEO team
into the website builder team, but that’s a critical mistake (<a data-type="xref" href="#fig06in02">Figure 6-2</a>). Those four
teams are laser-focused on ACME’s current product, driving the core
revenue that keeps the business afloat. Disrupting that balance could
jeopardize your primary source of revenue.</p>

<figure><div id="fig06in02" class="figure"><img src="assets/aete_06in02.png" alt="" width="1002" height="523"/><h6><span class="label">Figure 6-2. </span>A faulty team structure</h6></div></figure>

<p>Don’t put the new team directly into the existing org chart. Instead, ACME needs to create a completely separate team dedicated to AI SEO product development (<a data-type="xref" href="#fig06in03">Figure 6-3</a>). Keep them isolated from the existing teams to avoid conflicts and distractions. Once the AI SEO technology is fully matured, you can integrate it back into the core product without disrupting current operations.</p>

<figure><div id="fig06in03" class="figure"><img src="assets/aete_06in03.png" alt="" width="1242" height="327"/><h6><span class="label">Figure 6-3. </span>Better team structure</h6></div></figure>

<p>Separating the AI SEO team gives it room to succeed.</p>

<p>Appointing a temporary GM is the smart move to lead an incubation
zone initiative like this. The ideal candidate is a high-level manager
from Product or Tech—someone with a strong reputation in the
organization that the CTO trusts and an intrapreneurial <span class="keep-together">mindset</span>.</p>

<p>Their job? Keep the focus on the big picture and serve as the key
liaison with other parts of the business, while leaving the day-to-day
implementation to the team.</p>
<p>The GM’s main responsibility is to ensure the team has everything
they need to win—whether that’s talent, access to go-to-market
strategies, budget, tools, or infrastructure.</p>

<p>Finally, the AI SEO initiative needs its own dedicated line item in the operating budget. No blending with other projects.</p>
<p>Keep the budget separate, like the team. This prevents internal
competition for resources and minimizes conflict with other
initiatives.</p>
<p>For ACME, we’ve allocated $2M from the operating budget and
dedicated 10 people, including the GM, to the AI SEO initiative (see <a data-type="xref" href="#fig06in04">Figure 6-4</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>1 product manager</li>
<li>1 designer</li>
<li>4 software engineers</li>
<li>3 AI engineers</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case study, we’ve outlined ACME’s plan to develop an AI-driven
SEO product. Just like the website builder, the goal is
clear: it must be user-friendly and require minimal technical expertise,
making it accessible to nontechnical users. Simplicity is key to
adoption and success.</p>

<h2>Remember: You’re Starting with a Blank Slate</h2>

<p>It’s a good idea to focus on a small number of KPIs for the
initaitve.</p>
<p>In ACME’s case, they need to first focus on getting the product in
front of users and getting feedback on what they actually want.</p>
<p>Good high-level KPIs for the AI SEO initiative
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of users who sign up for the first version of the
product</li>
<li>Number of users who provide feedback on the product</li>
<li>Number of users who give up on the product</li>
</ul>
<p>These all focus on time to value and getting user engagement and
feedback.</p>
<p>They correspond to the lower-left quadrant of the zone to win
framework, which can be seen in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig0605">Figure 6-5</a>.</p>

<h2>There Must Be a Clear Timeline for Exit</h2>

<p>The exit point is when you decide whether to double down on the
initiative or shut it down entirely.</p>
<p>The timeline for this initiative is set at one year. This is a moving target: if the initiative isn’t meeting its KPIs,
adjustments will be made based on feedback and progress.</p>
<p>Each development milestone should take two to four months to complete—an
ideal pace for a small team to show progress and gather user
feedback.</p>
<p>Paired with high-level initiative KPIs, this is where
milestone-specific KPIs become powerful in driving focus and
course-correcting as needed.</p>

<p>At ACME, KPIs are published in a shared Google Sheet, accessible to
the steering committee and executive team for transparency. As the initiative progresses, the team decides to roll out more

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Sharing Progress with Other Stakeholders Is Crucial"><div class="sect2" id="id92">
<h2>Sharing Progress with Other Stakeholders Is Crucial</h2>
<p>Incubation zone initiatives are rarely a straight path. You need to
stay agile, responding to market shifts and unexpected obstacles.</p>
<p>Other teams across the company will be curious about the work
happening in the incubation zone. Establish a regular cadence to provide
updates on the initiative’s progress and health.</p>
<p>Some effective forums for this, depending on your organization,
include:</p>

<ul>
 <li><p>Company All Hands meetings</p></li>
 <li><p>Monthly or quarterly business reviews</p></li>
 <li><p>Customer advisory boards</p></li>
 <li><p>Sales and Business Development team
meetings</p></li>
</ul> 

<p>In ACME’s case, the GM of AI SEO uses a single slide to present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top-line adoption and feature usage metrics, showing how they’ve
trended over time</li>
<li>Customer quotes highlighting real-world product usage</li>
<li>A high-level overview of the development roadmap and key discoveries
along the way</li>
</ul>
<p>These elements help keep the initiative top of mind across the
company and boost the chances of long-term success.</p>

<p>A disciplined approach is crucial for managing higher-risk AI
projects and driving them to success. This framework isn’t
one-size-fits-all—it may not be right for every company or every AI
stage.</p>
<p>But if you’re ready to make a bold AI move, this is where you start
to stack the odds in your favor. Ultimately, success is defined by
revenue growth. Once your incubation zone initiative starts generating
revenue, it’s time to shift how it’s measured and integrate it back into
your core operations.</p>
