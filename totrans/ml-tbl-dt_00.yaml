- en: This opening section of the book aims to provide you with a solid foundation
    for understanding how to work with tabular data. The chapters in this section
    explore the unique characteristics of tabular data, the different modeling approaches
    (machine learning vs. deep learning), and the best practices for exploratory data
    analysis and preparation. By reading these chapters, you will acquire a good understanding
    of the peculiarities of working with tabular data. You will be prepared to tackle
    more advanced techniques in the following sections.

- en: Chapter 1 introduces tabular data. The chapter explains what tabular data is,
    why it’s important, and how it differs from other kinds of data, such as images,
    audio, and text. We also introduce machine learning and deep learning concepts,
    and we try to unravel the controversy about using deep learning methodologies
    on tabular data. The chapter concludes by reviewing the unique characteristics
    of tabular data, which require a specific and distinct approach to analysis and
    modeling.

    potential problems and remedies to common problems with real-world data. We offer
    guidance on how to find tabular data in online and offline sources, especially
    inside business organizations. This chapter also presents a complete demonstration
    of how to perform an effective exploratory data analysis.

    based on three key criteria—simplicity, transparency, and efficacy—highlighting
    the strong and weak points of each one. We also introduce the Airbnb datasets
    that we will use throughout the book.
