<section data-pdf-bookmark="Deploying to Virtual Machines" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="id207">&#13;
<h2>Deploying to Virtual Machines</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="deployment of AI services" data-secondary="options" data-tertiary="deploying to virtual machines" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc2"/>If you plan to use your own on-premises servers or prefer to deploy your services on the same hardware hosting your other applications for high isolation and security, you can deploy your GenAI service to a VM.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A VM is a software emulation of a physical computer running an operating system (OS) and applications.&#13;
It’s no different from a physical computer like a laptop, smartphone, or server.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The VM’s <em>host</em> system provides resources such as CPU, memory, and storage, while a software layer called the <em>hypervisor</em> manages the VM and allocates resources from the host to the VM.&#13;
The resources that the hypervisor allocates to the VM is the <em>virtual hardware</em> that its OS and applications run on.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The VM could run directly on host’s hardware (bare metal) or on a conventional operating system (i.e., be hosted).&#13;
As a result, the OS installed within the VM is then referred to as the <em>guest OS</em>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#deployment_vm_architecture">Figure 12-1</a> shows the virtualization technology system architecture.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="deployment_vm_architecture">&#13;
<img alt="bgai 1201" src="assets/bgai_1201.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 12-1. </span>Virtualization system architecture</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Cloud providers or your own data center can consist of several physical servers, each hosting multiple VMs with their own guest OS and hosted applications.&#13;
For cost-effective resource sharing, these VMs may share the same mounted physical storage drive even though they’re contained within fully isolated environments, as you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#deployment_vm_data_center">Figure 12-2</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="deployment_vm_data_center">&#13;
<img alt="bgai 1202" src="assets/bgai_1202.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 12-2. </span>Hosted VMs in a data center</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The benefit of using a VM is that you have direct access to the guest OS, virtual hardware resources, and GPU drivers.&#13;
If there are any issues with deployment, you can connect to the VM via the <em>Secure Shell Transfer</em> (SHH) protocol to inspect application logs, set up application environment, and debug production issues.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Deploying your services to VMs will be as straightforward as cloning your code repository to the VM and then installing the required dependencies, packages, and drivers to successfully start up your application.&#13;
However, the recommended way to do this is to use a containerization platform such as Docker running on the VM to enable continuous deployments and other benefits.&#13;
You should also ensure you size your VM resources appropriately so that your services aren’t starved for CPU/GPU cores, memory, or disk storage.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>With on-premises VMs, you can save on-cloud hosting or server rental costs and can fully secure your application environments to a handful of users, isolated from the public internet.&#13;
These benefits are also achievable with cloud VMs but require &#13;
<span class="keep-together">additional</span> networking and resource configuration to set up.&#13;
In addition, you can have access to GPU hardware and configure drivers for your application requirements.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Bear in mind that using the VM deployment pattern may not be easily scalable and requires significant effort to maintain.&#13;
Additionally, VM servers normally run 24/7 incurring constant running costs, unless you automate their startup and shutdown based on your needs.&#13;
You’ll be responsible for applying security patches, OS updates, and package upgrades alongside any networking configurations.&#13;
With direct access to hardware resources, you’ll also have more decisions to make that can slow you down, leading to decision fatigue.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>My advice is to deploy to a VM if you don’t plan to scale your services anytime soon or need to maintain low server costs and a secure isolated application environment for a handful of users.&#13;
In addition, make sure you’ve planned sufficient time for deployment, networking, and configuration of your VMs.<a data-startref="ix_ch12-asciidoc2" data-type="indexterm" id="id1274"/></p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Deploying to Serverless Functions" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="id208">&#13;
<h2>Deploying to Serverless Functions</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="deployment of AI services" data-secondary="options" data-tertiary="deploying to serverless functions" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc3"/><a data-primary="serverless deployments" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc4"/>Aside from VMs, you can also deploy your services on cloud functions that cloud providers supply as <em>serverless</em> systems.&#13;
In serverless computing, your code is executed in response to events such as database changes, updates to blobs in a storage, HTTP requests, or messages added to a queue.&#13;
This means you pay only for the requests or compute resources your services use, rather than for an entire server as with a continuously running VM.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Serverless deployments are often useful when:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>You want to have event-driven systems instead of a running VM, which might be on 24/7</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>You want to deploy your API services using a serverless architecture that’s highly cost-efficient</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Your services are to perform batch processing jobs</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>You need workflow automation</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The term <em>serverless</em> doesn’t mean that cloud functions don’t require hardware resources to execute but rather that the management of these resources is handled by the cloud provider.&#13;
This allows you to focus on writing application code without worrying about server and OS-level details.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Cloud providers instantiate compute resources to meet the demand of their customers.&#13;
Often, there is a surge in demand, requiring them to create additional resources in advance to handle the demand spike.&#13;
However, once the demand drops, excess unallocated compute resources remain that must be either shut down or shared among other customers.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Removing and creating resources is an intensive compute operation to perform. At scale, these operations carry significant costs for cloud providers. Therefore, cloud providers prefer to keep these resources running as much as possible and distribute them among existing customers to maximize billing.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To encourage customers to use these excess compute, they’ve built cloud function services that you can leverage to run your backend services on excess (i.e., serverless) compute.&#13;
Luckily, there are packages such as Magnum that allow you to package &#13;
<span class="keep-together">FastAPI</span> services on AWS cloud functions.&#13;
You will soon see that FastAPI services can also be deployed as Azure cloud functions.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>What you need to bear in mind is that these functions are allocated only a small amount of resources and have a short timeout.&#13;
However, you can request longer timeouts and compute resources to be allocated, but it may take longer to receive these allocations, leading to higher latencies for your users.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>If your business logic consumes a lot of resources or requires longer than a handful of minutes to execute, cloud functions may not be a suitable deployment option for you.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>However, you can split your FastAPI services across multiple functions, with each function handling a single exposed endpoint.&#13;
This way, you can deploy parts of your service as cloud functions, reducing the portion of the FastAPI service that needs to be deployed using other methods.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The main advantage of using serverless functions for deploying your services is their scalability.&#13;
You can scale your applications as needed and pay only a fraction of the cost compared to reserving dedicated VM resources.&#13;
Cloud providers typically charge based on the number of function executions and runtime, often with generous monthly quotas.&#13;
This means that if your functions run quickly and you have a moderate number of concurrent users, you might be able to host all your services for free.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Furthermore, cloud providers also supply function runtimes that you can install locally for local testing and development so that you can significantly shorten development iterations.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Each cloud provider has their own approach to deploying serverless functions.&#13;
Often, you require an entry script such as <em>main.py</em> that can import dependencies from other modules as needed.&#13;
Alongside the entry point script, you’ll need to upload a function host JSON configuration file alongside <em>requirements.txt</em> for required dependencies to be installed on deployment on a Python runtime.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can then deploy functions by uploading all the required files as a zipped directory or using CI/CD pipelines that authenticate with the provider and execute the deployment commands within your cloud project.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As an example, let’s try to deploy a bare-bones FastAPI app that returns LLM responses. The structure of the project will be as follows:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">project/&#13;
│&#13;
├── host.json&#13;
├── main.py&#13;
├── app.py&#13;
└── requirements.txt</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can then package a FastAPI app as an <a href="https://oreil.ly/ZaOuF">Azure serverless function</a> by following the upcoming code examples.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You will need to install the <code>azure-functions</code> package to run Azure’s serverless function runtime for local development and testing:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting">$<code class="w"> </code>pip<code class="w"> </code>install<code class="w"> </code>azure-functions<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Then, create <em>host.json</em> by following <a data-type="xref" href="#deployment_function_azure_host">Example 12-1</a>.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="example" id="deployment_function_azure_host">&#13;
<h5><span class="label">Example 12-1. </span>Azure Functions host configurations (host.json)</h5>&#13;

<code class="p">}</code><code class="w"/></pre></div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Afterward, implement your GenAI service with the FastAPI service as usual by following <a data-type="xref" href="#deployment_function_azure_app">Example 12-2</a>.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="example" id="deployment_function_azure_app">&#13;
<h5><span class="label">Example 12-2. </span>Simple FastAPI application serving LLM responses</h5>&#13;

<code class="o">...</code></pre></div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Finally, wrap your FastAPI <code>app</code> within <code>func.AsgiFunctionApp</code> for the Azure serverless function runtime to hook into it, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#deployment_function_azure_function">Example 12-3</a>.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="example" id="deployment_function_azure_function">&#13;
<h5><span class="label">Example 12-3. </span>Deploying a FastAPI service with Azure Functions</h5>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="python" data-type="programlisting"><code class="c1"># function.py</code>&#13;
&#13;
<code class="kn">import</code> <code class="nn">azure.functions</code> <code class="k">as</code> <code class="nn">func</code>&#13;

<code class="p">)</code></pre></div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can then start the function app by running the <code>func start</code> command, which should be available as a CLI command once you install the <code>azure-functions</code> &#13;
<span class="keep-together">package:</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting">$<code class="w"> </code>func<code class="w"> </code>start<code class="w"/>&#13;
&#13;
&gt;&gt;<code class="w"> </code>Found<code class="w"> </code>the<code class="w"> </code>following<code class="w"> </code>functions:<code class="w"/>&#13;

&#13;
&gt;&gt;<code class="w"> </code>Job<code class="w"> </code>host<code class="w"> </code>started<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can then try URLs corresponding to the handlers in the app by sending HTTP requests to both simple and the parameterized paths:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">http://localhost:7071/generate/text&#13;
http://localhost:7071/&lt;other-paths&gt;</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Once ready, you can then deploy your FastAPI wrapped serverless function to the Azure cloud and then run the following command:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">$ func azure functionapp publish &lt;FunctionAppName&gt;</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The <code>publish</code> command will then publish the project files from the project directory to <code>&lt;FunctionAppName&gt;</code> as a ZIP deployment package.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>After deployment, you can then test different paths on the deployed URL:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">http://&lt;FunctionAppName&gt;.azurewebsites.net/generate/text&#13;
http://&lt;FunctionAppName&gt;.azurewebsites.net/&lt;other-paths&gt;</pre>&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>Your chosen cloud provider may not support serving a FastAPI server within its function runtime.&#13;
If that’s the case, you may want to seek alternative deployment options.&#13;
Otherwise, you’ll need to migrate the logic of your endpoints to the supported web framework of the function runtime and create separate functions for each endpoint.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As you see, deploying your FastAPI service as cloud functions is straightforward and allows you to delegate the management and scaling of your services to cloud &#13;
<span class="keep-together">providers.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Bear in mind that if you decide to serve a GenAI model in your service, cloud functions wouldn’t be suitable deployment targets due to their short timeout periods (10 minutes).&#13;
Instead, you’d want to use a model provider API in your services so that you have reliable and scalable access to the model without being constrained by execution time limits.<a data-startref="ix_ch12-asciidoc4" data-type="indexterm" id="id1275"/><a data-startref="ix_ch12-asciidoc3" data-type="indexterm" id="id1276"/></p>&#13;

<h2>Deploying to Managed App Platforms</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="deployment of AI services" data-secondary="options" data-tertiary="deploying to managed app platforms" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc5"/><a data-primary="managed app platforms, deploying to" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc6"/>In addition to cloud functions or VMs, you can upload your codebase as ZIP files to app platforms managed by cloud providers.&#13;
Managed app platforms let you delegate several tasks related to maintenance and management of your services to the cloud provider.&#13;
In exchange, you pay only for the compute resources managed by the cloud provider that serve your application.&#13;
The cloud provider systems allocate and optimize resources based on your application’s needs.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Examples of such services include Azure App Services, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, or Digital Ocean app platform.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Third-party platforms such as Heroku, Hugging Face Spaces, railway.app, render.com, or fly.io also exist for deploying your services directly from code in repositories, which abstract away certain decisions from you so that you can deploy faster and easier.&#13;
Under the hood, third-party managed app platforms may be using the infrastructure of main cloud providers like Azure, Google, or AWS.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The main benefit of deploying to managed app platforms is the ease and speed of deployment, networking, scaling, and maintaining your services.&#13;
Such platforms provide you with tools you need to secure, monitor, scale, and manage your services without having to worry about the underlying resource allocations, security, or software updates.&#13;
They can let you configure load balancers, SSL certificates, domain mappings, monitoring, and staging environments so that you can focus more on application development than deployment workload of the project.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="platform-as-a-service (PaaS)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1277"/><a data-primary="PaaS (platform-as-a-service)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1278"/>Because these platforms follow the platform-as-a-service (PaaS) payment model, you’ll be billed a higher rate compared to relying on your own infrastructure or using lower-level resources such as bare-bone VMs or serverless compute options.&#13;
<a data-primary="infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1279"/><a data-primary="IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1280"/>Alternative services may use the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) payment model that often is more cost-effective.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Personally, I find managed app platforms a convenient way to deploy my applications without much hassle.&#13;
If I’m working on a prototype and need to get my services available to users as fast as possible, managed app platforms is my first go-to option.&#13;
Although, bear in mind that if you need access to GPU hardware for running &#13;
<span class="keep-together">inference</span> services, you’ll have to rely on dedicated VMs, on-premises servers, or specialized AI platform services to serve your models.&#13;
The app platforms can only provide CPU, memory, and disk storage for serving backend services or frontend &#13;
<span class="keep-together">applications.</span></p>&#13;
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>&#13;
<p>A handful of managed cloud provider AI platforms include Azure Machine Learning Studio or Azure AI, Google Cloud Vertex AI Platform, AWS Bedrock and SageMaker, or IBM Watson Studio.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are also third-party platforms for hosting your models including Hugging Face Inference Endpoints, Weights &amp; Biases Platform, or Replicate.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Deploying from code repositories will often require you to add certain configuration files to the root of your project depending on which app platform you will be deploying to.&#13;
The process also depends on whether the app platform supports the application runtime, libraries, and framework versions you’re using, so a successful deployment isn’t always guaranteed.&#13;
It’s also often challenging to migrate to supported runtimes or versions.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Due to these unforeseen issues, many engineers are switching to containerization technologies such as Docker or Podman to package up and deploy their services.&#13;
These containerized applications can then be deployed directly to any app platform supporting containers with guarantees that the application will run no matter what the underlying resources, runtime, or dependency versions are.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Deploying services with containers is now one of the most reliable strategies for shipping your applications to production for users to access.<a data-startref="ix_ch12-asciidoc6" data-type="indexterm" id="id1281"/><a data-startref="ix_ch12-asciidoc5" data-type="indexterm" id="id1282"/></p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>Containerization packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, isolated units that share the host OS kernel.&#13;
On the other hand, virtualization enables running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine using hypervisors.&#13;
Therefore, unlike virtual machines, containers don’t virtualize hardware resources.&#13;
Instead, they run on top of a container runtime platform that abstracts the resources, making them lightweight (i.e., as low as a few megabytes to store) and faster than VMs since they don’t require a separate OS per container.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>In essence, virtualization is about abstracting hardware resources on the host machine while containerization is about abstracting the operating system kernel and running all application components inside an isolated unit called a <em>container</em>.</p>&#13;

<p>The main benefit from using containers is their <em>portability</em>, <em>boot-up speed</em>, <em>compactness</em>, and <em>reliability</em> across various computing environments, as they don’t require a guest OS and a hypervisor software layer.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This makes them perfect for deploying your services with minimal resources, deployment effort and overheads.&#13;
They boot up faster than a VM, and scaling them is also more straightforward.&#13;
You can add more containers to <em>horizontally scale</em> your &#13;

<p><a data-primary="deployment of AI services" data-secondary="containerization with Docker" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc9"/><a data-primary="Docker, containerization with" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc10"/>Docker is a containerization platform used to build, ship, and run containers.&#13;
At the time of writing, Docker has around <a href="https://oreil.ly/A5x63">22% market share</a> in the virtualization platforms market with more than 9 million developers and <a href="https://oreil.ly/8-wx4">11 billion monthly image downloads</a>, making it the most popular containerization platform.&#13;
Many server environments and cloud providers support Docker within many variants of Linux and Windows server.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Chances are if you need to deploy your GenAI services, the easiest and most straightforward option will be to use Docker to containerize your application.&#13;
However, to get comfortable with Docker, you need to understand its architecture and the underlying subsystems such as storage and networking.</p>&#13;

<h2>Docker Architecture</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="deployment of AI services" data-secondary="containerization with Docker" data-tertiary="Docker architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="id1289"/><a data-primary="Docker, containerization with" data-secondary="Docker architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="id1290"/>The Docker system is composed of an engine, a client, and a server:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>Docker engine</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>The engine consists of several components including a client and a server running on the same host OS.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Docker client</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Docker comes with both a <em>CLI tool</em> named <code>docker</code> and a  graphical user interface (GUI) application called <em>Docker Desktop</em>.&#13;
Using the client-server implementation, the Docker client can communicate with the local or a remote server instance using a REST API to manage containers by running commands such as running, stopping, and terminating containers.&#13;
You can also use the client to pull images from an image registry.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Docker server</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>The server is a <em>daemon</em> named <code>dockerd</code>.&#13;
The Docker daemon responds to the client HTTP requests via the REST API and can interact with other daemons.&#13;
It’s also responsible for tracking the lifecycle of containers.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The Docker platform also allows you to create and configure objects such as <em>networks</em>, <em>storage volumes</em>, <em>plug-ins</em>, and service objects to support your deployments.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Most important, to containerize your applications with Docker, you’ll need to build Docker images.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A <em>Docker image</em> is a portable package containing software and acts as a recipe for creating and running your application containers.&#13;
In essence, a container is an in-memory instance of an image.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>&#13;
<p>A container image is <em>immutable</em>, so once you’ve built one, you can’t change it.&#13;
You can only add to an image and not subtract.&#13;
You’ll have to re-create a new one if you want to apply changes.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Docker images are the first step toward containerizing your services as you’ll learn in the next section.</p>&#13;

However, notice how each command changes the image structure that enables you to run your full GenAI services within a container.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can use the <code>docker build</code> command to build the image in <a data-type="xref" href="#containers_dockerfile">Example 12-5</a>:</p>&#13;

<p>Notice the steps listed in the output.&#13;
When each step executes, a new layer gets added to the image you’re building.</p>&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Docker Hub" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc16"/><em>Docker Hub</em> is a managed software-as-a-service (SaaS) container registry for storing and distributing images you create.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Docker Hub is public by default.&#13;
However, you can also use self-hosted or cloud provider private registries such as Azure Container Registry (ACR), AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), or Google Cloud Artifact Registry.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can view the full Docker platform system architecture in <a data-type="xref" href="#docker_architecture">Figure 12-4</a>.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p class="less_space pagebreak-before">As you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#docker_architecture">Figure 12-4</a>, the Docker daemon manages containers and images.&#13;
It creates containers from images and communicates with the Docker client, handling commands to build and run images.&#13;
The Docker daemon can also pull images from or push them to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub) that contains  images like Ubuntu, Redis, or PostgreSQL.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Using the Docker Hub registry, you can access other contributed images alongside distributing and version controlling your own.&#13;
Registries like Docker Hub play a crucial role in scaling your services as container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes need access to registries to pull and run multiple container instances from images.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can pull public images from Docker Hub using the <code>docker pull</code> command:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting">$<code class="w"> </code>docker<code class="w"> </code>image<code class="w"> </code>pull<code class="w"> </code>python:3.12-slim<code class="w"/>&#13;

&#13;
<p>When you push and pull images, you’ll need to specify a <em>tag</em> using the <code>&lt;name&gt;:&lt;tag&gt;</code> syntax.&#13;
If you don’t provide a tag, Docker engine will use the <code>latest</code> tag by default.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Aside from pulling, you can also store your own images in container registries. First, you need to build and tag your image with both a version label and the image repository URL:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting">$<code class="w"> </code>docker<code class="w"> </code>build<code class="w"> </code>-t<code class="w"> </code>genai-service:latest<code class="w"> </code>.<code class="w"/>&#13;
&#13;
$<code class="w"> </code>docker<code class="w"> </code>image<code class="w"> </code>tag<code class="w"> </code>genai-service:latest<code class="w"> </code>docker.io/myrepo/genai-service:latest<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Once your image is built and tagged, you can then push it to the Docker Hub container registry using the <code>docker push</code> command.&#13;
You may need to log in first to authenticate with the hub:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting">$<code class="w"> </code>docker<code class="w"> </code>login<code class="w"/>&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
195be5f8be1d:<code class="w"> </code>Pushed<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>Be careful that during a push, you don’t overwrite the tag for an image in many repositories.&#13;
For instance, an image built and tagged <code>genai:latest</code> in a repository can be overwritten by another image tagged <code>genai:latest</code>.<a data-startref="ix_ch12-asciidoc16" data-type="indexterm" id="id1296"/></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Now that your image is stored in the registry, you can pull it down on another machine<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#id1297" id="id1297-marker">3</a></sup> or at a later time to run the image without the need to rebuild it.<a data-startref="ix_ch12-asciidoc15" data-type="indexterm" id="id1298"/><a data-startref="ix_ch12-asciidoc14" data-type="indexterm" id="id1299"/></p>&#13;

<p>Using <code>Unionfs</code>, directories of distinct filesystems can be combined and overlaid to form a single coherent virtual filesystem, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#docker_unionfs">Figure 12-5</a>.</p>&#13;

<p>Using the <code>Unionfs</code>, Docker can add or remove branches as you build out your container filesystem from an image.</p>&#13;
<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="id1302">&#13;
<h1>Why Do Docker Containers Use Unionfs?</h1>&#13;
<p>Imagine you have 10 container instances running from a 1 GB image.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A container is essentially a process. In Linux, new processes are created by forking existing ones.&#13;
The fork operation generates a separate address space for the child process, which contains an exact copy of the parent’s memory segments.&#13;
To create a new container, all files from the image layers are copied into the container’s namespace.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If your containers use a concrete filesystem, you’ll end up needing 10 GB of physical memory to run them.&#13;
So, your disk space usage won’t be optimized.&#13;
In addition, since you want your containers to start fast (ideally within a second), having to copy 1 GB of files from image layers to container namespace would significantly increase the cold start time.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Therefore, you’d need a mechanism to share physical memory segments across containers efficiently.&#13;
That’s why Unionfs is now used in containers to give a unified view to files and directories of separate filesystems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In essence, it mounts multiple directories to a single root, so you can think of it as a mounting mechanism rather than a filesystem.</p>&#13;
</div></aside>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To illustrate the mechanism of layered architecture in containers, let’s review the image from <a data-type="xref" href="#containers_dockerfile">Example 12-5</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When building the image using <a data-type="xref" href="#containers_dockerfile">Example 12-5</a>, you’re layering a Python 3.12 base image running on a Linux distribution on top of a root filesystem.&#13;
Next, you’re adding <em>requirements.txt</em> on top of the Python base image and then installing dependencies on top of <em>requirements.txt</em> layer.&#13;
You then add a new layer by coping the content of your project directory into the container, layering it on top of everything else.&#13;
Finally, when you start the container with the <code>uvicorn</code> command, you add a final writable layer as part of the container filesystem.&#13;
As a result, the ordering of layers becomes important when building Docker images.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#docker_branches">Figure 12-6</a> shows the layered filesystem architecture.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="docker_branches">&#13;
<img alt="bgai 1206" src="assets/bgai_1206.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 12-6. </span>Layered Unionfs filesystem architecture</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In <a data-type="xref" href="#containers_dockerfile">Example 12-5</a>, each of the command steps is creating a cached image as the build process finalizes the container image.&#13;
To run commands, intermediate containers are created and then automatically deleted after.&#13;
The underlying cached image is kept on the build host and isn’t removed.&#13;
These temporary images are layered over the previous image and combined into a single image once all steps are completed.&#13;
This optimization allows future builds to reuse these images to speed up build times.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>At the end, the container will comprise one or more image layers and a final ephemeral container layer (i.e., that won’t be persisted) when the container is destroyed.<a data-startref="ix_ch12-asciidoc19" data-type="indexterm" id="id1303"/><a data-startref="ix_ch12-asciidoc18" data-type="indexterm" id="id1304"/><a data-startref="ix_ch12-asciidoc17" data-type="indexterm" id="id1305"/></p>&#13;

During the development of your services as containers, you can use these tools to manage data persistence, sharing data between containers and maintaining state between container restarts.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="ephemeral storage" data-type="indexterm" id="id1306"/>When working with containers, your application may need to write data to the disk, which will persist in an <em>ephemeral</em> storage.&#13;
Ephemeral storage is a short-lived, temporary storage deleted once the container is stopped, restarted, or removed.&#13;
If you restart your container, you’ll notice that previously persisted data is no longer available.&#13;
Under the hood, Docker writes the runtime data to an ephemeral writable container layer in the container’s virtual filesystem.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>You’ll lose all your application generated data and log files you’ve written to disk during a container’s runtime if you rely on the container’s default storage configuration.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To avoid loss of application runtime data and logs, you have several storage options available that enable you to persist data during a container’s lifetime.&#13;
During development, you can use <em>volumes</em> or <em>bind mounts</em> to persist data to the host OS filesystem or rely on local databases for persisting data.</p>&#13;

<p>We’ll now study each storage option in detail so you can simulate your production environment locally with Docker containers using the appropriate storage.&#13;
When deploying containers to production within a cloud environment, you can use a database or cloud storage offering for persisting data instead of Docker volumes or bind mounts to centralize storage across multiple containers.</p>&#13;

To create a volume, you can run the following command:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">$ docker volume create -n data</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Once created, you can use volumes to persist data between container runs.  Volumes also allow you to persist data when you use database and memory store containers.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>Restarting a database container with new environment variables may not be enough to reset them with new settings.</p>&#13;

&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 12-8. </span>Bind mounts between host filesystem and a container</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The mounts happen as you start your container.&#13;
With the mounted directories, you can then directly access them from within the &#13;
<span class="keep-together">container.</span>&#13;
You can read and persist data to the mounted directories as you run and stop your containers.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To run a container with a volume bind mount, you can use the following command:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting">$<code class="w"> </code>docker<code class="w"> </code>run<code class="w"> </code>-v<code class="w"> </code>src:/app<code class="w"> </code>genai-service<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Here, the <code>-v</code> flag allows you to map the host directory to a container directory using the <code>&lt;host_dir&gt;:&lt;container_dir&gt;</code> syntax.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>The functionality of the <code>COPY</code> command you use in a Dockerfile is different from directory mounting.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The former makes a separate copy of a host directory into the container during the image build process while the latter allows you to access and update the mapped host directory from within the &#13;
<span class="keep-together">container.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This means that if you’re not careful, you can unintentionally modify or delete all your original files on the host machine permanently, from within the container.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Bind mount volumes can still be useful in a local development environment.&#13;
As you change the source code of your services, you’ll be able to observe the real-time impact of modifications on the running application containers.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>This temporary mount will only persist the data to the host memory (RAM) during the container’s runtime and increases the container’s performance by avoiding writes into the container’s writeable layer.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When containerizing GenAI applications, you can use temporary mounts to store cached results, intermediate model computations, temporary files, and session-specific logs that you won’t need once the container stops.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>&#13;
<p>The container’s writeable layer is tightly coupled with the host machine through a storage driver to implement the union filesystem.&#13;
Therefore, writing to the container’s writable layer reduces performance due to this additional layer of abstraction.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Instead, you can use data volumes for persistent storage that writes directly to the host filesystem or tmpfs mounts for temporary in-memory storage.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Unlike bind mounts and volumes, you can’t share the tmpfs mount between containers, and the functionality is available only on Linux systems.&#13;
In addition, if you adjust directory permissions on tmpfs mounts, they can reset when the container restarts.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="less_space pagebreak-before">Here are a few other use cases of tmpfs mounts:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Temporarily storing data caches, API responses, logs, test data, configuration files, and AI model artifacts in-memory</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Avoiding I/O writes to disks while working with library APIs that require file-like objects</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Simulating high-speed I/O with rapid file access and writes</p>&#13;

<h3>Handling filesystem permissions</h3>&#13;

<p><a data-primary="deployment of AI services" data-secondary="containerization with Docker" data-tertiary="handling filesystem permissions" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc22"/><a data-primary="Docker, containerization with" data-secondary="Docker storage mechanisms" data-tertiary="handling filesystem permissions" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc23"/>A big source of frustration and a security consideration for many developers new to Docker is managing directory permissions when using filesystem bind mounts between the host OS and the container.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>By default, Docker runs containers as the <code>root</code> user leading to containers having full read/write access to mounted directories on the host OS.&#13;
If the <code>root</code> user inside the container creates directories or files, they will be owned by <code>root</code> on the host as well.&#13;
You can then face permission issues if you have a nonroot user account on the host when you try to access or modify these directories or files.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>Running containers as the default <code>root</code> user is also a great security risk if a malicious actor gets access to the container since they’ll have access to the host system as <code>root</code>.&#13;
Additionally, if you run a compromised image, you might risk executing malicious code on your host system with <code>root</code> privileges.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To mitigate permission issues when running containers with bind mounts, you can use the <code>--user</code> flag to run the container as a nonroot user:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting">$<code class="w"> </code>docker<code class="w"> </code>run<code class="w"> </code>--user<code class="w"> </code>genai-service<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Alternatively, you can create and switch to a nonroot user within the final layers of the image build inside the Dockerfile, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#docker_permissions">Example 12-6</a>.</p>&#13;

<p>Often, you’ll need to install packages or add configurations that require privileged disk access or permissions.&#13;
You should only switch to a nonroot user at the end of an image build once you’ve completed such installations and configurations.&#13;
Avoid switching back and forth between root and nonroot users to prevent any unnecessary complexity and excess image layers.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you hit issues with creating new groups or users in <a data-type="xref" href="#docker_permissions">Example 12-6</a>, try changing the <code>USER_UID</code> and <code>USER_GID</code> as those IDs may already be in use by another nonroot user in the image.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s assume that during the image creation, the <code>root</code> user in the container has created the <code>myscripts</code> folder.&#13;
You can inspect filesystem permissions using the <code>ls -l</code> command, which returns the following output:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting">total<code class="w"> </code><code class="m">12</code><code class="w"/>&#13;
drw-r--r--<code class="w"> </code><code class="m">2</code><code class="w"> </code>root<code class="w"> </code>root<code class="w"> </code><code class="m">4096</code><code class="w"> </code>Oct<code class="w">  </code><code class="m">1</code><code class="w"> </code><code class="m">10</code>:00<code class="w"> </code>myscripts<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can read permissions <code>drwxr-xr-x</code> for the <code>myscripts</code> directory using the following breakdown:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><code>d</code>: Specifies that <code>myscripts</code> is a directory; otherwise would show a <code>-</code>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><code>rwx</code>: Owner <code>root</code> user can (r)read, (w)rite, and e(x)ecute files in this &#13;
<span class="keep-together">directory.</span></p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><code>r--</code>: Group <code>root</code> members can perform (r)ead-only operations but can’t write or execute any files.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><code>r--</code>: Everyone else can read the file but cannot write to or execute it.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#id1317" id="id1317-marker">4</a></sup></p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you want to set ownership or permissions on the <code>myscripts</code> directory, you can use the <code>chmod</code> or <code>chown</code> commands in Linux systems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Use the <code>chown</code> command to change the directory owner on host so that you can edit the files in your code editor:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting"><code class="c1"># Set file or directory ownership</code>&#13;
$<code class="w"> </code>sudo<code class="w"> </code>chown<code class="w"> </code>-R<code class="w"> </code>username:groupname<code class="w"> </code>mydir<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Alternatively, if you only need to execute the scripts in the <code>myscripts</code> directory, use the <code>chmod</code> command to change the file or directory permissions:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting"><code class="c1"># Set execute permissions using flags</code>&#13;
$<code class="w"> </code>sudo<code class="w"> </code>chmod<code class="w"> </code>-R<code class="w"> </code>+x<code class="w"> </code>myscripts<code class="w"/>&#13;
&#13;
<code class="c1"># Set execute permissions in a numeric form</code>&#13;
$<code class="w"> </code>sudo<code class="w"> </code>chmod<code class="w"> </code>-R<code class="w"> </code><code class="m">755</code><code class="w"> </code>myscripts<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>&#13;
<p>The <code>-R</code> flag will recursively set the ownership or permissions on a nested directory.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This command will allow <code>root</code> group members and other users to execute files in the <code>myscripts</code> directory.&#13;
Others can execute the files only if they use the <code>bash</code> command.&#13;
However, only the owner can modify them.</p>&#13;

<h2>Docker Networking</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="deployment of AI services" data-secondary="containerization with Docker" data-tertiary="Docker networking" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc24"/><a data-primary="Docker, containerization with" data-secondary="Docker networking" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc25"/>Docker networking is one of the hardest concepts to grasp in multicontainer projects.&#13;
This section covers how Docker networking works and how to set up local containers to communicate, simulating production environments during development.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Often, when you’re deploying to production environments in the cloud, you configure networking using the cloud provider’s solutions.&#13;
However, if you need to connect containers in a development environment for local testing or deploying on on-premises resources, then you’ll benefit from understanding how Docker networking works.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you’re developing GenAI services that interact with external systems like databases, chances are you’ll be using multiple containers;&#13;
one for your application and one for running each of your databases or external systems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Docker ships with a networking subsystem that allows containers to connect with each other on the same or different hosts.&#13;
You can even connect containers via internet-facing hosts.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When you create containers using the <code>docker run</code> command, they’ll have networking enabled by default on a <em>bridge network</em> so that they can make outgoing connections.&#13;
However, they won’t expose or publish their ports to the outside world.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p><a data-primary="firewall rules" data-type="indexterm" id="id1326"/>With the default settings, Docker interacts with the OS kernels to configure <em>firewall rules</em> (e.g., <code>iptables</code> and <code>ip6tables</code> rules on Linux) to implement network isolation, port publishing, and &#13;
<span class="keep-together">filtering.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since Docker can override these firewall rules, if you have a port on host like <code>8000</code> closed, Docker can force it open and expose it outside the host machine when you run a container with the <code>-p 8000:8000</code> flag.&#13;
To prevent such an exposure, a solution is to run containers using <code>-p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000</code>.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For the networking subsystem to function, Docker uses <em>networking drivers</em>, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#docker_networking_drivers">Table 12-3</a>.</p>&#13;
<table class="striped" id="docker_networking_drivers">&#13;

</tr>&#13;
</tbody>&#13;
</table>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To ensure your containers can communicate together, you may need to specify networking settings and drivers.&#13;
You can select a networking driver that matches your use case based on <a data-type="xref" href="#docker_networking_drivers">Table 12-3</a>.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>Some of these drivers may not be available depending on the platform/host OS you’re running Docker on (Windows, Linux, or macOS host).</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The most commonly used network drivers are bridge, host, and none.&#13;
You likely won’t need to use other drivers (e.g., overlay, Macvlan, IPVlan) unless you need more advanced networking configurations.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#docker_networking_drivers_viz">Figure 12-9</a> visualizes the functionality of the bridge, host, none, overlay, Macvlan, and IPVlan drivers.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Docker, containerization with" data-secondary="Docker networking" data-tertiary="bridge network driver" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc26"/>The bridge network driver connects containers by creating a default bridge network <code>docker0</code> and associating containers with it and the host’s main network interface, unless otherwise specified.&#13;
This will allow your containers to access the host network (and the internet) plus allow you to access the containers.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can view the networks using the <code>docker network ls</code> command:</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>The <em>network bridge</em> in Docker is a link layer software device running within the host machine’s kernel, allowing linked containers to communicate while isolating non-connected containers.&#13;
The bridge driver automatically installs rules in the host machine so that containers on different bridge networks can’t communicate directly.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>&#13;
<p>Bridge networks only apply to containers running on the same Docker engine/daemon host.&#13;
To connect containers running on other daemon hosts, you can manage routing at the host OS layer or use an <em>overlay</em> driver.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In addition to default bridge networks, you can create your own custom networks, which can provide superior isolation and packet routing experience.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>User-defined networks are superior to the default bridge networks as they provide better isolation.&#13;
In addition, containers can resolve each other by name or alias on user-defined bridge networks unlike the default network where they can only communicate via IP addresses.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>If you run containers without specifying <code>--network</code>, they’ll be attached to the default bridge network.&#13;
This can be a security issue as unrelated services are then able to communicate and access each other.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To create a network, you can use the <code>docker network create</code> command, which will use <code>--driver bridge</code> flag by default:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting">$<code class="w"> </code>docker<code class="w"> </code>network<code class="w"> </code>create<code class="w"> </code>genai-net<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;

<p>For instance, if you name your application container as <code>genai-service</code> and your database container as <code>db</code>, then your <code>genai-service</code> container can communicate with the database by calling the <code>db</code> hostname.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>You can’t access the <code>db</code> container from outside of the Docker bridge network by its name, as the embedded DNS server is not visible to the host machine.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Instead, you can expose a container port <code>5432</code> and access the <code>db</code> container using host’s network (e.g., via <code>localhost:5432</code>).</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s discuss how you can publish container ports to the outside environment such as the host machine next.</p>&#13;

<h4>Publishing ports</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Docker, containerization with" data-secondary="bridge network driver" data-tertiary="publishing ports" data-type="indexterm" id="id1329"/>When you run containers in a network, they automatically expose ports to each other.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you need to access containers from the host machine or non-Docker processes on different networks, you’ll need to expose the container ports by publishing them using the <code>--publish</code> or <code>-p</code> flag:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting">$<code class="w"> </code>docker<code class="w"> </code>run<code class="w"> </code>-p<code class="w"> </code><code class="m">127</code>.0.0.1:8000:8000<code class="w"> </code>myimage<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This command allows you to create a container with exposed port <code>8000</code> mapped to <code>8000</code> port on the host machine (e.g., localhost) using the <code>&lt;host_port&gt;:​&lt;con⁠tainer_port&gt;</code> syntax.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When you don’t specify a container port, Docker will publish and map port <code>80</code> by default.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>Always double-check ports you want to expose and avoid publishing container ports that are already in use on your host machine.&#13;
Otherwise, there’ll be <em>port conflicts</em> leading to requests being routed to conflicting services, which will also be time-consuming to &#13;
<span class="keep-together">troubleshoot.</span></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If using bridge networks and port mappings are causing you a lot of trouble, you can also use the <em>host</em> networking driver for connecting your containers, albeit without the same isolation and security benefits of bridge networks.<a data-startref="ix_ch12-asciidoc26" data-type="indexterm" id="id1330"/></p>&#13;

<h3>Host network driver</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Docker, containerization with" data-secondary="Docker networking" data-tertiary="host network driver" data-type="indexterm" id="id1331"/>A <em>host</em> network driver is useful for cases where you want to improve performance, when you want to avoid the container port mapping, or when one of your containers needs to handle a large number of ports.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Running a container with the host driver is as simple as using the <code>--net=host</code> flag with the <code>docker run</code> command:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting">$<code class="w"> </code>docker<code class="w"> </code>run<code class="w"> </code>--net<code class="o">=</code>host<code class="w"> </code>genai-service<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In host networking, containers share the host machine’s network namespace, meaning that containers won’t be isolated from the Docker host.&#13;
Therefore, containers won’t be allocated their own IP address.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>As soon as you enable the host network driver, previously published ports will be discarded, as containers won’t have their own IP address.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The host network driver is more performant because it doesn’t need a <em>network address translation</em> (NAT) for mapping IP addresses from one namespace (containers) to another (host machine) and avoids creating a <em>user-land proxy</em> (i.e., port forwarding) for each port.&#13;
However, host networking is only supported with Linux—and not Windows—containers.&#13;
In addition, containers won’t have access to the network interfaces of the host so can’t bind to host’s IP addresses, leading to added complexity in the network configuration you need.</p>&#13;

<h3>None network driver</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Docker, containerization with" data-secondary="Docker networking" data-tertiary="none network driver" data-type="indexterm" id="id1332"/><a data-primary="none network driver (Docker)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1333"/>If you want to completely isolate the networking stack of a container, you can use the <code>--network none</code> flag when starting the container.&#13;
Within the container, only the loopback device is created, a virtual network interface that the container uses to communicate with itself. You can specify the none network driver using the following command:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting">$<code class="w"> </code>docker<code class="w"> </code>run<code class="w"> </code>--network<code class="w"> </code>none<code class="w"> </code>genai-service<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>These are a few cases where isolating containers are useful:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Applications handling highly sensitive data or running critical processes</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Where there’s a higher risk of network-based attacks or malware</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Performing network debugging and simulating network outages by eliminating external interference</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Running stand-alone containers without external dependencies can run &#13;
<span class="keep-together">independently</span></p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Operating transient containers for short-lived processes to minimize network exposure</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Generally, use the none network driver if you need to isolate containers from any Docker and non-Docker processes for security reasons.<a data-startref="ix_ch12-asciidoc25" data-type="indexterm" id="id1334"/><a data-startref="ix_ch12-asciidoc24" data-type="indexterm" id="id1335"/></p>&#13;

<h2>Docker Compose</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Docker Compose tool" data-secondary="basics" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc30"/>In multicontainer environments, you can use the <em>Docker Compose</em> tool for defining and running application containers for a streamlined development and deployment experience.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Using Docker Compose can help you simplify managing several containers, networks, volumes, variables, and secrets with a single <em>YAML configuration file</em>.&#13;
This simplifies the complex task of orchestrating and coordinating various containers, making it easier to manage and replicate your services across different application environments using environment variables.&#13;
You can also share the YAML file with others so that they can replicate your container environment.&#13;
Additionally, it caches configurations to prevent re-creating containers when you restart services.</p>&#13;

<p>Docker Compose <code>watch</code> allows for greater granularity than is practical with bind mounts, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#docker_compose">Example 12-9</a>.&#13;
For instance, it lets you ignore specific files or entire directories within the watched tree to avoid I/O performance issues.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Besides using Docker Compose <code>watch</code>, you can merge and override multiple Compose files to create a composite configuration tailored for specific build environments.&#13;
Typically, the <code>compose.yml</code> file contains the base configurations, which can be overridden by an optional <code>compose.override.yml</code> file.&#13;
For instance, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#compose_override">Example 12-11</a>, you can inject local environment settings, mount local volumes, and create new a database service.</p>&#13;

<h2>Optimizing Docker Images</h2>&#13;

<p><a data-primary="deployment of AI services" data-secondary="containerization with Docker" data-tertiary="optimizing Docker images" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc31"/><a data-primary="Docker, containerization with" data-secondary="optimizing Docker images" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc32"/>If your Docker images grow in size, they’ll also be slower to run, build, and test in production.&#13;
You’ll also be spending a lot of development time iterating over the development of the image.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In that case, it’s important to understand image optimization strategies, including how to use Docker’s layering mechanism to keep images lightweight and efficient to run, in particular with GenAI workloads.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>These are a few ways to reduce image size and speed up the build process:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Using minimal base images</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Avoiding GPU inference runtimes</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Externalizing application data</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Layering ordering and caching</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Using multi-stage builds</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Implementing these optimizations as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#build_optimization_impact">Table 12-4</a> may reduce typical image sizes from several gigabytes to less than 1 GB.&#13;
Similarly, build times can reduce from several minutes on average to less than a minute.</p>&#13;

<h3>Use minimal base image</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Docker, containerization with" data-secondary="optimizing Docker images" data-tertiary="using minimal base image" data-type="indexterm" id="id1344"/>Base images allow you to start from a preconfigured image so you don’t have to install everything from scratch, including the Python interpreter.&#13;
However, some base images available on the Docker Hub may not be suitable for production deployments.&#13;
Instead, you’ll want to select the right base image with a minimal OS footprint to work from for faster builds and smaller image sizes, possibly with pre-installed Python dependencies and support for installing its various packages.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Alpine base images use a lightweight Alpine Linux distribution designed to be small and secure, containing only the <em>base minimum</em> essential tools to run your application, but this won’t support installing many Python packages.&#13;
On the other hand, slim base images may use other Linux distributions like Debian or CentOS, containing the <em>necessary</em> essential tools for running applications that make them larger than Alpine base images.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>&#13;
<p>Use slim base images if you care about build time and Alpine base images if you care about image size.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can use the <code>slim</code> base images such as <code>python:3.12-slim</code> or even Alpine base images like <code>python:3.12-alpine</code> that can be as small as 71.4 MB.&#13;
A bare-bones Alpine image can even go down to 12.1 MB. The following command shows a list of base images pulled from the Docker repository:</p>&#13;

<h3>Avoid GPU inference runtimes</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Docker, containerization with" data-secondary="optimizing Docker images" data-tertiary="avoiding GPU inference runtimes" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc33"/><a data-primary="GPUs" data-secondary="avoiding GPU inference runtimes in Docker" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc34"/>In AI workloads where you’re serving ML/GenAI models, you may need to install deep learning frameworks, dependencies, and GPU libraries that can suddenly explode the footprint of your images.&#13;
For instance, to make inferences on a GPU using the <code>transformers</code> library, you’ll need to install 3 GB of NVIDIA packages for GPU inference, 1.6 GB for the <code>torch</code> to perform the inference.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Unfortunately, you can’t reduce the image size if you need to use a GPU to perform an inference.&#13;
<a data-primary="Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1345"/>However, if you can avoid GPU inference and just rely on CPUs, you may be able to reduce the image size by up to 10 times using the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) runtime with model quantization.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch10">Chapter 10</a>, you can use the INT8 quantization with an ONNX model to benefit from model compression without much loss in output quality.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To switch from the GPU inference runtime to the ONNX runtime for Hugging Face transformer models, you can use the <code>transformers[onnx]</code> package:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">$ pip install transformers[onnx]</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can then export any Hugging Face transformer model checkpoint with default configurations to the ONNX format with <code>transformers.onnx</code>:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">$ python -m transformers.onnx --model=distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased onnx/</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This command exports the <code>distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased</code> model checkpoint as an ONNX graph stored in <code>onnx/model.onnx</code>, which can be run with any Hugging Face model accelerator that supports the ONNX standard, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#docker_onnx">Example 12-13</a>.</p>&#13;

<p><a data-primary="Docker, containerization with" data-secondary="optimizing Docker images" data-tertiary="externalizing application data" data-type="indexterm" id="id1348"/>A core contributor to image size is copying models and application data into the image during build time.&#13;
This approach increases both the build time and image size.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A better approach is to use volumes during local development and external storage solutions for downloading and loading models at application startup in production.&#13;
In Kubernetes container orchestration environments, you can also use persistent volumes for model storage.</p>&#13;

<p>If your application container takes a long time to download data and model artifacts from an external source, your health checks may fail, and the hosting platform can kill your containers prematurely.&#13;
In such cases, configure health check probes to wait longer or as a last resort, bake the model into the image.</p>&#13;

<h3>Layer ordering and caching</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="caching" data-secondary="in Docker" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc35"/><a data-primary="Docker, containerization with" data-secondary="optimizing Docker images" data-tertiary="layer ordering and caching" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc36"/>Docker uses a layered filesystem to create layers in an image for each instruction in the Dockerfile.&#13;
These layers are like a stack, with each layer adding more content on top of the previous layers.&#13;
Whenever a layer changes, that layer (and further layers) will need to be rebuilt for those changes to appear in the image (i.e., build cache must be invalidated).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A layer (i.e., a filesystem snapshot) is created if the instruction is writing or deleting files into the container’s union filesystem.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>&#13;
<p>Dockerfile instructions that modify the filesystem like <code>ENV</code>, <code>COPY</code>, <code>ADD</code>, and <code>RUN</code> will contribute new layers to the build process, effectively increasing the image size.&#13;
On the other hand, instructions such as  <code>WORKDIR</code>, <code>ENTRYPOINT</code>, <code>LABEL</code>, and <code>CMD</code> that only update the image metadata don’t create any layers and any build cache.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>After creation, each layer is then cached for reusability across image rebuilds if the instruction and files it depends on haven’t changed since the last build.&#13;
Therefore, ideally, you want to write a Dockerfile that allows you to stop, destroy, rebuild, and replace containers with minimal setup and configuration.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are a few techniques you can use to minimize and optimize these layers as much as possible.</p>&#13;

<h4>Layer ordering to avoid frequent cache invalidation</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since changes to the earlier layers can invalidate the build cache leading to repeating steps, you should order your Dockerfile from the most stable (e.g., installations) to the most frequently changing or volatile (e.g., application code, configuration files).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Following this ordering, place the most stable yet expensive instructions (e.g., model downloads or heavy dependency installations) at the start of the Dockerfile, and volatile, fast operations (e.g., copying application code) at the bottom.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Imagine your Dockerfile file looks like this:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="dockerfile" data-type="programlisting"><code class="k">FROM</code><code class="w"> </code><code class="s">python:3.12-slim</code><code class="w"> </code><code class="k">as</code><code class="w"> </code><code class="s">base</code><code class="w"/>&#13;
<code class="c"># Changes to the</code><code class="w"/>&#13;
<code class="k">COPY</code><code class="w"> </code>.<code class="w"> </code>.<code class="w"/>&#13;
<code class="k">RUN</code><code class="w"> </code>pip<code class="w"> </code>install<code class="w"> </code>requirements.txt<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Here you’re creating a layer by copying your working directory containing the application code into the image before downloading and installing dependencies.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If any one of source files changes, Docker builder will invalidate the cache causing the dependency installation to be repeated, which is expensive and can take several minutes to complete, if not cached by <code>pip</code>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To avoid repeating expensive steps, you can logically order your Dockerfile instructions to optimize the layer caching by reordering instructions like these:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="dockerfile" data-type="programlisting"><code class="k">FROM</code><code class="w"> </code><code class="s">python:3.12-slim</code><code class="w"> </code><code class="k">as</code><code class="w"> </code><code class="s">base</code><code class="w"/>&#13;
<code class="k">COPY</code><code class="w"> </code>requirements.txt<code class="w"> </code>requirements.txt<code class="w"/>&#13;
<code class="k">RUN</code><code class="w"> </code>pip<code class="w"> </code>install<code class="w"> </code>requirements.txt<code class="w"/>&#13;
<code class="k">COPY</code><code class="w"> </code>.<code class="w"> </code>.<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Now any changes to the source files won’t affect the long dependency installation step, drastically speeding up the build process.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Minimize layers" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="id227">&#13;
<h4>Minimize layers</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To keep image sizes small, you’ll want to minimize image layers as much as possible.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A simple technique to achieve this is to combine multiple <code>RUN</code> instructions into one.&#13;
For instance, instead of writing multiple <code>RUN apt-get</code> installations, you can combine them into a single <code>RUN</code> command with <code>&amp;&amp;</code>:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="dockerfile" data-type="programlisting"><code class="k">RUN</code><code class="w"> </code>apt-get<code class="w"> </code>update<code class="w"> </code><code class="o">&amp;&amp;</code><code class="w"> </code>apt-get<code class="w"> </code>install<code class="w"> </code>-y<code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="cache busting" data-type="indexterm" id="id1349"/>This will avoid adding unnecessary layers and prevents caching issues with <code>apt-get update</code> using the <em>cache busting</em> technique.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since the builder may potentially skip updating the package index, causing installations to fail or use outdated packages, using the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> ensures that the latest packages are installed if the package index is updated.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>&#13;
<p>You can also use the <code>--no-cache</code> flag when using <code>docker build</code> to avoid cache hits and ensure fresh downloads of base images and dependencies on every build.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Keep build context small" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="id228">&#13;
<h4>Keep build context small</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="build context (Docker)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1350"/>The <em>build context</em> is the set of files and directories that’ll be sent to the builder to carry out the Dockerfile instruction.&#13;
A smaller build context reduces the amount of data sent to the builder and lowers the chance of cache invalidation, resulting in faster builds.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When you use the <code>COPY . .</code> command in a Dockerfile to copy your working directory into an image, you may also add tool caches, development dependencies, virtual environments, and unused files into the build context.&#13;
Not only the image size will be increased, but also the Docker builder will cache these unnecessary files.&#13;
Any changes to these files will then invalidate the build, restarting the whole build process.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To prevent the unnecessary cache invalidation, you can add a <em>.dockerignore</em> file next to your Dockerfile, listing all files and directories that your services won’t need in production.&#13;
As an example, here are items you can include in a <em>.dockerignore</em> file:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">**/.DS_Store&#13;
**/__pycache__&#13;
**/.mypy_cache&#13;
**/.venv&#13;
**/.env&#13;
**/.git</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Docker builder will then ignore these files even when you run the <code>COPY</code> command across your entire working directory.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Use cache and bind mounts" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="id229">&#13;
<h4>Use cache and bind mounts</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="bind mounts (Docker)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1351"/><a data-primary="cache mounts (Docker)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1352"/>You can use <em>bind mounts</em> to avoid adding unnecessary layers to the image and <em>cache mounts</em> to speed up subsequent builds.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Bind mounts temporarily include files in the build context for a single <code>RUN</code> instruction and won’t persist as image layers after.&#13;
Cache mounts specify a persistent cache location that you can read and write data to across multiple builds.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Here is an example where you can download a pretrained model from Hugging Face into a mounted cache to optimize layer caching:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="dockerfile" data-type="programlisting"><code class="k">RUN</code><code class="w"> </code>--mount<code class="o">=</code><code class="nv">type</code><code class="o">=</code>cache,target<code class="o">=</code>/root/.cache/huggingface<code class="w"> </code><code class="o">&amp;&amp;</code><code class="w"> </code><code class="se">\</code>&#13;
<code class="w">    </code>pip<code class="w"> </code>install<code class="w"> </code>transformers<code class="w"> </code><code class="o">&amp;&amp;</code><code class="w"> </code><code class="se">\</code>&#13;
<code class="w">    </code>python<code class="w"> </code>-c<code class="w"> </code><code class="s2">"from transformers import AutoModel; \</code>&#13;
<code class="s2">    AutoModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')"</code><code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This <code>RUN</code> instruction creates a cache of the downloaded pretrained model at &#13;
<span class="keep-together"><code>/root/.cache/huggingface</code>,</span> which can be shared across multiple builds.&#13;
This helps avoid redundant downloads and optimizes the build process by reusing cached layers.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can also use the <code>--no-cache-dir</code> flag when using the <code>pip</code> package manager to avoid caching altogether for minimizing image size.&#13;
However, you’ll have a significantly slower build process as follow-on builds will need to redownload each time.</p>&#13;

<h4>Use external cache</h4>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you’re building and deploying containers using a CI/CD pipeline, you can benefit from an external cache hosted on a remote location.&#13;
An external cache can drastically speed up the build process in CI/CD pipelines where builders are often ephemeral and build minutes are precious.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To use an external cache, you can specify the <code>--cache-to</code> and <code>--cache-from</code> options with the <code>docker buildx build</code> command:</p>&#13;
&#13;

<h3>Multi-stage builds</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Docker, containerization with" data-secondary="optimizing Docker images" data-tertiary="multi-stage builds" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch12-asciidoc37"/>Using <em>multi-stage builds</em>, you can reduce the size of your final image by splitting out the Dockerfile instructions into distinct stages.&#13;
Common stages can be reused to include shared components and serve as a starting point for further stages.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can also selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don’t want in the final image.&#13;
This ensures that only the required outputs are included in the final image from previous stages, avoiding any non-essential artifacts.&#13;
Furthermore, you can also execute multiple build stages in parallel to speed up the build process of your images.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A common multi-stage build pattern is when you need a testing/development image and a slimmer production one with both starting from a shared first stage image.&#13;
The development or testing image can include additional layers of tooling (i.e., compilers, build systems, and debugging tools) to support the required workflows.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Imagine you need to serve a bert transformer model from Hugging Face in a FastAPI service.&#13;
You can write your Dockerfile instructions to use three distinct sequential stages.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The first stage downloads the transformer model into <code>/root/.cache/huggingface</code> and creates a Python virtual environment at <code>/opt/venv</code>:</p>&#13;

<p>In this chapter, we reviewed various strategies for deploying your GenAI services—for instance, on virtual machines, as cloud functions, with managed app service platforms, or via containers.&#13;
As part of this, I covered how virtualization differs from containerization and why you may want to deploy your services as containers.</p>&#13;

<p>Next, you learned about the Docker containerization platform and how you can use it to build self-contained images of your applications that can run as containers.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We covered the Docker storage and networking mechanisms that allow you to persist data using the union filesystem in containers and how to connect containers with different networking drivers.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Finally, you were introduced to various optimization techniques for reducing the build time and size of your images to deploy your GenAI services as efficiently as possible.</p>&#13;
