<h1><span class="label">Chapter 1. </span>The Role of <span class="keep-together">AI Product Managers</span></h1>

<p>The <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-type="indexterm" id="icd101"/>first AI team I ever worked for was designing something special: smart home–assistant devices that could understand a wide variety of accents, and even recognize who was talking and what they were instructing the assistant to do. It was the early days of voice assistants and smart homes. I had always been interested in the conjunction of language and tech, and I knew many voice systems didn’t really “get” different ways of speaking. The Speech team’s goal was to make an AI that did.</p>

<p>That was a really complicated task. We wrangled enormous datasets, refined algorithms, and spent months trying to figure out how to embed this technology into user-facing products. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="speech recognition" data-type="indexterm" id="id275"/>Speech technologies, and more specifically, <a href="https://oreil.ly/GebkV">speech recognition</a>, enables machines to transcribe what humans are saying. Similarly, <a href="https://oreil.ly/7MPDk">text-to-speech synthesis</a> <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="text-to-speech (TTS) systems" data-type="indexterm" id="id276"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="TTS (text-to-speech) systems" data-type="indexterm" id="id277"/>gives computers the ability to “speak,” given written words as an input.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize at first that I had found myself at the heart of AI and innovation. This experience showed me the exciting world of AI product management.</p>

<p>The field of AI has existed for many decades. It <a href="https://oreil.ly/4MEqd">originated back in the 1950s</a>, when scientists attempted to develop computers that would emulate the way human brains work, and in particular when <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Turing, Alan" data-type="indexterm" id="id278"/>Alan Turing suggested that machines can also be taught to reason, just like humans.</p>

<p>AI is a field of computer science that gives computers intelligence. It enables machines to perform nontrivial cognitive tasks comparable to tasks humans can perform, such as reasoning, sensing, speech processing, visual perception, problem-solving, and most importantly, as <a href="https://oreil.ly/Or9Wx">Oracle notes</a>, learning from data and adapting. While <a href="https://oreil.ly/Bwv67">AI is not new</a>, hardware limitations had obscured its potential until recently. The industry is only now starting to unlock the vast potential of AI, a breakthrough made possible by leaps in chip technology, unprecedented computational power, and an abundance of data. These advancements, coupled with sophisticated algorithms and cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques, are setting the stage for AI to reach capabilities that were previously unimaginable.</p>

<p>Organizations with vast amounts of data are in a unique position to embrace AI and ML. They stand to gain a significant competitive advantage, both in their operations (e.g., predictions that inform planning, such as for restocking inventories or identifying the right price point) and in their offerings (unique, smart solutions that offer personalization, recommendations, automation, content generation, and more). Now more than ever, those organizations need professionals who can understand AI and its potential, leverage it, and “serve” it to customers.</p>

<p>Today, AI is ubiquitous. It drives increasingly complex and consequential decisions, such as college admissions and medical diagnoses. I write this in 2024, and in the past year alone, AI has advanced tremendously with the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GenAI (generative AI)" data-secondary="emergence of" data-type="indexterm" id="id279"/>emergence of<em> </em><em>generative AI</em>, a subtype of AI that produces content, sometimes abbreviated as “GenAI.”</p>

<p>This chapter introduces the business role of the AI product manager (AI PM). I’ll discuss what distinguishes this role from regular product management and what skill sets it requires. We’ll also explore the diverse landscape of AI, including how AI products leverage different AI technologies, to give you a comprehensive view of both the day-to-day work lives of AI PMs and the broader context in which they operate.</p>

<h1>The Stages of AI Evolution</h1>

<p>GenAI <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="evolutionary stages" data-type="indexterm" id="icd102"/>is often conflated with traditional AI, but in reality, it’s just one subset of a larger, more complex AI landscape. This distinction is crucial to understanding AI’s full potential, yet it’s a misconception I encounter daily. While GenAI has become a hot topic and the technology has made remarkable strides recently, it is by no means a replacement for traditional AI.</p>

<p>When we talk about “AI,” it’s important to clarify that this term encompasses a range of technologies and approaches, each with its own specific set of use cases. To assume that “AI” <em>just</em> refers to GenAI oversimplifies a vast, <span class="keep-together">multifaceted</span> field. Modern-day AI is classified into four groups: traditional, generative, general intelligence, and superintelligence.</p>


<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_1_1736793245211249">Figure 1-1</a> highlights how these four types of AI vary in scope and capability, illustrating an evolving landscape where AI ranges from specialized tasks to broader, potentially transformative <span class="keep-together">applications.</span> The diagram emphasizes the layered complexity of AI, showing how each category contributes uniquely to our understanding and advancement of intelligent systems.</p>

Let’s take a look at some examples of groundbreaking AI-powered products and how AI PMs play a crucial part in their <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="evolutionary stages" data-startref="icd102" data-type="indexterm" id="id323"/>development.</p>

<h1>How Products Leverage AI</h1>

<p>As <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI PMs (AI product managers)" data-secondary="leveraging AI for products" data-type="indexterm" id="icd116"/>an AI PM, you have the potential to transform your industry by helping your organization strategically “infuse” its products with AI to create value. To highlight the diversity of what AI PMs can work on, let’s look at a few examples of real-world transformative, groundbreaking AI products—and the role of AI PMs in their creation.</p>

<p>Google Photos<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Google" data-secondary="Photos" data-type="indexterm" id="id324"/> is an application that organizes and stores users’ photos and videos: “a home for all your photos and videos, organized and brought to life,” as <a href="https://oreil.ly/IZ8vD">Google describes it</a>. That value proposition was almost certainly conceived by the team’s AI PMs. What’s more, its <a href="https://oreil.ly/EdesI">search functionality</a> makes it easy for you to search your content using basic keywords (e.g., “dog”), without the need to pretrain the model. Simply enter the keyword, and Google Photos searches across all your photos and brings up those that contain that keyword. This feature uses multiple AI-based smart technologies, including face recognition, object detection, and scene detection, to identify and search for specific people (“Steve”), objects (“cars”), and locations or situations (e.g., “forest” or “wedding”).</p>

<p>AI PMs have also had an impact on the development of <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="autonomous vehicles" data-secondary="AI PMs and development of" data-type="indexterm" id="id325"/>self-driving cars. <a href="https://oreil.ly/j8uKS">Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta</a>, for<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tesla" data-secondary="AI PMs and development of self-driving cars" data-type="indexterm" id="id326"/> example, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="self-driving cars" data-see="autonomous vehicles" data-type="indexterm" id="id327"/>can navigate streets, change lanes safely, and even park on its own. It uses technologies such as <a href="https://oreil.ly/qhvZk">reinforcement learning</a>, an ML technique in which a machine uses its own experiences to learn by trial and error, and <a href="https://oreil.ly/LjQhV">computer vision</a>, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="computer vision" data-secondary="AI PMs and development of" data-type="indexterm" id="id328"/>which enables computers to derive meaningful information from images, videos, and other visual input.</p>

<p>Another team I worked on, Google’s augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) team, is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Google" data-secondary="Lens" data-type="indexterm" id="id329"/>developing <a href="https://lens.google">Google Lens</a>. This technology helps users understand the world around them. It analyzes everything their camera is pointing to and enables actions—for example, live translation on-screen, personalized shopping recommendations, live reviews of a restaurant, and so on. The technologies it uses include computer vision and NLP, an AI tool that helps computers understand words (in speech or written text) in similar ways to humans.</p>

<p>From launching AI-powered photo organization tools to self-driving cars and augmented reality apps, AI PMs are at the forefront of some of the most exciting developments in tech. But what makes these technologies truly innovative goes beyond just the applications: they are built on the unique characteristics of AI itself. Understanding these foundational features is key to unlocking the full potential of AI-driven products.</p>

<p>Now, let’s dive into what makes AI so distinct. Whether it’s the way AI models learn, adapt, or handle uncertainty, these unique features shape how you approach product development, decision making, and UX design. Let’s explore these features and how they impact your role as an AI <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI PMs (AI product managers)" data-secondary="leveraging AI for products" data-startref="icd116" data-type="indexterm" id="id330"/>PM.</p>

<h1>Unique Features of AI</h1>

<p>AI<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="unique features of" data-type="indexterm" id="icd106"/> has several distinctive characteristics that set it apart from traditional software and other technological tools. Understanding these unique features is crucial as you navigate your role as an AI PM. These features not only shape how AI systems function, but also impact your decision making, prioritization, and the user experiences you design. Let’s explore these features in depth, and I’ll explain what each means for you and how they influence the products you create.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Probabilistic Nature" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch01_probabilistic_nature_1736793245225482">
<h2>Probabilistic Nature</h2>

<p>AI<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="unique features of" data-tertiary="probabilistic nature" data-type="indexterm" id="id331"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="probabilistic nature of AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id332"/> models operate based on probabilities rather than certainties. Unlike traditional software, which executes predefined commands and follows deterministic rules, AI makes predictions based on patterns it has learned from data. For example, an AI system might predict with 80% certainty that an image contains a dog, but there’s still a 20% chance it could be something else entirely.</p>

<p>You need to embrace and manage <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="uncertainty, embracing and managing" data-type="indexterm" id="id333"/>uncertainty. You’ll never have 100% certainty with AI predictions, so part of your role will be to set the right expectations with stakeholders and users. Understanding the trade-offs between accuracy and other product factors such as speed or cost is key. In applications such as self-driving cars, healthcare diagnostics, and financial trading, even small errors can have major consequences, so continuously improving model accuracy becomes a critical part of your road map. We dive deep into trade-offs in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03_essential_ai_pm_knowledge_1736793246808259">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

<p>What helps me manage this uncertainty is setting up<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="feedback loops" data-type="indexterm" id="id334"/> feedback loops to consistently monitor model performance and make adjustments, and to make sure the team has strategies for model retraining, testing, and refinement. More importantly, I make sure to define interfaces that reflect the probabilistic nature of AI in smart ways; for example, with confidence scores, or with warnings when the system isn’t certain.</p>

<h2>Dependency on Data</h2>

<p>AI <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="unique features of" data-tertiary="data dependency" data-type="indexterm" id="id335"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data dependency" data-type="indexterm" id="id336"/>systems thrive on data. The more relevant, high-quality data you have, the better your model will perform. However, not all data is created equal. Bias, noise, and irrelevance in your datasets can result in skewed or flawed AI outputs.</p>

<p>As an AI PM, your success depends heavily on the quality and quantity of the data your AI model is trained on. Data sourcing, cleansing, and validation need to be key parts of your workflow. Without good data, even the best algorithms will fail to deliver meaningful results. You’ll also need to balance data privacy concerns with the desire to collect as much data as possible.</p>

<p>I de-risk this dependency by working closely with the research and data scientists to ensure that data pipelines are set up correctly and that datasets are continuously cleaned and updated. When working on AI products such as personalized recommendations or predictive analytics, you’ll need to have a strategy for acquiring both historical and real-time data. Additionally, implementing privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy can help you collect data while protecting user anonymity.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Model Drift" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch01_model_drift_1736793245225601">
<h2>Model Drift</h2>

<p>Unlike <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="unique features of" data-tertiary="model drift" data-type="indexterm" id="id337"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="model drift" data-type="indexterm" id="id338"/>traditional software that remains static unless manually updated, AI models learn and improve over time. This ability to continuously learn is one of AI’s biggest advantages.</p>

<p>However, it also introduces challenges, particularly around managing updates and ensuring that learning doesn’t introduce new biases or errors. You’ll need to think of your AI product not as a “one-and-done” release, but as a continuously evolving system.</p>

<p>Each new dataset or user interaction offers the opportunity for your model to learn and improve. But this also means you need to plan for long-term maintenance<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="maintenance" data-secondary="model drift and" data-type="indexterm" id="id339"/>, model retraining, and continuous delivery of updates. It helps to implement processes that allow for ongoing learning and improvement, such as regular model retraining schedules or active learning frameworks where the model can query for more information in cases of uncertainty. When designing user experiences, ensure that you provide a feedback mechanism so that users can correct the AI or provide additional context to improve future outcomes.

<h2>The Need for Model Interpretability and Explainability</h2>

<p>AI <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="interpretability of models" data-type="indexterm" id="id340"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="explainability of models" data-type="indexterm" id="id341"/>models, especially complex ones such as <a href="https://oreil.ly/ndyOv">neural networks</a> and <a href="https://oreil.ly/7oopf">deep learning models</a>, can be <em>opaque</em>, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="opaque AI models" data-type="indexterm" id="id342"/>meaning they make predictions or decisions in ways that are difficult for humans to understand. This “black-box” nature of AI can create challenges, particularly when transparency and accountability are critical (such as in healthcare, finance, or legal contexts). You’ll have to balance model performance with interpretability. While the most accurate models might be highly complex, they may not be explainable, which could be a problem in industries where users or regulators demand clarity on how decisions are made. The lack of transparency can also erode user trust, especially if users don’t understand how or why an AI system reached a particular conclusion.</p>

<p>I invest in interpretable AI models where possible, or I use techniques such <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="SHAP" data-type="indexterm" id="id343"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LIME" data-type="indexterm" id="id344"/>as <a href="https://oreil.ly/q-XxY">SHAP</a> and <a href="https://oreil.ly/z83re">LIME</a> to explain predictions from more complex models. For example, in a credit scoring AI, you might need to be able to explain why a particular loan was denied based on key factors, even if the underlying model is a black box. As an AI PM, you’ll also want to ensure that your user interfaces provide clear, digestible explanations for users about how AI decisions are made.</p>

This capability is transforming industries—whether it’s automating customer support with chatbots, optimizing supply chains, or navigating autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p>While automation offers massive efficiency gains, it also shifts responsibility. As an AI product manager, you need to carefully think about where to draw the line between human and machine decision making. When do you hand over full control to the AI, and when is human oversight necessary? This can vary depending on the context; automated marketing recommendations might not need human review, but medical diagnoses or legal decisions probably will.</p>

<p>You may want to design systems that allow for human oversight where necessary. For instance, you might implement a<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="human-in-the-loop approach" data-type="indexterm" id="id347"/> “human-in-the-loop” approach, where AI makes recommendations but a human user makes the final decision. Additionally, always include fail-safes and escalation protocols, especially in high-stakes environments such as healthcare and finance, where errors can have significant consequences.

<h2>Scalability</h2>

<p>One <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="unique features of" data-tertiary="scalability" data-type="indexterm" id="id348"/>of AI’s key strengths is its ability to scale rapidly. Once an AI model is trained, it can make thousands of decisions per second, far exceeding human capabilities. However, scalability brings its own set of challenges, especially when it comes to infrastructure, performance optimization, and data handling. You need to think about infrastructure from the very beginning. As your AI product grows, so too will its data processing and computational needs. AI models are resource intensive, so ensuring that you have the right cloud infrastructure or on-premises hardware to scale efficiently is critical. At the same time, scalability isn’t just about infrastructure. It’s about maintaining performance as your model handles larger volumes of data or more diverse user inputs.</p>

<p>Plan for scalability from day one. Choose cloud platforms that can scale with your AI’s needs, and ensure that your pipelines and data architecture can handle both current and future demands. You’ll also want to prioritize model optimization techniques that allow your AI to maintain its performance without requiring exponential increases in <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="unique features of" data-startref="icd106" data-type="indexterm" id="id349"/>resources.</p>

It’s a rewarding job role that requires a diverse skill set. AI PMs bring AI expertise to the product strategy table and leverage one or many of the superpowers previously discussed to create innovative, strategic AI product road maps.</p>

<p>You’re probably already familiar with the role of a product manager—let’s refer to this as a “generalist PM.” A <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="generalist PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id389"/>generalist PM helps their team and company build and launch the right product by identifying user needs and aligning them with business goals. Think of an AI PM as a supercharged version of this role. An AI PM doesn’t just ensure that the team is solving the right problem for the right user; they do so with a proactive, data-driven approach that leverages AI’s unique capabilities to create personalized, intelligent experiences.</p>

<p>As an AI PM, you won’t be expected to write code or train models. Your core focus will still be on designing world-class solutions to complex user problems. However, what sets you apart is your AI expertise, enabling you to identify where AI can add the most value, navigate its limitations and make strategic decisions regarding its trade-offs, and align AI capabilities with user needs in ways a generalist PM might not.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_figure_2_1736793245211303">Figure 1-2</a> depicts where a generalist PM sits in most enterprises: at the intersection of business, research and development, and engineering. Generalist PMs are as much a part of the engineering team as the other teams are. Their job is to identify what users need, translate those needs into technical requirements, and help the engineers build and ship the product to users.</p>

<h1>Organizational Structures</h1>

<p>An AI PM’s place in the organizational and reporting structure varies significantly from company to company. The role is so new that many enterprises are still figuring out how best to align it with their overall business, product strategies, and goals. The factors that affect this decision include the company’s size and stage (e.g., a Series A startup versus an organization with 1,000 employees), its long-term strategic goals for AI, its industry, its employees’ level of technical expertise, and how well it is set up for cross-functional collaboration.</p>

<p>If the company does not have in-house technical expertise, the AI PM may report to a third-party agency. If AI is used widely across the company, however, there might be a centralized AI product management team. In earlier-stage startups, there’s usually just one AI PM, often reporting directly to the CEO or chief technology officer (CTO). In more mature companies, AI PMs are more likely to report to a business-oriented leader, such as the vice president of product management.</p>

You might be a technical person who doesn’t have much product management experience, or a generalist PM who wants to move into AI. This book will help you develop your skills and establish a career trajectory. You might worry that you’re “too technical to be in Product” or “not technical enough for AI.” Instead, your mindset should be: “I understand enough about AI. Users are my focus, and leveraging AI will allow me to ship great products for them.”</p>

<p>The second group is AI enthusiasts who want to get into AI product management, such as recent graduates and professionals in entirely different fields. You can become an AI PM, and you’re in the right place: this book will equip you with information you will find invaluable as you navigate the world of AI-powered products. The book discusses the intricacies of AI product management, demystifying complex concepts and making them accessible for everyone.</p>

<p>The third group is people looking to recruit, hire, and manage AI PMs. Perhaps you’re creating an AI pillar in your company. This book will help you get into the mindset of an AI PM and understand the motivations and challenges of the role, as well as the skill sets you should be looking for.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="What’s Great About Being an AI PM" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch01_what_s_great_about_being_an_ai_pm_1736793245226683">
<h2>What’s Great About Being an AI PM</h2>

<p>Just like an architect designs buildings from scratch, being an AI PM means you have a vision of what your product will look like.</p>

<p>You get to set the direction and inspire your team to work together to bring that vision to life. Imagine you’ve spent months building a product from scratch. Now the work is finished, and users will be able to experience what you’ve built. The adrenaline of hitting “launch” and seeing your product come to life is like nothing else.</p>

<p>Also, you will never get bored. As an AI PM, you never stop learning—whether it’s about new technologies, large language models (LLMs), or the <span class="keep-together">nuances</span> of mental models. You can’t really stay ahead of the curve, because new curves are created all the time.</p>

<p>Most importantly, anyone is welcome in this profession, regardless of their background. There is no formal education or training required to get into AI and product management. AI involves knowledge and skills that you can acquire.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Subtypes of AI Product Management Roles" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch01_subtypes_of_ai_product_management_roles_1736793245226746">
<h2>Subtypes of AI Product Management Roles</h2>

<p>This profession encompasses a wide array of specialized roles, each focused on different aspects of building, scaling, and managing AI-powered products. Depending on the organization, the specific responsibilities of these roles may vary, but the descriptions in the following sections will provide a solid starting point for understanding the diverse roles within the field. Additionally, we’ll dive into the concepts of “0-to-1” product management (building new products from the ground up based on an AI technology) versus “1-to-n” product management (enhancing existing products with AI) because this distinction heavily influences the AI Product Development Lifecycle, as you will see in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_the_ai_product_development_lifecycle_1736793245641371">Chapter 2</a>.</p>

<p>There are three main categories of AI product managers: AI builder PMs, AI experiences PMs, and AI-enhanced PMs. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI builder PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id394"/><em>AI builder PMs</em> focus on developing foundational AI technologies and models, working closely with technical teams to ensure robust system creation. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI experiences PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id395"/><em>AI experiences PMs</em> emphasize crafting engaging and innovative user experiences powered by AI’s capabilities. In contrast, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-enhanced PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id396"/><em>AI-enhanced PMs</em> leverage AI tools into their own existing workflows, enhancing their productivity. While AI builder PMs and AI experiences PMs often follow a more sequential approach, AI-enhanced PMs span the entire product lifecycle. This book covers all three categories, providing a <a href="https://oreil.ly/bN6eo">comprehensive guide to excelling in these dynamic roles</a>.</p>

<p>AI experiences PMs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="user experiences" data-secondary="AI experiences PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id397"/> concentrate on building AI-driven features that directly enhance user interactions in consumer-facing and enterprise applications. Their work often includes crafting novel features like voice-activated commands in smart home devices, designing AI-generated playlists in music apps, or adding advanced capabilities to wearable tech such as the Oura Ring or Meta’s Ray-Ban AI glasses. This role can be more accessible to those without deep technical expertise, as it emphasizes creativity, user empathy, and a high-level understanding of AI’s capabilities. Beyond simply knowing how AI works, these PMs excel by weaving AI seamlessly into a cohesive and delightful user journey—balancing automation with user control and ensuring new features truly solve user <span class="keep-together">problems</span>.</p>

<p>Within this category, <em>ranking PMs</em><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ranking PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id398"/> oversee sorting mechanisms for content or products (e.g., search results or social media feeds), grappling with issues like relevance, fairness, and diversity. <em>Recommendations PMs</em><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="recommendations PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id399"/> build recommendation engines that personalize content, addressing challenges such as the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cold start problem" data-type="indexterm" id="id400"/> “cold start” problem for new users and the need to prevent content bubbles. <em>Responsible AI PMs</em><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="responsible AI PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id401"/> focus on ethical considerations—ensuring fairness, transparency, and compliance with regulations—while <em>AI personalization PMs</em><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI personalization PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id402"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="personalization" data-secondary="AI personalization PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id403"/> zero in on individualized user experiences, from personalized learning paths to customized news feeds. An <em>AI analytics PM</em><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI analytics PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id404"/> might work on dashboards that use predictive algorithms to deliver actionable insights in real time, whereas a <em>conversational AI PM</em><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="conversational AI PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id405"/> manages chatbots, voice assistants, or other NLP-driven experiences, ensuring smooth, context-aware interactions.</p>

<p>Some real-world job titles in this AI experiences space include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Meta: product <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Meta, jobs with" data-type="indexterm" id="id406"/>manager, AI solutions and automation (ASA), GenAI</p>

<p>To be considered for an AI experiences PM role, it helps to develop a solid awareness of what AI can (and cannot) do, highlighting any domain expertise you already possess. If you come from healthcare and want to lead an AI fitness product, for example, emphasize relevant healthcare insights while demonstrating a well-rounded understanding of AI’s limits and ethical implications.</p>

<p>On the other hand, AI builder PMs focus on foundational AI technologies and model-centric work. They often interact closely with researchers and data scientists to develop, train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models. This function can require more technical depth—especially if you’re building or maintaining the entire AI infrastructure. <em>AI infrastructure/platform PMs</em><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI infrastructure/platform PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id411"/> oversee model-training pipelines, data storage solutions, and MLOps tools, ensuring these systems are scalable, performant, and cost-efficient for multiple teams. <em>Generative<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="generative AI PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id412"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GenAI (generative AI)" data-secondary="GenAI PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id413"/> AI PMs</em> work with models like GPT-4 or diffusion models to produce text, images, or other media, tackling issues of content quality, efficiency, and ethical use. <em>Computer vision PMs</em><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="computer vision" data-secondary="computer vision PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id414"/> manage products that process visual data, from face recognition<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="face recognition systems" data-type="indexterm" id="id415"/> and AR applications to large-scale image-based searches. <em>AI security PMs</em><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI security PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id416"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="security" data-secondary="AI security PMs" data-type="indexterm" id="id417"/> build or oversee AI solutions aimed at detecting fraud or threats, where real-time response and minimizing false positives/negatives is critical.</p>

<p>Some AI builder PMs operate at the research or “0-to-1” frontier, translating groundbreaking lab discoveries into new commercial products. They set bold visions and guide early-stage, experimental projects—often navigating uncharted territory in AI. If you aspire to a builder role, the best approach is to gain hands-on experience with AI: experiment with open-source models, understand the basics of data pipelines, and learn how to deploy a proof-of-concept. Starting within your current company is often the most direct path, as it lets you build trust with engineering teams while deepening your technical expertise.</p>

<p>Some real-world job titles in this AI experiences space include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Roblox: principal<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Roblox, jobs with" data-type="indexterm" id="id418"/> product manager, foundation AI</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Scale AI: staff AI <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Scale AI, jobs with" data-type="indexterm" id="id419"/>product manager, generative AI</p>

	</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, AI-enhanced PMs use AI within their own product workflows to be more efficient and data-driven, although their product may not necessarily be AI-centric. They might adopt tools to automate competitive analyses, expedite data exploration, or improve user research—adding an AI “boost” to standard product management tasks throughout the product lifecycle. <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ch07_ai_tools_for_product_managers_1736793248032450">Chapter 7</a> expands on recommended AI tools you might want to try out.</p>

<p>Regardless of which category you fall into, the future of product management increasingly involves tapping into AI’s potential to deliver unique customer value, create more personalized experiences, and streamline development processes. By learning the right technical basics, staying curious about new AI breakthroughs, and championing an ethical approach to product design, PMs can excel in these fast-evolving roles.</p>
