   <p>While this book assumes readers are experienced Python developers, this could mean many different things. In this appendix, we look at configuring a Python development environment that will function with the code examples in this book. You can use other integrated development environments (IDEs), but not all tooling, especially extensions, will work in all IDEs.</p>

   <p>Python is provided through different versions and deployments. This book relies on the standard Python installation, version 3.10. Anaconda is another deployment of Python that is very popular and could be used. However, all the material in this book has been run and tested with a Python 3.10 virtual environment:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ol> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p11"> Go to <a href="http://www.python.org/downloads/">www.python.org/downloads/</a>. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p12"> Locate and download the latest release of Python 3.10 for your operating system. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p13"> Install the release on your machine using the instructions for your operating system. </li>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p25"> 
   <p>Thousands of extensions for VS Code can provide an excellent Python coding environment. The recommended ones are only the start of what you can explore independently. Beware, though, that not all extensions are created equally. When installing new extensions, look at the number of installs and ratings. Extensions with fewer than four stars are generally to be avoided. To install the extensions, follow these steps:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ol> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p26"> Launch VS Code, and open the Extensions panel, as shown in figure B.1.<span class="aframe-location"/> </li>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p29"> 
   <p>You’ll only need to install the extensions for each VS Code environment you’re running. Typically, this will mean installing for just your operating system installation of VS Code. However, if you run VS Code in containers, you must install extensions for each container you’re running. Working with Python in the Dev Containers extension will be covered later in this appendix.</p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p31"> 
   <p>When developing Python projects, you often want to create isolated virtual environments. This will help in managing multiple package dependencies across various tasks and tools. In this book, it’s recommended that a new virtual environment be created for each new chapter. VS Code can help you create and manage multiple Python environments quickly and efficiently via the following steps:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ol> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p32"> Press Ctrl-Shift-P (Cmd-Shift-P) to open the command panel, and select Python: Create Environment, as shown in figure B.2.<span class="aframe-location"/> </li>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p39"> 
   <p>When working with advanced agents and agents that can generate and execute code, running them in isolated containers is generally recommended. Container isolation prevents operating system disruption or corruption and provides a base for deploying agents.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p40"> 
   <p>Getting familiar with containers and platforms such as Docker can be an extensive undertaking to grasp everything. Fortunately, it takes very little knowledge to start using containers, and VS Code extensions make this even more accessible.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p41"> 
   <p>You’ll first need to install a container toolset. Docker is free (provided you use the tool as a hobby or you’re a student) and the most accessible. Follow these instructions to install Docker and get started working with containers:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ol> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p42"> Go to the Docker Desktop download page at <a href="http://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop</a>. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p43"> Download and install Docker for your operating system. Follow any other instructions as requested. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p44"> Launch the Docker desktop application. Completing this step will confirm you have Docker installed and working as expected. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p45"> Open VS Code, and confirm that the Docker extensions listed in section 1.4 are installed. </li> 
  </ol> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p46"> 
   <p>With Docker and VS Code configured, you can move on to using Dev Containers by following these steps:</p>

  <ol> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p47"> Open a new instance of VS Code. </li>
