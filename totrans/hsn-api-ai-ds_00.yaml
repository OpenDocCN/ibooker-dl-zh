- en: To succeed in AI, first master APIs. Becoming skilled at APIs is more valuable
    than ever, thanks largely to the growth of artificial intelligence, machine learning,
    and data science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But learning a such wide-ranging skill is intimidating. How is it to be done?
    You can take comfort in the fact that you don’t have to learn every skill, and
    certainly not all at once. Pick up one skill at a time through hands-on practice.
    Each skill you learn makes the next one easier, like building blocks.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re reading this book, you want to build your skills. I have found that
    the best way to do that is through hands-on coding. If you do your coding in the
    open by publishing your code in a public repository and blogging and sharing what
    you create, you can pass along your knowledge to help others. You’ll also build
    a solid portfolio of work that provides a concrete demonstration of your expertise
    to employers.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data scientists use APIs all the time, so there’s a temptation to think there’s
    nothing new to learn about using APIs. Isn’t calling an API just a few lines of
    code? It’s true that making one call to a REST API is a simple task, which is
    certainly a reason they have become so prevalent. But using an API in a way that
    is robust and resilient—and that doesn’t cause problems for the provider—requires
    more care.

    the coding examples if you have a foundational knowledge of Python. Although you
    can probably get the code to work by following the steps in each chapter, I suggest
    you begin with one of the excellent introductory Python books that O’Reilly publishes,
    such as *Introducing Python, 3rd Edition*, by Bill Lubanovic.
  prefs: []

    in Linux or Unix. You don’t need to be a Linux administrator, but you should be
    familiar with running commands in the terminal as a developer. (All the steps
    are explained, but when you run into an issue, you might get frustrated without
    some background in that environment.)

    Streamlit, Airflow, and LangChain. However, it does not address detailed topics
    necessary to run them in a *production* environment, such as security, performance,
    and infrastructure. I hope that you’ll enjoy the projects in this book enough
    that you’ll continue your learning using the references that I mention at the
    end of each chapter.

    the scenario. (You’ll hear more from him later in the book.) Fantasy sports is
    a natural playground for data scientists, and fantasy websites use plenty of APIs.
    I’ve spent many hours over the years wading into both of those as a devoted (or
    addicted) fantasy manager. Fantasy managers are also fast adopters of any predictive
    or prescriptive analytics feature the fantasy websites give them. (If you doubt
    it, you haven’t watched a manager pick up two free agents and make three lineup
    changes to push their win probability from 45% to 53%.)
