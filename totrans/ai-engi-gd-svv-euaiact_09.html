<p>Data products and their contracts are becoming popular as lightweight mechanisms for scalable data management, helping ensure that data quality is not an afterthought but a fundamental consideration at every stage of the lifecycle.</p>

<h1>Data Products</h1>

<p>Data products<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data products" data-type="indexterm" id="dp-1"/> are curated outputs derived from raw data that provide value to end users, typically in the form of insights, actionable information, or analytics. They are created through various stages of the data engineering lifecycle, including ingestion, storage, transformation, and serving. Data products can take <a href="https://oreil.ly/x9hlV">many forms</a>, such as reports, dashboards, machine learning models, or APIs.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#appendix_b_figure_1_1748539915305246">Figure B-1</a> illustrates a general structure for designing a data product using<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Data Product Canvas" data-type="indexterm" id="dpc-1"/> the <a href="https://oreil.ly/x9hlV">Data Product Canvas</a>. This framework supports scalable data governance by guiding the creation of consistent, reliable, and well-documented data products. Each data product consists of eight key building blocks:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Domain name</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Data product name</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Consumer and use case</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Data contract (more on this in a moment)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Documentation of data sources</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Data product architecture, including transformation pipelines and lineage</p>
	</li>
	<li class="pagebreak-before">
	<p>Ubiquitous language, to establish a shared understanding of terminology</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Classification of the data product (source-aligned, aggregate, or consumer-aligned)</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>A <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data products" data-startref="dp-1" data-type="indexterm" id="id674"/>critical component<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Data Product Canvas" data-startref="dpc-1" data-type="indexterm" id="id675"/> of data products<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data contracts" data-seealso="data governance" data-type="indexterm" id="dc-1"/> from a data governance perspective is the <a href="https://oreil.ly/WxikE">data contract</a>. Data contracts are formal agreements between data producers (e.g., source system owners, data engineers) and data consumers (e.g., analysts, data scientists, business users) that define the expectations, responsibilities, and standards for data exchange. They ensure that data consistently meets specific agreed-upon quality, format, and delivery requirements.</p>

<p>In their book <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://oreil.ly/M5hC9"><em>Data Contracts</em></a> (O’Reilly), Chad Sanderson and Mark Freeman define these contracts as “a mechanism for expanding software-oriented collaboration to data teams, bringing quality to data through human-in-the-loop review, just as the same systems facilitated code quality for product teams.”</p>

<p>The key components<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data contracts" data-secondary="key components of" data-type="indexterm" id="id676"/> of a data contract that will ensure effective data governance for your data product include:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Data schema</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The data contract should clearly define the structure, types, and relationships between the data fields. It should link to relevant data policies and standards and specify metadata requirements for each field.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Quality standards</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The data contract should establish standards for data accuracy, completeness, and consistency. It should also assign the roles responsible for data quality monitoring and improvement.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Delivery schedule</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The data contract should specify when and how frequently data will be delivered, ensuring alignment with established data retention policies. Include governance-approved processes for handling late or missing data.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Service level agreements (SLAs)</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The data contract should define performance metrics and response times for data delivery and issue resolution and incorporate governance-approved metrics for data availability and accessibility. It should include escalation procedures for SLA violations and processes for governance review and approval of SLA changes.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Security, privacy, and governance</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The data contract should ensure that data handling complies with relevant privacy laws and security protocols. Reference specific data classification levels as defined by governance policies and include requirements for data masking and encryption of sensitive data. Specify access control policies and procedures, data handling guidelines for different privacy classifications, and relevant compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA). Clearly define the roles of data owners, stewards, and other governance stakeholders.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Change management</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The data contract should outline procedures for managing schema changes, data source modifications, and other alterations. Include governance-approved change control procedures and specify required approvals for schema changes or data transformations. Define communication protocols for notifying stakeholders of changes and processes for updating related documentation and metadata<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data contracts" data-startref="dc-1" data-type="indexterm" id="id677"/>.</p>
