<p class="body">Why preplan your website before you start adding text and images? It’s very simple: specifying your topic, deciding on your primary goal, and creating the hierarchy for its pages informs many decisions that you make later.</p>
<p class="body">If you just jump right in and start adding content, it’s almost impossible to effectively focus the site and know what to prioritize. For most of us, that results in an unorganized and chaotic workflow. And the likely outcome is an unorganized and confusing website.</p>
<p class="body">Throughout this book, we’ll describe how to build and modify a practice site. This way, you’ll see how to apply—via real-world examples—the various concepts introduced in each chapter. However, you can just apply the concepts directly to your own website if you prefer.</p>
<p class="body">Or you can actually set up a new, empty WordPress site and work on your own version of the practice site. The appendix provides details on how to set it up if you want to build it yourself as we teach all the various skills and techniques that contribute to creating a quality website. The practice site is titled <i class="fm-italics">Time Tested Recipes for the Instant Pot,</i> and its tagline (slogan) is <i class="fm-italics">Comfort food for beginners.</i> However, we’ll also look at other use cases now and then. In this chapter, for example, you’ll see how to prepare to start building an e-commerce site for bass fishermen.</p>
<p class="body">This chapter shows you how to intelligently lay a solid foundation that will help you create a coherent, professional-looking site that you can be proud of. The very first step is to focus your site’s topic. Put another way: find a niche.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_3">3.1 Focusing your site</h2>
<p class="body">Perhaps the most common mistake beginners make when starting their first website is choosing a broad topic. It’s logical but dead wrong.<a id="idIndexMarker001"/><a id="marker-55"/></p>
<p class="body">Consider this use case. A man lives in North Carolina and frequently fishes in the Randleman Lake. He’s an expert on catching wide-mouth bass in that lake. He knows the best time of day, the best season of the year, the right weather conditions, and other details that make him a very successful bass fisherman.</p>
<p class="body">You need to choose a good title for your site. (The title isn’t the same thing as the internet address that goes in a browser’s address field [URL] to get to your site.) The title appears on the top of each page on your site. But it need not be unique like the URL must be. In WordPress, you can type in, or change, the title any time you want to by going to the Settings &gt; General screen.</p>
<p class="body">So, when deciding on his site title, our fisherman thinks: Hey, I can give really good advice about fishing here in the Randleman Lake after all these years. But just talking about this one particular lake would really <i class="fm-italics">limit</i> my audience. So, why just offer all my good tips only to the locals? There’s a whole big world of fishermen out there. I should go for that huge audience. Plus, down the road, when my site is enormous, I’ll sell them my special handmade lures too. This can be <i class="fm-italics">big!</i> I’ll just write about fishing in general and sell to a huge customer base! Wowzer!</p>
<p class="body">That’s common sense, it’s intuitive, and it’s the worst possible way to choose your title. The reason it’s so wrong is that if your site’s focus and title are <i class="fm-italics">fishing,</i> you’re in competition with 130 million other sites that also use that keyword—everything from radar scanners t<a id="idTextAnchor001"/>o toadfishing. And some of these sites are mature and popular. There’s zero chance that your site will show up if someone searches for <i class="fm-italics">fishing.</i> Most people will likely use additional keywords, such as <i class="fm-italics">North Carolina, bass,</i> or even <i class="fm-italics">Randleman Lake.</i> So our fisherman should vastly narrow his site’s topic by using keywords like this: <i class="fm-italics">bass fishing in Greensboro’s Randleman Lake.</i></p>
<p class="body">That kind of title will trigger only a couple of competing sites during a search. And if a search tool or AI judges that your site is well-crafted, you can even be the one most recommended by AI or a search tool.</p>
<p class="body">That approach—tightly focusing your title and content—is how you can increase your chances of growing a sizeable and loyal audience. After all, there are about 2 million people within driving distance of Randleman Lake. As an audience, that’s big enough.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_4">3.2 Specifying site goals</h2>
<p class="body">Some people are good at improvisation, making things up as they go along. But for most of us, it’s almost always a good idea to make a plan for a site before starting to build it. If you have too many afterthoughts, instead of growing organically, the resulting site can feel cobbled together, incohesive, ragtag, even jarring.<a id="marker-56"/><a id="idIndexMarker002"/></p>
<p class="body">So, figure out your main goal (not goals) for the site. And keep working toward that goal as you construct the site. The result is likely going to look organized, thus engendering trust and conveying quality. Whatever your goal, you want the site to look professional, not amateurish.</p>
<p class="body">First decide which <i class="fm-italics">type</i> of site you want to build. Are you going to sell things? If so, you’re building an <i class="fm-italics">e-commerce</i> site. Is the site just for your family and friends, a kind of multimedia diary of your activities, life history, or genealogy? That’s called a <i class="fm-italics">personal</i> <i class="fm-italics">blog</i> site (in that kind of site, you don’t have to find a niche—you’re it).<a id="idIndexMarker003"/><a id="idIndexMarker004"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> Most personal sites have a very limited audience of just relatives and friends. Such sites rarely attract a large audience. For one thing, they’re generally all over the place, unfocused, having no clear, single topic. A few people become <i class="fm-italics">influencers—</i>they get lucky and build an audience. But unless you’re already a celebrity, with an existing fan base eager for the details about your comings and goings, your personal blog will most likely attract few followers outside your circle. And that’s fine if you’re not concerned about generating income or building a large audience.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_5">3.2.1 The 10 types of websites</h3>
<p class="body">Websites can be grouped into roughly 10 different categories, based on their primary purpose. Of course, some sites blend two or more goals, and some sites are so unique they can’t be easily categorized, such as DudeQuote (<a class="url" href="https://www.dudequote.com">www.dudequote.com</a>)—a Big Lebowski movie quote generator. Here’s a list of the main categories:<a id="idIndexMarker005"/><a id="idIndexMarker006"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">E-commerce</i>—A site devoted to online sales. Examples include eBay, Etsy, and millions of individual sellers.<a id="idIndexMarker007"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Blog</i>—Focusing on messages posted in reverse-chronological order in a single page on the site. Some blogs encourage interactivity, allowing visitors to respond to posts. In general, a blog provides up-to-date information, as opposed to static pages that don’t change as often. Today, many sites feature a set of traditional, static pages, but also include a blog page. Such sites are called <i class="fm-italics">hybrid</i> sites.<a id="idIndexMarker008"/><a id="idIndexMarker009"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">News</i>—Sites such as BBC or CNN.<a id="idIndexMarker010"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Social media</i>—Where people can interact with friends and family, share comments and media, and join in discussions. Facebook is the most famous one.<a id="idIndexMarker011"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Forum</i>—Similar to social media, but primarily designed to answer questions or exchange information on specific, usually technical, topics such as programming. Many applications, including WordPress itself, set up forums where beginners can connect with helpful experts. Or experts can exchange ideas. A forum is usually a message board containing questions and answers. By contrast, social media tends to contain more generic content, including multimedia.<a id="idIndexMarker012"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Informational</i>—Wikipedia, our own Recipes practice site, and similar sites provide knowledge of various kinds. Some informational sites can be useful for research. But usually, the most effective resources for research are AI-powered sites such as GPT, Claude, Perplexity, and the rest.<a id="idTextAnchor002"/><a id="idIndexMarker013"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Educational</i>—Udemy and ed2go are two examples of online schools. Some offer video lessons, and others include a discussion board where students can interact with instructors. And many teachers and librarians set up small, local educational sites for their local students and patrons. For example, I teach three courses for ed2go, the online school: Blogging &amp; Podcasting for Beginners, Creating WordPress Websites, and Intermediate WordPress Websites.<a id="idIndexMarker014"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Chat Bot</i>—These AI-based systems provide information in the form of a dialog or chat. In other words, you can drill down to more helpful answers to your queries by requesting elaboration on, or revision of, previous responses.<a id="idIndexMarker015"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Portfolio</i>—Artists, writers, or others wanting to present their creations build portfolio sites. There are many excellent themes designed to show off various kinds of creative work.<a id="idIndexMarker016"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Employment</i>—A site like MonsterInsights (<a class="url" href="https://www.monsterinsights.com">www.monsterinsights.com</a>) offers resources for jobseekers, such as creating a resume, looking for openings, promoting your availability, and applying for positions.<a id="idIndexMarker017"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Government</i>—Local or national sites designed to assist with services, policies, and other government resources.<a id="idIndexMarker018"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_6">3.2.2 Five questions to answer</h3>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-57"/>Before actually starting to build your site, ensure that you’ve answered these five questions:<a id="idIndexMarker019"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">What is the purpose of your site?</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Does the site’s short-term goal differ from its long-term goal? In other words, will the site’s purpose evolve over time? For example, do you plan to grow an audience first, and then sell things later on?</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Who is the target audience?</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">What will people want to get from the site?</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">How much are you prepared to spend on a hosting service, plugins, and a theme?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">Making these basic decisions about your goal helps steer the design and content into a harmonic whole. It also helps you choose plugins, features, and functionality that will effectively support your goal. Here are some example answers to those questions for our bass fisherman’s site plan:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">The long-term purpose of my site is to eventually sell my handmade lures.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Yes, the purpose of my site will change over time. Initially I want to just attract local bass fishermen, and keep them coming back by providing up-to-date, valuable tips on how to fish Randleman Lake. But eventually I’ll add an e-commerce component to market my admittedly costly, but very <i class="fm-italics">effective</i>, lures.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">The target audience is people who fish Randleman Lake and want to catch bass instead of crappy or catfish.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">I will give my audience excellent, specific information that they can use to up their fishing game.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">I plan to get a freemium theme, use the free version for a while, and then maybe move up to the paid version when the site takes off. I’ll see if I end up needing the features of the pro version. And I’ll use the DreamHost hosting service because it’s highly recommended, but still has a low, up-front pricing plan. (I do understand that hosting services usually increase the monthly cost after an introductory period.)</p>

</ul>

<p class="fm-exercise">Here are some additional suggestions from my perspective as an experienced bass fisherman and website designer:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Emphasize your personal expertise fishing Randleman Lake specifically. Provide details on numbers of years fishing there, favorite spots, biggest catches, etc. Establish your credibility.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">For the target audience, get very niche – target serious bass fishermen who regularly fish tournaments and club events on Randleman Lake. Cater content for die-hard regulars and the casual weekend anglers will follow.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Focus on providing pro tips and advanced tactics for catching lunker bass consistently on Randleman. Go beyond basics – share your specialized, proven methods.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">On the community aspect, consider creating a Randleman Lake bass fishing forum for visitors to interact and share their experiences. This could spark ongoing engagement.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">For monetization, research affiliate programs for bass gear and boats that align with your audience. Consider partnering with local fishing guides and lodges.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Budget for paid promotions to spread awareness of your site among core targets – Facebook ads, sponsoring events, tactical SEO, etc.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Leverage your own social media presence in the bass community to promote the site. Guest post on influencer blogs too.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">Let me know if you would like me to expand on any part of the plan or provide additional tips from my experience in bass fishing and building niche websites. I’m happy to lend my expertise!</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p class="body">Finally, once you’ve figured out what type of site you’re going to build, visit other popular sites of that type. Learn from them what works, what should be included, and what functionality and design is best. Also include keywords in your title, tagline (a phrase displayed on each page, just beneath the title), and text content. Use precise and detailed keywords that people are likely to use when searching for the information your site offers such as</p>
<p class="body-ind">art resources in Boston for kindergarteners</p>
<p class="body">or</p>
<p class="body-ind">prize-winning watercolor Italian street scenes</p>
<p class="body">Notice that these search terms are <i class="fm-italics">focused</i> on fairly specific topics. And you focus by adding adjectives. I use the word <i class="fm-italics">focus</i> more than once in this chapter.<a id="idIndexMarker022"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_8">3.3 Create a hierarchy</h2>
<p class="body">If you want your site to succeed, efficient navigation is essential. People come to a website looking for something. But one thing they are <i class="fm-italics">not</i> looking for is a site so disordered that their first reaction is bafflement. If you make them feel that they have to solve puzzles to get what they came for, they’ll go elsewhere very quickly. <a id="idIndexMarker023"/><a id="marker-59"/></p>
<p class="body">You want to make the path from your home page to their goal clear and intuitive. Make sure they aren’t confused. Remember that people rarely blame <i class="fm-italics">themselves</i> when they’re bewildered. They just become frustrated with <i class="fm-italics">you</i> and your pointlessly random, complicated, and inefficient website.</p>
<p class="body">You must give visitors a mental model of your site’s structure right away. And as your site grows larger over time, a solid, logical architecture makes future modifications easier. Finally, AI bots and search engines rank you higher if they see that your site is coherent and sensible.</p>
<p class="body">In future chapters, we’ll explore ways to get feedback about how people traverse your site, where they stumble, and other data you can use to make their user experience (UX) as good as possible. But for now, let’s consider the basics: hierarchy and navigability.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_9">3.3.1 Site structure: Parent and child pages</h3>
<p class="body">Before creating your site’s pages, make a list of the topics you want to include on your site. Then arrange the list into sets: parent pages, child pages, grandchildren (if your site is quite large, grandchildren could be necessary).<a id="idIndexMarker024"/><a id="idIndexMarker025"/><a id="idIndexMarker026"/><a id="idIndexMarker027"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> Try to avoid grandchildren pages if possible (children of child pages)—people find them counterintuitive and difficult to navigate in the best of circumstances.</p>
<p class="body">Site menus normally only displays parent pages. When the visitor moves their mouse pointer onto a parent page’s name on the menu, a set of child pages drops down. This is the typical way that most visitors will navigate your site.</p>
<p class="body">For example, parent pages in our fishing site might include Lures and About Us. And child pages would be subpages of those. The Lures parent page could have four child pages: Crankbaits, Spinnerbaits, Topwater lures, and Buzzbaits. Child pages under About Us might be titled Our History and Future Plans.</p>
<p class="body">The goal here is to organize the site into five or six major parent pages, each potentially including subsidiary, subtopics (child pages are also known as <i class="fm-italics">submenus</i>). A site’s menu is a set of links to the site’s pages that is usually displayed as a horizontal bar near the top of each page.<a id="idIndexMarker028"/><a id="marker-60"/></p>
<p class="body">Let’s see how this works in practice. For example, the fishing site can include these primary, parent categories as its main menu items:</p>
<p class="body-ind">News (blog) Tips &amp; Techniques Tournaments Contact Us</p>
<p class="body">It’s desirable to keep your menu as brief as possible. So, limit yourself to no more than six parent pages, unless that sacrifices navigability. Create a descriptive, catchy site title, but note that the title isn’t the same thing as the site’s URL internet address (URL’s end in .com, .org, or some other suffix). Now consider how our fishing site could display the seven elements of a typical website page, as shown in figure 3.1.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="620" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH03_F01_Mansfield.png" width="800"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 3.1 A contemporary website page usually includes at least these seven elements: the site title, the site tagline (slogan), a banner image, the page title, the menu, the body content, and a call to action.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_10">3.3.2 Ask AI to create your page hierarchy</h3>
<p class="body">Could AI work up a first draft of a hierarchy for our example bass fishing site? Indeed, it can. <a id="idIndexMarker029"/><a id="idIndexMarker030"/><a id="marker-61"/><a id="idIndexMarker031"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> Do get used to your role when working with AI: you’re the boss; it’s an assistant, albeit far quicker than you are, gifted with an internet-size memory, light-speed thought processes, multitalented, and the list goes on. Bosses are in a position of power, but that doesn’t mean they are necessarily the brightest star in the sky. Your role as boss is to think up assignments, pass the job to AI, and then judge which of its responses are solid and which need further work. You can always request that AI try again. Or you can make improvements yourself.</p>
<p class="body">To ask AI for a page hierarchy (that is, the site menu system), it would be helpful to specify two tasks:</p>
<ol class="calibre7">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Find and list the most successful bass fishing sites.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Display an ordered list showing what those sites’ menu hierarchies have in common. These questions will help ensure that no topic is being overlooked, and will also likely generate the best, most logical overall site organization. AI is nothing if not capable of logic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="body">So, I gave this prompt to Copilot:</p>

<p class="body">This covers the bases for a bass fishing site. It includes some good topics I hadn’t thought of. However, I’d want to prune the menu down to reduce its size to only about six parent page items. For one thing, I’d move Tournaments and Membership off the menu and onto a sidebar. But why should I worry about pruning when my eager, prodigy assistant will likely do a better job? We’ll pass this menu-reduction task to AI soon.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_11">3.3.3 AI can create an entire site for you</h3>
<p class="body">Do you want AI to generate a whole new site, or at least give you a first draft to work with? Several AI-powered systems offer to do just that. Of them, 10Web (<a class="url" href="https://10web.io/">https://10web.io/</a>) is a good choice. You just give it some basic information about your intentions. Then, it does a reasonably good job of generating a real site.<a id="idIndexMarker032"/><a id="marker-63"/><a id="idIndexMarker033"/></p>
<p class="body">You’ll of course need to make adjustments and provide content, but for some people, this process will be easier than starting from scratch with an empty, blank site. 10web does tend to favor long-scroll home pages (the entire site on the home page), which I think makes navigation difficult. However, the site hierarchy, text, and images 10web generated are surprisingly good, as you can see in figure 3.2:</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="figure1"><img alt="" class="calibre4" height="565" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH03_F02_Mansfield.png" width="964"/></p>
<p class="figurecaption">Figure 3.2 This was generated from a brief, paragraph-long prompt describing our Instant Pot recipes practice site.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">These instant site builders aren’t that great at generating effective navigation, choosing the right theme or plugins, or writing useful text content. So, I would use them mainly for design ideas.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_12">3.3.4 Using menu plugins</h3>
<p class="body">As always, you can install plugins that give you additional features and options for your menu. Here are three popular menu plugins:<a id="idIndexMarker034"/><a id="idIndexMarker035"/><a id="idIndexMarker036"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">UberMenu</i>—Lets you create complex mega menus (meaning they have multiple levels and can include special content such as maps or blog post grids).<a id="idIndexMarker037"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">QuadMenu</i>—Features a drag-and-drop interface to build menus that include, for example, animations, icons, and social media integration.<a id="idIndexMarker038"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Max Mega Menu</i>—Allows you to add mega menus with widgets, transitions, and more.<a id="idIndexMarker039"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> A mega menu allows you to display grids, icons, multiple levels, transition animation effects, and other advanced features. See some examples at the Theme Junkie site: <a class="url" href="https://www.theme-junkie.com/what-is-mega-menu-examples/">www.theme-junkie.com/what-is-mega-menu-examples/</a>.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_13">3.3.5 Making the menu brief, simple, and clear</h3>
<p class="body">Each site has different menu requirements, but be sure to aim for brevity, simplicity, and clarity. (And aim for that everywhere else on the site for that matter.) Remember that people expect rapid results on the internet. <a id="idIndexMarker040"/><a id="marker-64"/><a id="idIndexMarker041"/></p>
<p class="body">And before you make your site public, it’s a good idea to ask friends to navigate your site while you watch and take notes. What throws them off? What annoys or puzzles them? What paths do they take through the site? And above all, when they leave the home page, do they go where you prefer them to go (based on your call to action)? Certainly not to a different website!</p>
<p class="body">Some say that the perfect navigation system is one where the visitor can see all of their options without having to click something or in fact <i class="fm-italics">do</i> <i class="fm-italics">anything at all.</i> Even including something as easy as hovering the mouse on a menu bar to drop and display a submenu list of child pages.</p>
<p class="body">However, it’s necessary for most kinds of websites that you divide the site into parent and child pages. You don’t want to have too much text on any of your pages. Most people don’t want to read lengthy text online. Child pages also make site navigation easier. Let your visitors get to the content they are interested in with as few clicks as possible. People sometimes want to return to a site’s home page, so it’s good to include a menu item named <i class="fm-italics">Home</i> on the far left of the menu. And, it’s customary that clicking the site title or logo also takes you back to the home page as well. Websites normally display the site title on each page (and optionally a logo image as well). These are usually found in the top-left corner of the pages.</p>
<p class="body">Main menu items (parent pages) display the primary, most general topics found on your site. Submenus are for pages or content that is subsidiary and supplemental. A child page displays additional, more specific information that expands on the content in its parent page.</p>
<p class="body">To help keep menu items as short as possible, don’t repeat your site title in the menu. For example, our book’s practice site’s title is <i class="fm-italics">Time Tested Recipes for the Instant Pot</i>. So don’t use those words when naming your menu items (or page titles). Don’t repeat <i class="fm-italics">Mexican Recipes for the Instant Pot</i>, or even just <i class="fm-italics">Mexican Recipes</i>. Your visitors <i class="fm-italics">know</i> they are looking at a site devoted to recipes for the Instant Pot, so simply name the menu items <i class="fm-italics">Mexican</i> and <i class="fm-italics">Thai</i>. The phrase <i class="fm-italics">Time Tested Recipes for the Instant Pot</i> is a given. After all, your site title is displayed on every page as a top headline, so there’s no need to repeat it in the menu.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> Technically, a hyphen is required between <i class="fm-italics">time</i> and <i class="fm-italics">tested</i> because these modifiers work together as a compound adjective modifying <i class="fm-italics">recipes</i>. That hyphenation keeps people from getting the wrong idea, such as “time recipes.” However, with headlines, punctuation rules are usually relaxed.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_14">3.3.6 Ask AI to simplify your menu</h3>
<p class="body">If you’re trying to shorten your menu, you might want to run it past AI for some suggestions. Using the bass fishing site’s menu described previously, Copilot came up with several useful ways to simplify it. After I looked at the menu Copilot created for us earlier in this chapter, I gave it this prompt: <a id="idIndexMarker042"/><a id="idIndexMarker043"/><a id="idIndexMarker044"/><a id="marker-65"/></p>

<p class="fm-exercise">Here are my suggestions for streamlining your website’s menu:</p><!--<p class="fm-exercise-break">  </p>-->
<p class="fm-exercise">Combine Similar Items: Group similar items together to reduce clutter. For example:</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">“Latest News”, “Pro Tour News”, and “Dock Talk” can be subitems under “News”.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">“Schedule”, “Results”, and “Standings” can be subitems under “Tournaments”.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">“World Rankings” and “Angler of the Year” can be subitems under “Rankings”.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">“Pro Fishing Tips”, “How-To Videos”, and “Gear Reviews” can be subitems under “Tips &amp; Techniques”.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">“General Bass Fishing Forum”, “Smallmouth Bass Fishing”, and “Fishing Reports” can be subitems under “Forums”.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">“New Products” and “Tackle Reviews” can be subitems under “Gear”.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">“Top Catches” and “Pro Diaries” can be subitems under “Videos”.</p><!--<p class="fm-exercise-break">  </p>-->
<p class="fm-exercise">Demote Less Important Items: Move less frequently accessed items to a sidebar or footer.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">For example, the “Sign In/Join Now” option is usually placed in the top-right corner or footer of a website, not in the main menu.</p><!--<p class="fm-exercise-break">  </p>-->
<p class="fm-exercise">Remove Redundant Items: If some information is repeated in different sections, consider removing one.</p>
<p class="fm-exercise">For example, if the content in “Gear Reviews” and “Tackle Reviews” is similar, you might want to combine them.</p>

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_15">3.3.7 Menu alternatives</h3>
<p class="body">Although it’s almost always best that a site provides a traditional menu, there are alternatives. Your goal is always to find the best, quickest way for your visitors to find the information they’re looking for. Every site should have a search tool on every page.<a id="idIndexMarker045"/><a id="idIndexMarker046"/></p>
<p class="body">Although most people would rather click a link or a menu item than type in a search term, you do need to provide a good way for visitors to locate highly specific information. And a search tool serves that purpose. Most themes include a basic search field, but you might want to use a specialized search plugin that would offer additional options such as drilling down, auto-completion, and perhaps thumbnail previews.</p>
<p class="body">Larger sites also often display a <i class="fm-italics">site map</i>, usually in the footer at the bottom of each page. If you think of the menu as a site’s equivalent of a book’s table of contents, a site map is like an index. It’s a lengthy, very granular, and comprehensive list of links to every topic and subtopic in the entire site. It’s also said that sitemaps can also improve your rank with Google and AI bots. For more information, see this tutorial at RankMovers: <a class="url" href="https://www.rankmovers.com/importance-of-sitemap-in-seo/">www.rankmovers.com/importance-of-sitemap-in-seo/</a>.<a id="idIndexMarker047"/></p>
<p class="body">Making a site map can help you visualize how to subdivide your site into a sensible hierarchy. After creating your site map, arrange the perhaps as many as 50 map topics into hierarchical categories within the parent and child pages.</p>
<p class="body">The best choice in many cases is to provide both the site map and the menu. For the same reason that a book with an index still has a table of contents.<a id="idIndexMarker048"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_16">3.4 Avoiding long-scroll</h2>
<p class="body">Menus clearly assist in site navigation, offering easy access to interior pages. But what if a site has only a single page? Just because something becomes popular doesn’t mean it’s a good idea. Remember all the people killed by lawn darts?<a id="marker-66"/><a id="idIndexMarker049"/></p>
<p class="body">There’s a current fad in web design where the site’s entire content is put on the home page. This can make navigating the content complicated for visitors. Scrolling isn’t the most efficient way to locate what you’re looking for.</p>
<p class="body">If there are no links to the sections in a long-scroll page, visitors must scroll down, scanning headings, to find what they’re looking for. Today’s online audience expects to use links to get where they want to go quickly.</p>
<p class="body">Proponents of the long-scroll approach argue that people prefer simplicity, and providing a menu or other links to interior pages isn’t simple. They argue that a one-page website is seamless—all the information is right there on the one page. It’s more streamlined. An additional advantage they claim is that one-page sites work well on mobile devices where menus can be less effective.</p>
<p class="body">Clearly, the long-scroll approach wouldn’t be possible on a site like amazon.com with a lot of content. Such sites must have multiple pages. And the larger the site, the more it relies on its search tool.</p>
<p class="body">But if a client or designer is insisting on a long-scroll system, there is a solution. Provide a menu that links to the various sections <i class="fm-italics">within</i> the page (called <i class="fm-italics">interior</i> or <i class="fm-italics">bookmark links</i>, as opposed to page links). I’ll show you how to link to targets within a page shortly.<a id="idIndexMarker050"/><a id="idIndexMarker051"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> Be sure to <i class="fm-italics">chunk</i> your content. People usually appreciate relatively short paragraphs, separated by images or whitespace. And your visitors also generally prefer short, clear sentences.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_17">3.5 Make good use of links</h2>
<p class="body">A menu is a set of links, but sites also employ other kinds of links—all in an effort to make traversing the site as easy as possible. A hyperlink, when clicked, jumps you elsewhere on the internet (the <i class="fm-italics">target</i> of the link). Where you jump to the link target can be a short distance, like a couple of paragraphs down a page, or as far away as the space station. In addition, links can display documents, such as a PDF file, or other media.<a id="idIndexMarker052"/><a id="idIndexMarker053"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_18">3.5.1 Links are valued by site visitors and designers alike</h3>
<p class="body">Site designers like links because they provide information in a useful way to the site’s audience, which improves the UX. They are also thought to increase a site’s search-engine rank.<a id="idIndexMarker054"/><a id="idIndexMarker055"/><a id="marker-67"/></p>
<p class="body">Because it’s often a good strategy to keep your audience on your website as long as possible, links to locations outside your site should be few. You want to keep your audience on your site until they do what you’re hoping they will do. Sign up for something, provide you with their email address, buy your merchandise, whatever.</p>
<p class="body">Links are displayed in various ways. These are the most common:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Traditional</i>—Most often an underlined and blue-colored word or phrase that describes the link’s target. A word or phrase visible to the visitor that describes the target of the link is sometimes called the <i class="fm-italics">anchor text.</i> After a link is clicked, it might change to a different color to let the visitor know they’ve already been there.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Menu</i>—Normally a horizontal set of links displayed near the top of each page in a site. The link text description is usually the same as the titles of the pages that the link sends you to.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Button</i>—Everyone understands that a button can be clicked. Sometimes, it performs an action, like submitting a contact form from a visitor to your site. Other times it can be a link to a location described in the button’s label.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Image</i>—You can display a picture or thumbnail rather than the traditional text link or a group of thumbnails as an alternative to a text menu.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Map</i>—A larger image containing multiple links within the map. It displays several locations or icons that take the visitor to different targets when clicked.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Logo</i>—Your site’s logo and title are usually links that return a visitor to the home page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">And, there are a variety of targets for links. Here are the main ones:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">An alternative view of an image</i>—Shows an image in a different way, for example, zooming a small image to page-size or displaying it in a different browser tab.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Help</i>—Shows documentation, normally in a separate tab.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Interior</i>—Jumps to a location within the same page as the link.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Ad</i>—A link that takes the visitor to Amazon or some other merchant, often providing a kickback to the site owner.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Category or tag</i>—Specialized links that only appear on the site’s blog page. They are displayed in a cluster or list, and they redraw the messages, displaying only a subset of them. For example, on a real estate site, a blog tag titled “Under $200,000” would redraw the list of posts, showing only those houses costing less than that price point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_19">3.5.2 How to create the four types of hyperlinks</h3>
<p class="body">You create a traditional link four different ways, depending on where the link target is. The link can take the user<a id="idIndexMarker056"/><a id="marker-68"/><a id="idIndexMarker057"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">

<p class="fm-head2">Linking to a page on your site</p>
<p class="body">Let’s see how this works in action as we add links to two pages in our recipes practice site: Thai Treats and Mexican Specialties. Here are the steps to link to the top of a different page in the same site:<a id="idIndexMarker058"/><a id="idIndexMarker059"/><a id="idIndexMarker060"/></p>
<p class="body-dialog">   1.  Go to your Pages &gt; All Pages screen in the backend of your site.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   2.  Double-click the title of the page where you want to place the link.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   3.  Ensure that you click to select the Visual tab in the top-right corner of the Edit Page text box.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   4.  Click your mouse within the box where you want to place the link. You’ll see the blinking insertion cursor where you clicked.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   5.  On the toolbar, click the Insert/Edit Link icon, as shown in figure 3.3.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="body">The HTML code for a link looks like this:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;a href="https://timetestedrecipes.com/mexican-specialties/"&gt;
See Some Mexican Specialties!&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<p class="body">We’ll explore this code shortly when creating a different kind of link by hand.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> In the WordPress Edit Page and Edit Posts screens, there’s a text box where you add text or media content. These text boxes have two tabs on their upper-right corner: Visual and Text. The Visual tab allows you to see the content pretty much the same as what your visitors see on the frontend of the site. However, the Text tab not only displays the content but also the HTML code that tells a browser how to display that content, such as formatting, boldface, links, page position, and so on. (Gutenberg calls the Text view the <i class="fm-italics">Code Editor</i>, which is a more accurate name.)<a id="marker-70"/><a id="idIndexMarker061"/></p>
<p class="fm-head2">Linking to an external site</p>
<p class="body">To create a link to some other site, such as YouTube, you follow the same steps as described previously when linking to a page on your site. The only difference is that after you click the gear icon (Step 6), you paste or type in the URL address of the external site (see figure 3.6). And, as always, don’t forget to click the Add Link button.<a id="idIndexMarker062"/><a id="idIndexMarker063"/></p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p class="fm-head2">Linking to a location within a different page</p>
<p class="body">Although linking to the top of a page is more common, sometimes you want to send your visitor to the third paragraph or to a particular image within a page on your site. To follow this example, add two new pages to your practice site titled Thai Treats and Mexican Specialties.<a id="idIndexMarker064"/><a id="idIndexMarker065"/><a id="idIndexMarker066"/><a id="marker-71"/></p>
<p class="body">In this example, our link target is the second paragraph in the Mexican recipes page. And the link itself is found in the Thai recipes page. (If you’re using the Gutenberg editor, add Classic blocks to your pages). Follow these steps:</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   1.  Go to the Mexican page, and create the link target by clicking the Text tab in the upper-right corner of the text box (in the Gutenberg editor, press Ctrl-Shift-Alt-M). Then, paste or type in two paragraphs of random text. We’ll create a link whose target is that second paragraph:</p>
<p class="body-ind"><i class="fm-italics">This is paragraph one. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</i> <i class="fm-italics">Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.</i></p>

<p class="body-dialog">   2.  Surround paragraph two with HTML <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code class="fm-code-in-text">&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags that tell a browser to display the enclosed content as a paragraph:</p>

Then, locate and click the URL. That opens yet another module where you can drag your mouse on the permalink to select it and press Ctrl-C to copy it. It might have been easier just to display the permalink on the Page Editor screen, but that would go against the minimalist theory that governs the Gutenberg editor UI. The theory advocates displaying by default as little information and as few options as possible. The term used is <i class="fm-italics">contextual</i>—which means only display what they think you might need at the time. So, because something like a permalink isn’t used that often, you need to drill down several levels in the UI to find it.</p>

<p class="fm-sidebar-title">Debugging HTML</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Unlike some computer languages, HTML doesn’t display error messages when you give it buggy code. It just does funny things like posting a 404 error message (page not found). Or it might just sit there and do nothing, mocking you.<a id="idIndexMarker072"/></p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Computer code is highly precise. A single wrong punctuation mark or typo, and the computer won’t understand what you’re asking it to do. This means you’ve got a bug to track down. In our previous link example, you might have copied the code from a source such as Microsoft Word that uses curly not straight quotation marks.</p>
<p class="sidebarafigures"><img alt="" class="calibre2" height="129" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH03_F10_UN02_Mansfield.png" width="150"/></p>
<p class="sidebaracaptions">There are two types of quotation marks—straight and (curly or slanted)—and HTML wants the straight ones.</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">HTML doesn’t like curly quotes. Doesn’t know what the heck they are.</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Or maybe you left out a &gt; symbol or used no quotation mark where you were supposed to include one. One way to solve bugs is to proofread the code—carefully compare your code to the code here in the book. Ensure that all is exactly the same (except of course for your URL addresses). But there is a helpful debugging tool you can also use.</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Paste your Mexican or Thai pages’ permalinks into the W3C Markup Validation Service (<a class="url" href="https://validator.w3.org/">https://validator.w3.org/</a>).</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">To show you how this works, I left out the first quotation mark in the link in the Thai page, and the validator correctly reported that this part of the code (called an attribute) is unquoted. So that was an easy fix: I just added the needed quotation mark. This error message is shown in the following figure.</p>
<p class="sidebarafigures"><img alt="" class="calibre2" height="285" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH03_F10_UN03_Mansfield.png" width="964"/></p>
<p class="sidebaracaptions">Validation can describe bugs in your HTML code.</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Then, it also correctly flagged the curly quotation marks by displaying the error message shown in the following figure.</p>
<p class="sidebarafigures"><img alt="" class="calibre2" height="289" src="../../OEBPS/Images/CH03_F10_UN04_Mansfield.png" width="972"/></p>

<p class="body">Let’s assume you have four headlines in a page. At the top of the page, you add a link to the fourth headline.</p>

<p class="body">So far, you’ve seen how to create text links. But you can make images, buttons, or other visual elements into links as well. Let’s display a button that sends your visitor to YouTube when clicked.<a id="idIndexMarker079"/><a id="idIndexMarker080"/><a id="idIndexMarker081"/></p>
<p class="body">HTML has a built-in button object, so you can make it into a link. Remember that when adding code to a page on your site, you need to be in the Edit Page screen and click the Text tab in the text box. (Or in Gutenberg, press Ctrl-Shift-Alt-M). Here’s HTML code for a button link:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;a href="https://www.YouTube.com"&gt;&lt;button&gt;Click to visit YouTube&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<p class="body">The resulting link button is shown in figure 3.11.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="body">Cascading style sheets (CSS) is a computer design language and a great tool that lets you modify and fine-tune your site’s appearance in hundreds of ways—everything from typeface to fade-in animations. In chapter 7, we’ll look at how to easily have the computer generate CSS code for you. You don’t need to learn the language at all. But for now, let’s just look at a quick sample of how CSS empowers you to polish design elements.<a id="idIndexMarker083"/></p>
<p class="body">That stark all-caps white-on-black HTML button won’t fit in very well with many—in fact, hardly any—WordPress themes. It’s unsightly. So, let’s add some CSS code to make it less severe, as shown in figure 3.12:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;a href=https://www.youtube.com/
style="background-color: lightblue;
color: gray; padding: 10px;
border-radius: 5px solid gray;"&gt;

<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> If you just use <code class="fm-code-in-text">border</code> instead of <code class="fm-code-in-text">border-rad<a class="calibre" id="idTextAnchor003"/>ius</code>, you’ll get a solid frame. Adding <code class="fm-code-in-text">radius</code>, you get a more subtle, 3-D drop-shadow effect.</p>
<p class="body">The HTML attribute’s <code class="fm-code-in-text">style</code> code is actually written in the CSS language. It works together with HTML to specify how things look. CSS can also add special effects such as animation, opacity, transition fades, and other cool visuals. Luckily for us, CSS is pretty easy to understand because, unlike most computer languages, it employs English words such as <i class="fm-italics">border</i>, <i class="fm-italics">color</i>, and <i class="fm-italics">background</i>. And, of course, you can always submit a request to Claude or one of the other AIs to generate CSS code to your specifications. You’ll learn much more about CSS, an important tool for any site designer, in chapter 7.</p>
<p class="body">That blue button is a step up from the first button, but it can still be improved. For a photorealistic button, you can<a id="idTextAnchor004"/> create an image of a button in a photo-editing application such as Paint.NET or Photoshop. Or, use an AI text-to-image application such as Midjourney. You can even purchase a button icon from Pexels (<a class="url" href="https://www.pexels.com">www.pexels.com</a>) or iStock (<a class="url" href="https://www.iStockPhoto.com">www.iStockPhoto.com</a>). Then, add that button image to your web page and make it a link. Here’s how:</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   1.  Go to the Media &gt; Add New screen and upload your button image to your WordPress media library. That’s where the images and other media that you use on your pages are stored.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   2.  Go to the Edit Page screen where you want to create the link.</p>
<p class="body-dialog">   3.  Click the Visual tab in the text box.</p>

<p class="fm-calloute"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> If you’re using the Gutenberg code editor, press Ctrl-Shift-Alt-M. That keyboard shortcut toggles you between code view and visual view. For now, you want to be in the Visual Editor mode. Then, add a Classic block to the page. If you don’t see a menu on the Classic block’s toolbar—File, Edit, View, Insert, and so on—then go to your Plugins &gt; Add New screen, and search for, install, and activate the Advanced Editor Tools plugin. On the block’s menu, choose Insert &gt; Add Media (not the Media option). Click the image you want to use from your Media Library. Click the Insert into Page button.<a id="marker-79"/></p>

You named the practice site “Time Tested Recipes for the Instant Pot” in the appendix if you set up the practice site for this book. WordPress automatically titles your home page the same as the site’s title. (Every site has a home page.) But you should change that default home page title. It’s redundant. Because the site title appears on every page, the home page shouldn’t have the same title as the site title.</p>
<p class="body">So, go to your Pages &gt; All Pages screen, and click Time Tested Recipes for the Instant Pot to open its Edit Page screen. Change the home page title to <code class="fm-code-in-text">Easy Excellence</code> or whatever you like. Click the Update button.</p>
<p class="body">Take a quick look at your Pages &gt; All Pages screen. Notice that WordPress has identified Blog as the blog page, and Easy Excellence as the front (home) page, as shown in figure 3.16.</p>

<p class="body"><a id="marker-83"/>One last job before you construct the site menu: you need to turn Tex Mex Meals and Spicy Thai into child pages. Go to Pages &gt; All Pages and double-click Tex Mex Meals. To make it a child of the Mexican Specialties parent page, locate the Page Attributes module, and then click the down arrow to drop open the parent menu. Click Mexican Specialties. Click the Update button, as shown in figure 3.17. Follow the same steps to make Spicy Thai a child of Thai Treats.</p>

</div>
<p class="body">Having populated the site with placeholders, you can now turn your attention to organizing and customizing the menu. Go to the Appearance &gt; Menus screen.</p>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-84"/>For reasons that elude me, WordPress defaults to showing only recent pages in its Add Menu Items module. Fortunately, UI blunders like this are blessedly rare in WordPress. But you should memorize this: whenever you visit the Appearance &gt; Menus screen, remember to click the View All tab first thing, as shown in figure 3.18.</p>

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 3.18 Be sure to remember to click this View All tab first.</p>
</div>
<p class="body">Under Menu Structure, type in a menu name such as Main Menu, and then click the Create Menu button. You want all your pages on the menu, so click the Select All box in the Add Menu Items module, as shown in figure 3.19 Then, click the Add to Menu button. The Menu Structure module fills with your page titles. Click to specify the Primary Menu option below this module. That positions this new menu near the top of each page. Where you can choose to locate your menu depends on the options your theme (or a menu plugin you install) offers. <a id="idIndexMarker093"/><a id="idIndexMarker094"/></p>

<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_23">3.6.2 Making child page menu links</h3>
<p class="body">Drag and drop the menu items so your menu structure looks like figure 3.20. To change a menu item into a submenu (in other words, to display it as a child page), drag it a little to the right, and then drop it so it’s indented under its parent menu item.<a id="idIndexMarker095"/><a id="idIndexMarker096"/><a id="marker-86"/></p>
<p class="body">This move takes some getting used to. In figure 3.20, notice the faint dashed frame that shows up when you drag a menu item to the right. That frame is the target where you want to drop the Tex Mex Meals subitem.</p>

<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Tip</span> If you find the process of dropping child menus one tab to the right challenging, you can instead click the black arrow icon on the right side of the child’s box to open its module. Then, click the Move Under link shown in figure 3.21.</p>

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 3.21 You might find this link easier than dropping a menu item one tab over.<a id="marker-87"/></p>
</div>
<p class="body">To complete the menu, we’ll want to shorten the menu items’ names (called <i class="fm-italics">navigation labels</i> by WordPress). For each menu item, click the black arrow icon on the right side of its box to open its module. Rename the labels like this: <code class="fm-code-in-text">Home</code>, <code class="fm-code-in-text">Chinese</code>, <code class="fm-code-in-text">French</code>, <code class="fm-code-in-text">Greek</code>, <code class="fm-code-in-text">Italian</code>, <code class="fm-code-in-text">Mexican</code>, and <code class="fm-code-in-text">Thai</code>. Menu brevity is our goal.<a id="idIndexMarker097"/></p>
<p class="body">Note that you must rename Easy Excellence to Home because that’s customary. People expect the first menu item to be named Home and to be located on the far left of the menu bar. The finished menu structure should look like figure 3.22.</p>

<p class="body">Click the Update Menu button, and then click site title Time Tested Recipes for the Instant Pot in the upper-left corner to view the menu on the frontend, as shown in figure 3.23. Recall that clicking the site title is a quick way to toggle between the backend and the frontend.</p>

</div>
<p class="body">Two things to notice here. The Twenty Sixteen theme provides two unobtrusive visual cues on the menu: the menu item of the page currently being displayed is in boldface (Home in this case), and the Mexican and Thai items have small down arrow icons, letting people know that there are child pages for those items.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">Warning</span> Nothing says “unprofessional” and “unreliable” more clearly than dead links. Ensure that all of your links actually go to real targets rather than triggering “Page not found” error messages. To test links in a small site, you can just check th<a id="idTextAnchor006"/>em manually by clicking them on the frontend. Larger sites can use the Google Search Console plugin. Or use this online checker: <a class="url" href="https://www.brokenlinkcheck.com/broken-links.php">www.brokenlinkcheck.com/broken-links.php</a><span id="idTextAnchor007"/>. We’ll explore plugins in an upcoming chapter.</p>
<p class="body">This chapter is all about preliminary planning: What’s your site’s purpose and hierarchy? And we also explored tools such as links and menus that will make it as easy as possible for your visitors to traverse the site structure.</p>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-88"/>So now that we’ve created our placeholder pages in the practice site, it’s time to fill them with content. We’ll start with text content. Most writing for the web requires a special tone and style. And as you’ll see in the next chapter, AI is great at turning your first draft into outstanding, web-ready prose. <a id="idIndexMarker098"/><a id="idIndexMarker099"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_24">Summary</h2>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">It’s quite important to establish your site’s blueprint and ultimate goal before adding content to a site. This helps you keep your eye on the site’s goal and contributes to a cohesive design and efficient site navigation.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Part of the blueprint when planning a site is creating a hierarchy with parent and child pages. This results in a simpler menu that displays only the main (parent) categories and hides the secondary (child) pages—they only become visible when a visitor hovers their mouse pointer on the parent.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Avoid long-scroll home pages—they are inefficient and can annoy visitors. Scrolling and having to scan headlines to locate what interests you is considerably clumsier than reading a menu.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Links are a key navigation tool, and using them correctly can decrease your site’s bounce rate and improve the success of your call to action.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Pay special attention to your menu, it’s a site’s primary navigation tool. Display only a few items on the menu, and keep the length of each menu item brief.<a id="marker-89"/></p>
