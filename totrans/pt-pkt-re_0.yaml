    through huge advances in technology—the invention of the personal computer, the
    dawn of the internet, the proliferation of cell phones, and the advent of social
    media. And now, major breakthroughs are happening in AI!

- en: It’s exciting to watch and be a part of this change. I think we’re just getting
    started, and it’s amazing to think of how the world might change over the next
    decade. How great it is that we’re living during these times and can participate
    in the expansion of AI?

    and AI. It’s free to download and use, and with it anyone with a computer or internet
    connection can run AI experiments. In addition to more comprehensive references
    like this one, there are many free and inexpensive training courses, blog articles,
    and tutorials that can help you. Anyone can get started using PyTorch for machine
    learning and AI.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning and mastering PyTorch can be very exciting. There’s so much to explore!
    When I first started learning PyTorch, I wished I had a single resource that would
    teach me everything. I wanted something that would give me a good high-level look
    at what PyTorch had to offer, but also would provide examples and enough details
    when I needed to dig deeper.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are some really good books and courses on PyTorch, but they often focus
    on tensors and training for deep learning models. The PyTorch online documentation
    is really good, too, and provides a lot of details and examples; however, I found
    using it was often cumbersome. I kept having to click around to learn or Google
    what I needed to know. I needed a book on my desk that I could earmark and reference
    as I was coding.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My goal is that this will be the ultimate PyTorch reference for you. In addition
    to reading through it to get a high-level understanding of the PyTorch resources
    available to you, I hope that you earmark the key sections for your development
    work and keep it on your desk. That way if you forget something, you can get the
    answer right away. If you prefer ebooks or online books, You can bookmark this
    book online. However you may use it, I hope the book helps you create some amazing
    new technology with PyTorch!
