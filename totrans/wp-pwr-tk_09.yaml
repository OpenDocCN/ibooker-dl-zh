    resulting in a commission if your visitor clicks a link that takes them to something
    to purchase. This kind of marketing comes in two versions: pay-per-sale (PPS)
    and pay-per-click (PPC). With PPS, you earn money only if there is a sale. This
    is the most common version and can also be the more rewarding. With PPC, you get
    paid when someone just clicks on the affiliate link, regardless of whether there
    is a sale. A variant of PPC is pay-per-lead (PPL), where you’re paid if someone
    just signs up for a newsletter, fills out a form, joins a website, or other similar
    results.'

    irritating your audience. The worst offenders are pop-up ads. These intrusive
    ads cover site content until they are either ready to go away automatically or
    are closed by the user. Some pop-ups aren’t that easy to close because they don’t
    display an x for a while, or they hide it in unusual locations (the upper-right
    corner is where people expect to find the x in Windows). This kind of forced interaction
    can be exasperating. Some pop-ups even open a new browser tab. Most browsers,
    however, do feature pop-up blockers.

    •   Consolidate Navigation: The top navigation bar is quite busy with multiple
    tabs, buttons, and services. Simplifying this area could help visitors find what
    they need faster and with less distraction.    •   Simplify Design Elements: The
    site uses a variety of colors, fonts, and button styles. A more unified design
    scheme could be less visually overwhelming and more pleasing.    •   Streamline
    Content: There are multiple sections on the page advertising different categories
    and occasions. Condensing these into a more streamlined, easy-to-navigate format
    could improve user experience.    •   Limit Animated Elements: If any of the images
    or banners are animated, they should be used sparingly as they can be distracting
    and slow down site loading times.    •   Improve Advertisement Integration: Ads
    from partners are prominently featured and could be integrated more seamlessly
    into the site’s layout so as not to appear too distinct from the site’s own content.   
    •   Optimize for Mobile: Ensure that the site is responsive and that any advertisements
    do not overwhelm the content on smaller screens.    •   Reduce Pop-Ups and Overlays:
    If there are any pop-up ads or overlays that are not visible in the screenshot,
    these should be used minimally as they can be particularly intrusive.    •   Balanced
    Placement of Partner Logos: The logos of partner sites could be made smaller and
    placed in a less central location so as not to compete with the site’s own content.   
    •   Focus on User Experience: Overall, the goal should be to create a balance
    where advertisements are present but do not take away from the core purpose of
    the site, which is to help users find gifts easily. |'

    that is unobtrusive and subtle is a great approach. Here are some tips to do this
    effectively:    •   Relevant Ad Content: Make sure the ads are relevant to your
    audience. Ads related to fishing gear, outdoor apparel, local fishing tours, or
    conservation efforts would be more interesting to your readers and less likely
    to be seen as intrusive.    •   Ad Placement: Place ads in areas where they don’t
    disrupt the reading flow. Common places include the sidebar, header, or footer
    of your blog. Avoid placing ads in the middle of your articles as this can be
    disruptive.    •   Limit Pop-Ups and Auto-Play Media: Avoid pop-up ads or auto-play
    videos with sound as they can be particularly annoying and might deter visitors
    from returning to your site.    •   Use Ad Networks Wisely: Choose an ad network
    that allows you to control the types of ads displayed. Networks like Google AdSense
    are popular and offer some level of control over ad content.    •   Monitor Ad
    Frequency: Don’t overload your page with ads. Too many ads can make your site
    look cluttered and distract from your content.    •   Transparency: Be transparent
    with your audience about using ads. A brief mention that ads support your blog
    can make your readers more receptive to them.    •   Test and Get Feedback: After
    implementing ads, ask for feedback from your regular visitors. This can provide
    valuable insights into how your audience perceives the ads and whether they find
    them intrusive.By following these guidelines, you can integrate ads into your
    blog in a way that respects your visitors’ experience while also providing a source
    of revenue for your blog. |'

    should be visually striking, so they notice that something needs to be done. It

    otherwise activates it. And you should let them see a benefit, or create a sense

    and winning them over as clients or customers. A CTA is usually an attention-grabbing
    element, such as a button with a dramatic color or shape. Also, use language that
    calls for action, like “Buy Now,” “Learn More,” or “Sign Up.” Because CTAs directly
    affect user engagement and *conversion rates*, the performance of an e-commerce

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In e-commerce and digital marketing, a *conversion rate* is the proportion of
    website visitors who do what you hope they’ll do. This depends of course on the
    goals you have in mind. It could be purchasing something, subscribing to a newsletter,
    downloading a resource, booking an event, or any other key performance indicator
    (KPI).
  prefs: []

    important goals. In the context of website conversion rate, KPI is a metric to
    help you see how well your site converts users into customers or leads.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To find the conversion rate as a percentage, divide the total number of visitors
    by the number of conversions. Then, multiply the result by 100\. A website with
    2,000 visitors per month and 100 purchases, for instance, would have a conversion
    rate of (100 ÷ 2000) × 100 = 5%.

    terms of marketing. A low conversion rate means that you should perhaps improve
    the website’s content, user experience (UX), design, or CTA.
