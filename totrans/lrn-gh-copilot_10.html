<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub, using Copilot in" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_GitHubusingCopilotin944"/>Like many other key software development tools, AI has been integrated into the GitHub ecosystem through Copilot. This means you can chat with Copilot directly in GitHub as well as use the AI capabilities to work directly with key functionality like pull requests and issues.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we’ll survey how Copilot has been integrated into GitHub and explain how you can effectively leverage its power when working in GitHub. We’ll cover the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Using Copilot Chat with GitHub repositories</li>
	<li>Using Copilot for change workflows</li>
	<li>Copilot and pull requests</li>
	<li>Copilot and GitHub issues</li>
</ul>

<h1>GitHub Interface over Time</h1>

<p>As with all information in this book, screenshots and information about what items are present and where they are located is current at the time of writing. Like Copilot integration in the IDEs, integration in GitHub may evolve over time.</p>
</div>

<p>To get started, let’s explore how Copilot is integrated with your repositories in <span class="keep-together">GitHub</span>.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Using Chat with GitHub Repositories"><div class="sect1" id="id98">
<h1>Using Chat with GitHub Repositories</h1>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub repository" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_GitHubrepositoryusingchatwith9274"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Copilot Chat" data-secondary="using with GitHub repositories" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_CopilotChatusingwithGuitHubrepositories9274"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="repositories" data-secondary="GitHub" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_repositoriesGitHub9274"/>A chat interface like the ones available in IDEs that integrate with Copilot is also available in GitHub. There is a general one at <a data-type="link" href="https://github.com/copilot"><em>https://github.com/copilot</em></a>. Also, on the Code page of your repositories, you’ll see a Copilot icon in the top row of controls (as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#copilot-icons-in-repo">Figure 9-1</a>). Clicking the icon will take you to an immersive (full-screen) Copilot chat interface for that project. We’ll circle back to that in a moment.</p>

<p>Clicking the drop-down arrow next to the Copilot icon brings up a menu of choices (also shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#copilot-icons-in-repo">Figure 9-1</a>). Of these, the one we’re interested in is the Assistive option.</p>

<figure><div id="copilot-icons-in-repo" class="figure"><img alt="" src="assets/lghc_0901.png" width="1440" height="857"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-1. </span>Copilot icons in a repository page</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Clicking the Assistive menu option brings up a chat interface, pre-populated with suggested questions you can ask about the selected repository, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#repository-questions2">Figure 9-2</a>.</p>

<figure><div id="repository-questions2" class="figure"><img alt="" src="assets/lghc_0902.png" width="1440" height="1157"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-2. </span>Repository questions in the assistive chat</h6>
</div></figure>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note">
<h1>Chat Context in GitHub</h1>

<p>New assistive chat instances will be populated with questions relevant to the active GitHub item when the chat is opened. For example, if you are working on a GitHub issue and open a new chat instance, the chat instance will be populated with questions like “Summarize this issue” and “What are the next steps?” Selecting one of these pre-populated questions will fill in a much longer prompt, tailored to specifically get better information.</p>
</div>

<p>Choosing the first question, which asks Copilot to tell you about this repository, queries Copilot with a ready-made prompt, as shown here:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" translate="no">
Please provide answers to the following questions in separate 
paragraphs:

 - Provide insights on the purpose of this repository. Please also 
provide a summary of its README if it exists. 
 - Provide detailed analysis on features and technologies used in 
this repository if it contains implementation of software system of
 any kind. Otherwise, provide an analysis on contents of this
 repository instead. 

Additional guidance: 
 - Provide a heading for each paragraph, formatted in bold.
 - Keep your analysis succinct and conversational.
 - Do not repeat or list the context details in your final response.
 - Provide a concise synthesis of the information, avoiding 
unnecessary repetition.
</pre>

<p>Copilot’s response to the prompt looks like this:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" translate="no">
Purpose of the Repository

This repository provides a basic example of implementing a
Kubernetes operator. It serves as a training resource for 
creating Kubernetes operators using standard toolkits. 
The README explains how to set up and run the operator, 
including steps for deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster, 
testing it, and modifying its API definitions. The project adheres
to Kubernetes' Operator pattern, aiming to synchronize resources
to their desired state.

Features and Technologies Used

The repository is built using Go and utilizes Kubernetes operator
development principles. It leverages Kubebuilder to create 
controllers that follow the Kubernetes Operator pattern. The 
operator interacts with Kubernetes clusters, managing Custom 
Resource Definitions (CRDs) and ensuring the cluster state matches
the desired configuration. Additionally, the repository provides
Makefile targets for tasks such as building, deploying, and 
uninstalling the operator.
</pre>

<p>This type of information can be especially useful for someone onboarding or needing to assume responsibility for this codebase.</p>

<p>When interacting, if you prefer an immersive chat experience, you can click the square icon in the upper right to be taken to a full-screen chat session. The immersive option resembles the IDE chat interface, with the repository set as the default context. The immersive option is the same screen you get if you just click the Copilot icon (rather than the arrow next to it) shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#copilot-icons-in-repo">Figure 9-1</a>.</p>

<p>Clicking the icon or going from the Assistive screen to the Immersive one both open <a data-type="link" href="https://github.com/copilot"><em>https://github.com/copilot</em></a>. The chat interface on that page will have the current repository set as the default context. <a data-type="xref" href="#immersive-chat">Figure 9-3</a> shows the immersive/default screen for Copilot Chat in GitHub.</p>

<figure><div id="immersive-chat" class="figure"><img alt="" src="assets/lghc_0903.png" width="1445" height="1199"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-3. </span>Immersive chat</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>The controls in the main text entry area of the dialog operate nearly the same as the controls in the corresponding area in the IDE chat dialog. One difference is that the Submit arrow button does not have any additional options since we don’t have chat participants or other elements to submit the query to.</p>

<p>It’s worth spending a few minutes to talk about the other controls and options available in the chat dialog in GitHub. (Some of these may not be visible unless you’re in the immersive view.)</p>

<p>The control in the upper left that looks like a square with a strip and right-pointing arrow in it is for opening previous or existing conversations. Clicking this shows a list of all separate conversations you’ve had in this chat and allows you to select and switch between them.</p>

<p>The next icon to the right that looks like a square with a pencil in it opens up a new conversation.</p>

<p>The control on the far right is identified as <em>Open Workbench<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Open Workbench" data-type="indexterm" id="id853"/></em>. At the time of this writing, there doesn’t seem to be any real documentation on what this feature is supposed to do.</p>

<p>Another control shows up after you enter your first prompt in a chat conversation: the Share button. This button makes it simple to share a Copilot chat for purposes like peer coding/troubleshooting, adding insights into a pull request, etc.</p>

<p>To share the current conversation and future messages, you click the Share button in the upper right and then click Share again in the dialog that comes up (<a data-type="xref" href="#share-operation">Figure 9-4</a>).</p>

<figure><div id="share-operation" class="figure"><img alt="" src="assets/lghc_0904.png" width="1442" height="1125"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-4. </span>A share operation</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>After this, you can click the drop-down arrow next to the Share button and copy the link for the shared conversation to provide to others (<a data-type="xref" href="#getting-share-link">Figure 9-5</a>). You can also unshare if you want.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-5. </span>Getting the share link</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Finally, the Menu control (represented as three dots) to the right of that brings up a menu for accessing advanced functionality, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#chat-menu">Figure 9-6</a>.</p>

<figure><div id="chat-menu" class="figure"><img alt="" src="assets/lghc_0906.png" width="886" height="928"/>

	<dt>Conversation</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Conversation option" data-type="indexterm" id="id854"/>The items in this section are self-explanatory, allowing you to rename, delete, or share the current conversation.</p>

	<dd>
	<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Personal Instructions option" data-type="indexterm" id="id855"/>These let you customize the way Copilot Chat responds to you on GitHub. Clicking this brings up a dialog where you can specify preferences like language, tone, or coding style (e.g., “Always answer in Python” or “Be concise”). These instructions override any repository or organization-level settings and apply to all your Copilot Chat sessions on GitHub.</p>

<p>The chat interface is our gateway for conversing with the AI about the repository, but it is also a trigger for the repository to be indexed. We’ve discussed how indexes are created and used in the IDE with Copilot. Separate indexes are created for repositories on the GitHub side. The goal, however, is the same: provide Copilot with a much deeper, richer understanding of the repository. The way indexing works for GitHub repositories is described in more detail in the following sidebar.</p>

<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="id860">
<h1>Indexing in GitHub</h1>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="indexing" data-type="indexterm" id="id861"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="indexing in" data-type="indexterm" id="id862"/>When you open GitHub Copilot Chat in a repository on GitHub, the repository is automatically indexed in the background. This process enables Copilot Chat to provide context-aware answers about your codebase, such as explaining code structure or logic, referencing relevant sections of your repository. No manual step is required to trigger this indexing—simply opening Copilot Chat with the repository selected as context will start the process.</p>

<p>Here are some key points about indexing:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Automatically triggered</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Indexing starts automatically when you open Copilot Chat with a repository context on GitHub.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Speed</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The initial indexing is fast, typically taking only a few seconds to a minute, even for large repositories.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Continuous updates</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Once indexed, the repository’s index is kept automatically up-to-date, typically within seconds of starting a new conversation.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>No indexing limits</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>There are no limits to the number of repositories you can index, and this applies to all Copilot subscription levels, including the free tier.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>No model training</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The indexed data is not used for model training; it is used only to improve Copilot’s ability to answer questions about the code in your repository.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Access control</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Only users with access to the repository can benefit from its indexed context in Copilot Chat.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>
</div></aside>

<p>The chat interface and indexing functionality are useful for understanding and diving deeper into learning about repositories and other objects in GitHub. This can be beneficial for those needing to onboard to a new project or assume responsibility for making changes and fixes.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to working with changes and fixes in GitHub, we can leverage Copilot in other ways to make our coding workflows more efficient and less time-consuming<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_GitHubrepositoryusingchatwith9274" data-type="indexterm" id="id863"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_CopilotChatusingwithGuitHubrepositories9274" data-type="indexterm" id="id864"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_repositoriesGitHub9274" data-type="indexterm" id="id865"/>.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Using Copilot for Change Workflows"><div class="sect1" id="id99">
<h1>Using Copilot for Change Workflows</h1>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="using for change workflows" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_GitHubCopilotusingforchangeworkflows91844"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="change workflows, using Copilot for" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_changeworkflowsusingCopilotfor91844"/>Copilot provides useful capabilities for code changes—from proposing fixes and helping update issues and pull requests to reviewing code. In this section, we’ll take an example of a problem and see all the ways we can put Copilot to use in helping us correct it.</p>

<p>To start, we’ll use an example security issue. We have code with a set of database queries that are vulnerable to SQL injections because of the way they are constructed. This sort of issue can be identified easily with GitHub’s code scanning done through its <a href="https://codeql.github.com">CodeQL application</a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="CodeQL application" data-type="indexterm" id="id866"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="applications" data-secondary="CodeQL" data-type="indexterm" id="id867"/>.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Code-scanning alerts from a problematic repository are shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#a-set-of-issues-in-co">Figure 9-7</a>.</p>

<figure><div id="a-set-of-issues-in-co" class="figure"><img alt="" src="assets/lghc_0907.png" width="1241" height="896"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-7. </span>A set of issues in coding scans</h6>
</div></figure>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Let’s pick one of these problems to work with. We’ll use the last one. Opening up the link from the “Code scanning” panel, we see more details about the particular alert (<a data-type="xref" href="#code-scanning-alert">Figure 9-8</a>).</p>

<figure><div id="code-scanning-alert" class="figure"><img alt="" src="assets/lghc_0908.png" width="1301" height="702"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-8. </span>Code-scanning alert</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>It would be nice if we could have Copilot summarize this alert for us. Unfortunately, Copilot doesn’t have this capability at the time of this writing. However, we do have a button provided in the same screen to create an issue (as seen in the top right of <a data-type="xref" href="#code-scanning-alert">Figure 9-8</a>).</p>

<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning">
<h1>Enabling Issues</h1>

<p>The Create issue<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Create issue button" data-type="indexterm" id="id868"/> button will be available only if Issues have been enabled in the repository’s Settings.</p>
</div>

<p class="pagebreak-before">If we click the Create issue button, we’ll get a basic GitHub issue created with a title and a link to the scanning alert, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#generated-draft-for-i">Figure 9-9</a>. (A warning also results, which is useful, but it’s not a concern for what we’re doing in this example.)</p>

<figure><div id="generated-draft-for-i" class="figure"><img alt="" src="assets/lghc_0909.png" width="918" height="787"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-9. </span>A generated draft for the issue</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Clicking the Submit new issue<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Submit new issue button" data-type="indexterm" id="id869"/> button will complete the initial issue creation (<a data-type="xref" href="#generated-issue">Figure 9-10</a>).</p>

<figure><div id="generated-issue" class="figure"><img alt="" src="assets/lghc_0910.png" width="934" height="749"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-10. </span>The generated issue</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>After this, if we return to the alert page (<a data-type="xref" href="#ch8-alert-page-detail">Figure 9-11</a>), we can see that it reports that it is “Tracked by #3”. The #3 refers to GitHub issue #3 in this repository.</p>

<p>You may have also noticed the banner in the box underneath that mentions “Copilot Autofix for CodeQL” along with a Generate fix<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Generate fix button" data-type="indexterm" id="id870"/> button. <em>Copilot Autofix<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Copilot Autofix" data-type="indexterm" id="id871"/></em> is a feature that integrates with GitHub’s code-scanning tools (like CodeQL<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="CodeQL application" data-type="indexterm" id="id872"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="applications" data-secondary="CodeQL" data-type="indexterm" id="id873"/>) to analyze your code, identify issues, and create fix suggestions using Copilot.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-11. </span>Alert page detail</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Clicking the Generate fix button causes Copilot to produce suggested code changes to correct the issues, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#suggested-fix-from-co">Figure 9-12</a>.</p>

<figure><div id="suggested-fix-from-co" class="figure"><img alt="" src="assets/lghc_0912.png" width="830" height="794"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-12. </span>A suggested fix from Copilot</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>At the end of the suggested code changes is a Commit change<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Commit change button" data-type="indexterm" id="id874"/> button. Clicking it sets up a push to a new branch (by default) with autogenerated entries for the branch name and commit message. To ensure this is tied back to the issue we opened for this change, we’ll add the extended description <code>fixes #3</code>. The commit dialog is shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#commit-setup-for-auto">Figure 9-13</a>.</p>

<figure><div id="commit-setup-for-auto" class="figure"><img alt="" src="assets/lghc_0913.png" width="846" height="699"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-13. </span>Commit setup for autofix</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Completing the commit automatically opens a draft pull request that includes running the CodeQL tool again to verify whether the issues are fixed (passing status). In the next section, we’ll dive a little deeper into how Copilot can help us with managing pull requests like the one for this change<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_GitHubCopilotusingforchangeworkflows91844" data-type="indexterm" id="id875"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_changeworkflowsusingCopilotfor91844" data-type="indexterm" id="id876"/>.</p>
</div></section>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Using Copilot with Pull Requests"><div class="sect1" id="id100">
<h1>Using Copilot with Pull Requests</h1>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="using with pull requests" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_GitHubCopilotusingwithpullrequests92464"/>GitHub pull requests are a tried-and-true method of managing merges in GitHub among multiple repositories or between branches in the same repository. The pull requests offer a means of collaboration to consolidate and vet changes from the source. They also insulate the merge target from bad code by facilitating gates like code reviews and runs of GitHub Actions workflows.</p>

<p>But they’re not without their challenges. One of those challenges can be getting and understanding the collection of changes and conversations that are happening in a pull request as it is being worked on. Fortunately, Copilot can provide some help.</p>

<p>Let’s pick up with our previous example of security vulnerabilities within our repository that have been addressed in another branch. We now want to merge these fixes back to our production branch (<em>main</em> in this case) by using the pull-request process.</p>

<figure><div class="figure"><img alt="" src="assets/lghc_0914.png" width="1130" height="793"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-14. </span>Draft pull request from autofix</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>When we’re ready, we can change the draft pull request into one that’s ready for review by clicking the “Ready for review<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Ready for review button" data-type="indexterm" id="id877"/>" button. After that, we can go through the usual pull-request processes including adding reviewers.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Having Copilot Review Pull Requests"><div class="sect2" id="id101">
<h2>Having Copilot Review Pull Requests</h2>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pull requests, using Copilot with" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_pullrequestsusingCopilotwith92614"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="reviewing" data-secondary="pull requests" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_reviewingpullrequests92614"/>Copilot itself can be added as an automated reviewer to provide feedback on changes. Here’s what that looks like. In the Reviewers section of the pull request, you simply click the user area and you’ll see Copilot shown as a reviewer option (<a data-type="xref" href="#adding-copilot-as-a-r">Figure 9-15</a>).</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-15. </span>Adding Copilot as a reviewer on the pull request</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>After Copilot has time to review the code, it will post results back to the pull request, as seen in <a data-type="xref" href="#copilots-review">Figure 9-16</a>. In this instance, Copilot had no feedback to offer. This makes sense since Copilot also produced the suggested fix originally.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-16. </span>Copilot’s review</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>At this point, we’re ready to merge the pull request. As a final check, or if we needed to provide an explanation to someone else, we can also ask Copilot to summarize this pull request. We have the buttons to open Copilot chat at the top of the page and also one that is <em>floating</em>, usually toward the bottom right (<a data-type="xref" href="#multiple-ways-to-open">Figure 9-17</a>).</p>

<figure><div id="multiple-ways-to-open" class="figure"><img alt="" src="assets/lghc_0917.png" width="727" height="389"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-17. </span>Multiple ways to open Copilot chat</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>You can select one of these to open a chat session. With the session open, we can ask Copilot for tasks related to the pull request, such as “Summarize this pull request” (<a data-type="xref" href="#ch8-asking-copilot-to-sum">Figure 9-18</a>).</p>

<figure><div id="ch8-asking-copilot-to-sum" class="figure"><img alt="" src="assets/lghc_0918.png" width="970" height="759"/>

<p>Copilot produces a short summary of the pull-request content that is easily consumable (<a data-type="xref" href="#copilot-summary-of-pu">Figure 9-19</a>).</p>

<h2>Leveraging Copilot to Simplify Initiating Pull Requests</h2>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="initiating pull requests" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_initiatingpullrequests92974"/>Assume that in the same repository we’ve been working in, we create and push fixes for <em>all three</em> alerts into a different branch named <em>dev</em>. Suppose we want to create a new pull request to merge the <em>dev</em> branch into <em>main</em>.</p>

<p>We could certainly go through the pull requests menu and follow the steps to create another one. However, with Copilot, we can simplify that process down to a single click. Since most locations and operations in GitHub can be done via visiting a URL, we can ask Copilot to generate a suitable URL for us. To do that, we can open up the Copilot chat interface and use a prompt like the following:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" translate="no">

<p class="pagebreak-before">With the link conveniently generated, we can click it to open up the new pull request with the <em>base</em> and <em>compare</em> components already set up as needed. But beyond just making it easier to create the pull request, we can also have Copilot generate a summary for it based on the changes. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch8-pull-request-generate">Figure 9-21</a> shows how to do this by clicking the Copilot icon in the description area and then selecting the item to generate a summary.

If we want to further explore a change or set of changes in a file, we can click those links or switch directly to the “Files changed”<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Files changed tab" data-type="indexterm" id="id883"/> tab to view the differences (<a data-type="xref" href="#files-changed-in-the">Figure 9-23</a>).</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-23. </span>Files changed in the pull request</h6>
</div></figure>

<p class="pagebreak-before">In this tab of the pull request are two links to open Copilot. The one in the lower right is the standard one that opens up a Copilot Chat interface. The one at the top labeled Ask Copilot (next to the “Review changes” button) automatically attaches the current file to the chat context and opens the chat dialog (<a data-type="xref" href="#ch8-dialog-from-ask-copil">Figure 9-24</a>).</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-24. </span>Dialog from Ask Copilot</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Adding the file as context sets up the context for any subsequent prompts in this dialog to be answered based on the file <em>models.go</em>. For example, you can ask Copilot in this dialog to “Summarize the changes in this file,” resulting in it giving you info on the file used with the context (<a data-type="xref" href="#file-changes-from-con">Figure 9-25</a>).</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-25. </span>File changes from the context of Ask Copilot</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>There is also a third, sometimes hidden, Copilot access link in a file diff like this. If you scroll up near the start of the selected diff, you will see a small, floating Copilot icon with a drop-down arrow next to it. Clicking this icon gives you two options, Explain and Attach to current thread<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Attach to current thread option" data-type="indexterm" id="id884"/> (<a data-type="xref" href="#ch8-additional-copilot-op">Figure 9-26</a>).</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-26. </span>Additional Copilot options for the diff</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>The Explain option is similar to what we’ve seen before with Copilot’s explain functionality. The Attach to current thread option allows us to set this specific diff as the context for Copilot chat. For example, if we select the Attach to current thread option referencing the diff shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch8-additional-copilot-op">Figure 9-26</a>, then when we next open the chat dialog for Copilot, we can see that it is referencing the single change starting at line 33 as the context rather than the entire file (<a data-type="xref" href="#diff-specific-context">Figure 9-27</a>).</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-27. </span>Diff-specific context</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>It’s worth noting that we can click Conversation options (displayed as three dots) in the upper right of the diff window to also access some Copilot functionality (<a data-type="xref" href="#copilot-from-menu">Figure 9-28</a>).</p>

<p>Both options add the file to the chat context as the Ask Copilot button<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Ask Copilot button" data-type="indexterm" id="id885"/> does.</p>

<p>Lastly in this chapter, let’s look at how Copilot can assist with another common GitHub coding aid: GitHub issues<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_GitHubCopilotcodechangeswith93364" data-type="indexterm" id="id886"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_codechangeswithCopilot93364" data-type="indexterm" id="id887"/>.</p>

<h1>Using Copilot with GitHub Issues</h1>

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="using with GitHub issues" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_GitHubCopilotusingwithGitHubissues93784"/>Copilot has built-in functionality to also summarize GitHub issues. It does this by using tools (like GitHub’s own APIs) to parse the issue’s content. This includes the issue’s body, title, comments, and even linked pull requests (if they exist). The goal is to create a summary overview of the main points you need to be aware of. Depending on the extent of information available in the issue, the summary will typically include the primary problem, the components that are affected, what the functionality should be, and potential fixes.</p>

<p>These summaries provide the following benefits:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Time savings</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Allowing you to quickly understand the core points of an issue without having to spend inordinate amounts of time dealing with long discussions</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Better communication</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Providing clear summaries to go along with related tasks or updates at all levels</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Efficient triage</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Allowing for better prioritization of GitHub issues based on clarity of severity and impact, and fix complexity surfaced through the summary</p>

Copilot’s issue summaries may miss some nuances and/or details that might be important.</p>
</div>

<p>Let’s work with an issue related to the database query security problem we were using in the preceding section. We can bring up the GitHub Copilot chat screen and provide prompts to get information or help with the issue. <a data-type="xref" href="#asking-copilot-to-sum">Figure 9-29</a> shows an example of prompting Copilot to Summarize this issue.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-29. </span>Asking Copilot to summarize an issue</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>We can prompt for more details, ask about the main points, or even get Copilot to suggest next steps. <a data-type="xref" href="#suggest-next-steps-fo">Figure 9-30</a> shows an example of asking Copilot to “Suggest next steps for this issue.”</p>

<p>Since generative AI is not deterministic, the quality of the response can vary significantly in terms of detail.

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Conclusion"><div class="sect1" id="id105">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>In this chapter, we’ve covered the various integration points that Copilot has with the GitHub web interface. By having this direct integration, Copilot’s utility is greatly extended and readily available when working with repositories and common GitHub mechanisms such as issues and pull requests.</p>

<p>The integration with GitHub is done mostly through Copilot’s chat interface. A GitHub repository has multiple places to invoke the chat dialog and converse with Copilot by using natural language. If you are working on an issue, a pull request, or a fix and start up a new Copilot chat session, Copilot can identify that as the context and offer relevant questions as a starting point.</p>

<p>For more specific responses tailored to one or more files, you can add files as context in a chat. When looking at a change in a pull-request code diff, you can also add individual files or even tell Copilot to reference only part of a file with a particular fix when it generates its responses.</p>

<p>Copilot can also summarize changes made in a pull request as an overall set of comments. Those summary comments will include links to specific changes and allow you to reduce the work of creating a pull request. It can also assist with summarizing and answering questions based on GitHub issues.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that Copilot can be added and participate as a reviewer on pull requests. Acting as an automated reviewer, Copilot can provide feedback and suggestions in the body of the pull request just as a human reviewer would do.</p>

<p>In the next chapter, we’ll look at how to extend the functionality of Copilot and integrate other tools with it through creating Copilot Extensions<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_GitHubusingCopilotin944" data-type="indexterm" id="id891"/>.</p>
