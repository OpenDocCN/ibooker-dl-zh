   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">10.1</span> AI: A transformation </h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p8"> 
   <p>AI is a transformative field in computer science. It aims to create machines and solutions that can mimic human intelligence. AI has indeed come a long way since its birth and is changing our lives in multiple ways. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p9"> 
   <p>The concept of AI can be traced back to the mid-20th century. In 1956, John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon organized the Darmouth Workshop, which is often credited for the birth of AI, as during this workshop the term “artificial intelligence” was coined. The researchers wanted to see how machines can mimic human intelligence and be used for everyday life. In the initial years, the researchers focused on symbolic AI. This approach involved using symbols and logic to represent the knowledge and solve the problems. The progress in AI slowed down during 1970s and 1980s when the funding was reduced. The late 20th century and the early 21st century saw the resurgence of AI, thanks to the development of machine learning techniques like neural networks and deep learning. The new enabled AI systems started to make predictions and decisions by learning from the historical data. With the availability of cloud computing, better service, and more processing power, the training of algorithms was faster, easier, and cheaper, and there was a shift from rule-driven to data-driven algorithms. With the launch of libraries like TensorFlow and Keras, creating deep learning networks became something that anyone with an internet connection could do.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p10"> 
   <p>AI has had a significant effect on day-to-day life. For example, we have virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to make recommendations on streaming platforms and e-commerce websites. AI has been applied in finance, retail, aviation, life sciences, manufacturing, and many other industries and business functions, improving efficiency and decision-making processes, increasing customer satisfaction, and decreasing costs. The integration of AI with robotics has resulted in auto-driving cars, drones, automation, and digital twins. We now have very intelligent robotic systems that have the capability to perform very complex tasks. AI has thus far been a boon to the human race, and with responsible use, it can provide great benefits.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p11"> 
   <p>AI continues to grow, and that growth presents a unique set of opportunities and challenges. There are biases and ethical concerns in AI systems; many activists have also raised concerns about potential job displacements due to automation. Policymakers and the government along with researchers are working tirelessly to make sure that AI technologies are used responsibly and developed to serve humans, not work against them.</p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p12"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">10.2</span> GenAI and its significance</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p13"> 
   <p>GenAI is a transformative field within the broader domains of AI. It is a testament to one of the remarkable achievements we have made in the field of machine learning, resulting in improvements in computer processing and generation of new content. You have no doubt seen the examples of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) and its advanced versions, which are being used in multiple industries and functions. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p14"> 
   <p>The significant difference between traditional AI and GenAI is that GenAI solutions can produce data while traditional AI systems perform tasks like predictions, recommendations, or classifications. GenAI solutions are generally based on GANs—autoregressive models like the transformer architecture, which empowers solutions like GPT.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p15"> 
   <p>GenAI is useful for multiple business domains and functions. A few of them are as follows:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p16"> Natural language processing-based solutions have immensely benefitted from GenAI models. GenAI has enabled the development of intelligent chatbots, virtual assistants, summarization of text, query engines, and customized content. These solutions have been helpful for branding and marketing purposes, customer services, research and development, optimizations, and academics. The use of GenAI for natural language processing (NLP) is huge and is expanding and improving every day. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p17"> The life sciences and healthcare industry has been revolutionized through GenAI tools. With these tools, the discovery of new drugs, generation of medical reports, simulation of medical scenarios, training of healthcare professionals, search of medical journals, and the overall medical research profession has improved significantly. For example, AI can identify existing drugs that could be repurposed for new therapeutic uses. By analyzing large datasets, AI can discover connections between drugs and diseases that were not previously recognized. AI-driven virtual screening can predict the binding affinity of small molecules to target proteins. This saves time and resources by reducing the number of compounds that need to be synthesized and tested in the lab. The use of GenAI within the healthcare industry is immensely beneficial for humans. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p18"> Machine learning and data analysis is completely dependent on the quantity and quality of data available. Many times, there is a scarcity of good-quality datasets. GenAI is playing a valuable role in the creation of synthetic data to augment and expand smaller datasets. This process improves the overall quality of the training dataset and hence improves the performance of the model. Using the synthetic data, the model becomes less generic, and the risk of overfitting is reduced. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p19"> Using GenAI, customer experiences are improving. With GenAI algorithms, a business is able to create customized recommendations, experiences, content, and solutions. With this enhanced experience, overall user engagement is improved, and the customer becomes more satisfied, leading to higher customer lifetime value. Certainly, GenAI has been changing the personalization experience of customers. It can be extended to any business domain like retail, finance, telecom, or aviation. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p20"> GenAI’s ability to create content like art, music, text, videos, and images is very useful. It helps professionals in the creative fields by automating multiple steps of their work. Authors now can use GenAI for innovative ideas, image designers can use it to create designs, and music directors can use it to create a piece of music. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p21"> In the field of research and science, GenAI is helping scientists and researchers in the simulation of experiments. It can simulate multiple scenarios, model very complex physical systems, and predict the outcome of the experiments. Certainly, it decreases the amount of time and cost involved in the overall experiment. Researchers and scientists can reach results much faster now. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p22"> 
   <p>These are only a few examples of the significance of GenAI; the possibilities are immense. GenAI is certainly a game-changer with futuristic applications. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p23"> 
   <p>Next we compare discriminative and generative models. We have discussed discriminative models throughout the book. Now we will clarify the differences between discriminative models and GenAI ones.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p24"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">10.3</span> Discriminative models and GenAI</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p25"> 
   <p>In the realm of machine learning and AI, discriminative models and generative models are two fundamental approaches. Both can be used for classification, estimation, and generation purposes. There are similarities and differences.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p26"> 
   <p>Discriminative models create the boundary that separates different classes or categories of datasets. These types of models are generally helpful for making predictions and for data classification solutions. Some of the attributes of discriminative models are as follows:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p27"> Discriminative models are generally used in supervised learning solutions. As you know, supervised learning is for labeled datasets, where we have a target variable to train an algorithm. Using supervised learning solutions for categorical variables, we can predict the probability for an event to happen or not—for example, if the customer will churn or not, whether the incoming credit card transaction is fraud or genuine, and so on. Similarly, using supervised learning solutions for numeric variables, we can predict an estimated value for a numeric variable—for example, what the sales of a store next month will be or the number of calls a call center can expect in the next week. Discriminative models predict the conditional probability for an output given an input value, and hence they are a great solution for any kind of classification task. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p28"> The most common examples of discriminative models are logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and deep learning–based networks used for image and text classification. There are many discriminative models at our disposable. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p29"> 
   <p>For generative models, our purpose is to capture the underlying distribution of the data they are trained on. They seek to learn how the data is generated and how they can use that intelligence to generate new data points that are similar to the training dataset. Some of the salient attributes of the generative models are as follows:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p30"> Generative models provide a probability distribution over the entire data space; they can generate new data points that are similar to the training data. It makes them very helpful for solutions like synthetic text and image generation. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p31"> Generative models are very helpful for unsupervised learning solutions like dimensionality reduction and clustering. This is because they do not rely on the presence of explicit labels, and hence they can reveal the underlying patterns present in the dataset. A few examples are hidden Markov models, GANs, and variational autoencoders. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p32"> 
   <p>If we compare discriminative and generative models, we will find the following:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p33"> Generative models generally require a bigger dataset for training as they have to learn the entire data distribution. Discriminative models, however, can work with smaller labeled datasets too. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p34"> Generative models are typically much more complex than discriminative models. Generative models use the underlying structure of the data and require more computational time and resources to achieve the solution. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p35"> Generative models have been used for content generation and the estimation of density; discriminative models, on the other hand, are designed for broader classifications and predictions. Hence, in current scenarios you will find discriminative models are more popular than generative models. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p36"> Discriminative models are more efficient and require less computation cost and memory. Thus they are more popular in the present scenarios for industry. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p37"> 
   <p>Both generative and discriminative models have their own set of pros and cons. The choice depends on the business problem at hand and the dataset available. While discriminative models are much more effective and efficient in classification and prediction, generative models are more versatile and useful for data generation and exploration. As users, we require an in-depth understanding of these models and their characteristics. Only then can we choose the right solution for the business problem at hand. </p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p38"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">10.4</span> Generative adversarial networks</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p39"> 
   <p>GANs represent a revolutionary deep learning architecture that has made significant contributions to the field of generative modeling. GANs were introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014 and have since become a cornerstone in various applications, including image generation, style transfer, data augmentation, and more. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p40"> 
   <p>At their core, GANs consist of two neural networks: the generator and the discriminator. The generator is responsible for creating synthetic data, such as images or text, while the discriminator’s role is to distinguish between real data and data produced by the generator. In our in-depth explanation, we dissect the GAN architecture, providing a detailed understanding of its key components, training process, and practical applications.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p41"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">10.4.1</span> The generator network</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p42"> 
   <p>The generator network is the creative force behind GANs. Its primary role is to produce synthetic data, mimicking real data as closely as possible. The generator network takes random noise as input, often sampled from a simple distribution like a Gaussian or uniform distribution. This noise vector is then passed through a series of layers, typically consisting of convolutional or transposed convolutional layers in the case of image generation or recurrent layers for text generation. The generator’s purpose is to transform the input noise into data that closely resembles the real data distribution. See figure 10.1.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p43"> 
   <p>Let’s take a closer look at how the generator network operates:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p44"> <em>Input noise</em><em> </em>—The generator initiates the process with an input noise vector. This noise vector serves as the seed for generating data. The noise vector is typically drawn from a simple probability distribution, such as a Gaussian distribution. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p45"> <em>Transformations</em><em> </em>—The input noise is passed through a series of layers within the generator. Each layer transforms the input in a way that makes it increasingly resemble the real data distribution. These transformations are learned through the training process. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p46"> <em>Generation</em><em> </em>—As the input noise progresses through the network, it gradually takes on the characteristics of the target data. This transformation process continues until the data produced by the generator is presented as the final output. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p47"> <em>Loss function</em><em> </em>—The quality of the generated data is measured using a loss function, which quantifies how similar the generated data is to the real data. The goal of the generator is to minimize this loss, thereby creating data that is as realistic as possible.<span class="aframe-location"/> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p48">

   <h5 class=" figure-container-h5"><span class="num-string">Figure 10.1</span> Representation of a GAN </h5>
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p49"> 
   <p>The generator’s ultimate objective is to produce data that is virtually indistinguishable from authentic data. However, achieving this level of realism is a complex task, and it relies heavily on the adversarial relationship with the discriminator network.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p50"> 
   <p>We now move to the counterpart of the generative network, which is the discriminator network.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p51"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">10.4.2</span> The discriminator network</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p52"> 
   <p>The discriminator network, as the counterpart of the generator, plays a crucial role in GANs. Its purpose is to differentiate between real data and fake data. The discriminator is a binary classifier, trained to assign high probabilities (close to 1) to real data and low probabilities (close to 0) to fake data.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p53"> 
   <p>Let’s explore the discriminator network in more detail:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p54"> <em>Training data</em><em> </em>—Usually, the discriminator network is exposed to a dataset comprising real data. This dataset is primarily used to clean the discriminator, which allows it to distinguish the authentic data from the synthetic data. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p55"> <em>Discrimination</em><em> </em>—When the discriminator has been trained, we can use it to evaluate the datasets. It takes both real data from the training dataset used and the synthetic data produced by the generator as an input. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p56"> <em>Loss calculation</em><em> </em>—Now the discriminator computes a loss. This loss or error is based on the ability of the discriminator to distinguish real data from the synthetic data. If the discriminator correctly identifies real data as real and synthetic data as synthetic, it means the performance is good, and hence the loss is minimized. However, if the discriminator makes some errors, the loss would increase. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p57"> <em>Parameters updates</em><em> </em>—The discriminator’s parameters are adjusted to minimize the computed loss. These updates are helpful for the discriminator to increase its accuracy. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p58"> 
   <p>With an understanding of the underlying structure behind GANs, we now move to the heart of the entire process: the training of the network.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p59"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">10.4.3</span> Adversarial training</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p60"> 
   <p>The adversarial training process is the heart of the GAN architectures. The overall training process is as follows:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ol> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p61"> Initially, both the generator and the discriminator start with random weights. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p62"> The generator produces synthetic data from the random noise and presents it to the discriminator along with the real dataset. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p63"> The discriminator analyzes, assesses, and assigns probabilities to each input. This is an attempt to correctly distinguish real data from the synthetic data. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p64"> The generator is updated based on the feedback from the discriminator. The objective is to generate data that becomes indistinguishable from the real data by the discriminator. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p65"> The discriminator is updated to improve its ability to differentiate between real and synthetic data. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p66"> This process is continued iteratively. The generator and the discriminator keep on improving their capabilities. The generator becomes increasingly adept at producing a realistic dataset while the discriminator becomes more skilled at the identification process. This iterative and interesting competition drives the overall solution to a point where the generated data is virtually indistinguishable from the authentic dataset. </li> 
  </ol> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p67"> 
   <p>The overall training process relies on two key loss functions:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p68"> <em>Generator loss</em><em> </em>—This function aims to minimize the discriminator’s ability to distinguish between real and synthetic datasets. Commonly used loss function examples are binary cross entropy loss, which allows the generator to produce data that the discriminator is more likely to classify as real. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p69"> <em>Discriminator loss</em><em> </em>—The discriminator loss function’s purpose is to maximize its ability to distinguish real datasets from the synthetic or fake datasets. It aims to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss while assessing real data and maximizes when working on generated or synthetic datasets. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p70"> 
   <p>GANs are quite remarkable with this training process. We now move to a few variants of GAN and some applications.</p> 
  </div>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p72"> 
   <p>GANS are useful for specific challenges and problems. This has also led to some of the prominent variants that follow:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p73"> <em>Conditional GAN</em><em> </em>—These models take additional information (e.g., class labels) as input to control the generated data’s attributes. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p74"> <em>Deep convolutional GANs</em><em> </em>—Optimized for image generation, deep convolutional GANs use convolutional layers to generate high-quality images. </li>

   <p>Next, we briefly cover the latest technological solutions available—for example, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), GPT-3, and others. </p> 
  </div>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p103"> 
   <p>Integrating GenAI into real-world business involves a systematic process that requires careful planning and consideration. Consider the following step-by-step guide on how to integrate GenAI effectively:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ol> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p104"> <em>Set the objectives and business problem definition.</em> First, we should define the specific objectives and use cases for GenAI within our business priorities. This requires determining where it can provide the most value—whether that’s customer support and solutions, data analysis/visualizations, personalization, content generation, or others. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p105"> <em>Evaluate the data available and the infrastructure.</em> Next, we should check the data available and assess its quality and quantity. High-quality data is essential for training and maintaining GenAI models. We also must ensure that our IT infrastructure can support the integration of AI systems. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p106"> <em>Select the model.</em> We then choose to develop a custom GenAI model or to use an existing pretrained model. If we decide to build a custom model, we will have to consider working with AI development teams or external vendors with expertise in the field. This is a vital step, as we should choose teams that have the required skills to develop the models. It is better to take recommendations from the experts in the field. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p107"> <em>Perform data collation, preprocessing, and preparation.</em> Data is the protagonist here, and the next step is to gather and preprocess the data necessary to train the GenAI model. This may involve cleaning, labeling, and structuring the data for training. Data preprocessing is a critical step for model accuracy. The data should be representative of the business problem at hand. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p108"> <em>Train the model.</em> We next train the GenAI model using the preprocessed data. This process may require powerful hardware and deep learning expertise. There might be some iterations to the model to align with our specific business requirements. This step can take a lot of time, depending on the quantity of the data, the quality of the infrastructure, and the complexity of the solution. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p109"> <em>Test, validate, and tweak.</em> We then test the GenAI system to ensure that it functions as expected. This will involve validating its performance on real-world data and use cases. A few variables to keep in mind are accuracy, response times, and user experience. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p110"> <em>Perform user education and training.</em> GenAI will be used by employees, customers, or other stakeholders; hence, we have to provide training and educational materials on how to use the AI system effectively. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p111"> <em>Consider compliance and privacy.</em> It is vital to develop guidelines and policies for the responsible use of GenAI, addressing problems like privacy, bias, and compliance with relevant regulations. We have to ensure that the AI system aligns with our organization’s ethical standards. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p112"> <em>Perform maintenance.</em> As our business grows, the demand on GenAI may increase. We have to regularly update the model with fresh data to keep it accurate and effective. We should always plan for scalability and ongoing maintenance. It is important to implement monitoring systems to track GenAI’s performance and user feedback. This information can help us in making continuous improvements and address any problems that arise. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p113"> <em>Adapt, innovate, and improve.</em> We should continuously evaluate the return on investment of this GenAI integration by determining whether the expected benefits are being realized and adjust as needed. It is important that we stay abreast of advancements in AI technology and continually adapt and innovate our GenAI integration to remain competitive and efficient. </li>
