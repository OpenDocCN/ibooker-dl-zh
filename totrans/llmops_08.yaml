    about technology, and many people assume they’re the same thing. In fact, they’re
    very different concepts. *Privacy* is about control over your personal information—who
    gets to know what about you. *Security*, on the other hand, is about protecting
    that information from being stolen, leaked, or accessed without permission. They
    overlap, for sure, but understanding the difference becomes really critical when
    we talk about LLMs, because these models expose both privacy and security risks
    in ways no one has ever dealt with before.

    integrated so seamlessly into so many products and services, it’s hard to keep
    tabs on what is still private and what isn’t. One major concern is that chat interfaces
    like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude are being adopted as easy-to-use search services,
    and their interactions can seem humanlike, potentially leading users to reveal
    more than they should. Robust cybersecurity has become a must-have for all AI
    and ML companies.

    ChatGPT in its research for an aviation injury claim. The media spent days discussing
    the unreliability of LLMs and lack of trust in the information they provide. Another
    serious issue is the need to educate users, especially children and the elderly,
    about these chat personas and the risks associated with them. In late 2024, the

    the different kinds of risks to which LLMs are exposed and how enterprises at

    simpler NLP models like BERT, the focus is often on a single domain and a single
    problem. You provide structured data inputs—clean rows of labeled data, maybe
    a few predefined variables, or a small set of known features—and get an output.
    As such, the data that feeds these models is usually controlled, curated, and
    mostly constrained. There are only so many ways to interpret a dataset of structured
    inputs.

    data. And when we say *vast*, we mean entire chunks of the internet, which can
    include sensitive personally identifiable information (PII), medical records,
    private messages, and things no one even realized were public. This is where privacy
    becomes a huge concern. The scope of the data ingested by these models is far
    wider and, more importantly, often less predictable than prior contexts; given
    the sheer amount of this data, nobody can review it in its entirety to confirm
    that nothing private has been ingested. And what’s worse, in the race to make
    bigger and more performant models, there’s little incentive to prioritize reviewing
    data over releasing something better earlier.

    LLMs can inadvertently retain, surface, or even leak pieces of private information
    that are buried in their training data. And because LLMs don’t “forget” in the
    same way that humans do, this information stays as a node in the neural networks,
    waiting for the right prompt to bring it back into public view. LLMs train on
    the statistical patterns in their data, but in doing so, they can retain traces
    of sensitive information. Unlike simpler models that focus on specific tasks,
    LLMs don’t have predefined guardrails that say, “This is a boundary we won’t cross.”

    what you watched, when you watched it, what genres you like, and so on; it doesn’t
    necessarily “know” anything about your political opinions, your job, or your personal
    conversations. But with the integration of LLMs into recommender systems, which
    is currently an area of active research at Netflix, the company can very quickly
    learn about your biases, preferences, and so on. It would be harmful enough if
    Netflix’s recommendation model were to leak information about, say, your favorite
    show to the public. But if an LLM chatbot inadvertently were to recall your private
    medical history or your Social Security number, it would be a problem on an entirely
    different level.

    what specific pieces of data leads to any particular output. It’s not like you
    can go into the neural network and isolate the bit that made the model say, “Hey,
    that sounds like an email you wrote in 2017.” Interpretability and explainability
    remain open challenges with models with such a large number of parameters. Additionally,
    their open-ended search capabilities make LLMs better, but also far more intrusive.
    They don’t just predict—they infer. They extrapolate. This is especially concerning
    when models are applied in sensitive domains like healthcare or law, where personal
    details could inadvertently resurface. That’s why regulating LLMs is both so critical
    and so complex.

    with straightforward evaluation, using precision, recall, and F1 score, as discussed
    in [Chapter 7](ch07.html#ch07_evaluation_for_llms_1748896751667823). The data
    they use is generally structured, labeled, and subject to laws like the General
    Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
    There are guidelines on how their data should be anonymized, stored, and processed.
    And when a breach happens, it’s relatively easy to audit and fix.

    a representation of each piece of data in a few of its billion parameters—not
    as a record but as a sequence of mathematical computations that can only be triggered
    by a specific input. More alarmingly, because of the nature of the training process,
    it’s difficult to get an LLM to “unlearn” data once it’s been absorbed. Even if
    you follow the letter of the law, enforcing compliance is tricky; how do you ensure
    that a model trained on terabytes of data doesn’t retain PII it was never supposed
    to have? And how do you address privacy concerns when you’re constantly retraining

    real-world attackers to test how well each part of the system defends itself,

    as *white-hat hacking*. Usually this includes indirect prompt injection, data
    poisoning, and social engineering attacks, multistep attacks (say, from model
    jailbreaking to privilege escalation to data exfiltration), attempting model exfiltration
    or theft (especially in the multitenant and federated SMPC environments common

    unauthorized model copies or leaks and to flag content from the model in downstream
    systems. As of now, model watermarking is still at an experimental stage.

    instead inform an ongoing monitoring plan. LLMs evolve rapidly and inputs shift,
    so new use cases emerge constantly. But without a structured review system, today’s
    complaint system can easily become tomorrow’s liability. Thus, a robust LLM audit
    isn’t complete without defining a plan for ongoing monitoring, incident response,
    and performance reassessment.

    audits are a must. Conducting these audits, even internal audits, regularly—say,
    every quarter or so—helps the organization keep up with the latest threats and
    changes in the system. By the end of each audit, you’ll have a clearer picture
    of any risks, a list of vulnerabilities, and an actionable plan for improvement.

    time (as discussed in [“Step 9: Plan Ongoing Monitoring and Review”](#ch08_step_9_plan_ongoing_monitoring_and_review_1748896766178884))
    as compared to KPIs. This involves regularly testing the model against metrics
    like accuracy, relevance, and speed. Benchmarking against previous versions or
    similar models can reveal areas where the LLM might be slipping.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: User feedback and log data are also great resources for pinpointing specific
    issues, whether it’s slow response times or outputs that don’t quite hit the mark.
    If performance drops, it could be due to factors like model drift or outdated
    training data. Digging into these issues and addressing them—whether by optimization
    or updating the architecture—ensures that the LLM remains effective and continues
    to meet user expectations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, incorporate human-in-the-loop reviews to add an extra layer of
    oversight to the LLM’s operations. HITL is particularly useful in high-stakes
    applications, where a machine-only system might miss subtle but critical details.
    At HITL checkpoints, human reviewers can step in to evaluate certain outputs,
    flagging any that seem biased, inaccurate, or contextually off. Setting up a feedback
    loop, like HITL, means that any flagged responses can help improve the model,
    especially when it comes to retraining or fine-tuning. This human oversight creates
    a valuable safety net, catching issues that automated systems might overlook and
    keeping the LLM reliable and trustworthy.

- en: Once auditing, monitoring, and remediation plans are in motion, technical teams,
    especially LLMOps engineers, need actionable tools to operationalize safety and
    integrity in real time. This is where guardrails come in. *Guardrails* are policies,
    checks, and automated tools that help LLM applications stay aligned with their
    intended behavior, whether that’s avoiding harmful outputs, upholding compliance
    rules, or flagging ethical concerns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Technical guardrails* include real-time filters, rate limiters, prompt validation
    systems, and output classifiers. They should ensure that LLM inference times meet
    performance targets, especially in real-time applications. This could involve
    using techniques like model quantization or distillation to reduce the computational
    load or implementing automated testing pipelines that continuously evaluate model
    outputs in real time.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tools like [GuardRails.ai](http://guardrails.ai) and [Arthur](http://arthur.ai)
    are helping automate and scale much of these practices. While GuardRails.ai provides
    a framework for defining expected model behavior, input validation, and hallucinations,
    Arthur focuses more on model performance, data poisoning, and bias and drift detection
    after deployment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Operational guardrails* include HITL review cycles, escalation workflows,
    and model version controls. Operational guardrails need to continuously monitor
    the performance, looking for anomalies such as sudden shifts in output quality
    or response times. Alert systems should be in place to notify stakeholders of
    any issues.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ideally, operational guardrails ensure that models are deployed on scalable
    infrastructure (such as Kubernetes) to handle fluctuating workloads and prevent
    any overuse of resources that could lead to performance degradation or outages.
    Also, as time progresses, performance may degrade due to evolving language patterns
    or new data. Thus, your guardrails should include systems for detecting model
    drift and triggering retraining or fine-tuning. Also, establish systems that allow
    end users to flag incorrect or problematic outputs, allowing for iterative improvements.
    Incorporating real-world feedback into model-retraining processes is the key to
    build ing human feedback loops for improving and maintaining the robustness of
    these models in production.

    a systematic framework to understand the different kinds of threats your system
    is exposed to and plan your efforts to cover the entire surface area of your applications.
    This chapter has walked you through the steps of an LLMSecOps audit and discussed
    some tools that will help you proactively secure, monitor, and improve LLM applications
    across their lifecycle. With the fast pace of progress in this field, LLMSecOps
    is an important discipline that is still developing. It requires technical rigor
    as well as ethical foresight, and mastery of it will be the biggest differentiating
    factor between companies that do LLMOps well and those that don’t.
