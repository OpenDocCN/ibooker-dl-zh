- en: In the previous chapters, you saw how Tableau Pulse works for metric authors
    and metric end users; now it’s time to learn about how to integrate Tableau Pulse
    with Slack, Salesforce customer relationship management (CRM), and custom web
    applications or web pages. In this chapter, you’ll also learn about developer
    tools, like the Tableau REST API, allowing you to programmatically create and
    administer metric definitions, metrics, insights, and digest subscriptions.

    the advanced features available when using Tableau Pulse. It is advisable that
    you partner with a developer who specializes in Salesforce, web development, and/or

    Tableau recommends matching the link location of the library to the Tableau version

    Cloud, a best practice would be to link to the library available for Tableau Cloud.
    Tableau has several instances of Tableau Cloud running, which are location (geography)
    dependent. These instances, called *pods*, can be determined by looking at the
    subdomain of your Tableau Cloud’s URL. [Example 6-1](#ch06_example_1_1732595609341709)
