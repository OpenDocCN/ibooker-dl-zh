- en: At this point, you should have developed a strategy for your AI initiatives
    that can be communicated effectively. Now your organization needs to execute it.
    Getting people to take action can be challenging, especially in mature companies.
    These companies are optimized for their markets and struggle with adopting disruptive
    innovations like AI. Fortunately, Geoffrey Moore’s Zone to Win framework, described
    in his book by the same name (Diversion Books), offers guidance. Over the past
    decade, I have adapted this framework for AI initiatives. It’s allowed my leadership
    team to execute with consistency. In this section, I provide you with a step-by-step
    guide (with examples) for applying this framework.
