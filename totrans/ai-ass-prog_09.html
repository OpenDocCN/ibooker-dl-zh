<h1><span class="label">Chapter 8. </span>Coding</h1>&#13;
<p>In this chapter, we’ll dive into some handy coding techniques<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="coding techniques with AI" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_codingtechniqueswithAI.08.3.65"/>. We’ll start with the bread and butter of coding—playing around with functions and classes. Then, we’ll get our hands dirty with a bit of refactoring, tidying up messy code and making it run smoother. We’ll also show how to work with and create data. Then we’ll check out some AI tools that can help create fancy frontends without breaking a sweat.</p>&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Reality Check" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="reality_check">&#13;
<h1>Reality Check</h1>&#13;
<p>AI-assisted programming<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-assisted programming" data-secondary="reality check on coding effectiveness" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_AIassistedprogrammingrealitycheckoncodingeffectiveness.08.6.27"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="coding techniques with AI" data-secondary="reality check on AI code writing quality" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_codingtechniqueswithAIrealitycheckonAIcodewritingquality.08.6.27"/> tools are pretty cool, right? But let’s not kid ourselves. They’re not the magic wand that can solve all our coding problems. Why? Well, these tools are like those students in class who only learn from public notes. They’re trained on a mishmash of code from all over the internet, and let’s be honest, not all of it is top-notch. What does this mean for you? Sometimes, you might get code that’s more bloated than a Thanksgiving turkey or as maintainable as a house of cards. And sometimes the code is just plain wrong, doesn’t do what you need, or, even worse, leaves your front door wide open for hackers or the hogging of your network resources.</p>&#13;
<p>Let’s look at an example where ChatGPT<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ChatGPT" data-secondary="messy code example" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_ChatGPTmessycodeexample.08.7.42"/> produced messy code. <a data-type="xref" href="#when_asked_to_merge_two_sorted_listscomm">Figure 8-1</a> shows code for merging two sorted lists into a single sorted list.</p>&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="when_asked_to_merge_two_sorted_listscomm">&#13;
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0801.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 8-1. </span>When asked to merge two sorted lists, ChatGPT created some messy code</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>This AI-generated code does correctly merge two lists, but it takes a verbose approach. It separately handles the cases of empty lists and uses two additional <code>while</code> loops to append the remaining elements from each list.</p>&#13;
<p>This is where your coding smarts really come into play. You’ve got to know the fundamentals. You need to know what questions to ask and where to poke around when something isn’t quite right.</p>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#with_some_human_helpcomma_weapostropheve">Figure 8-2</a> shows a better approach.</p>&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 8-2. </span>With some human help, we’ve achieved a better approach to the merging of the sorted lists</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>So don’t worry about all the doom and gloom you may hear about robots taking over developer jobs. Granted, these AI models are getting better all the time. They’re learning and growing. Yet they are still far from being the be-all and end-all of programming. Programmers are still very much in the game. AI-assisted programming tools are extremely helpful, but they’re not about to replace the savvy and know-how of real, live engineers.</p>&#13;
<p>When you’re jamming with these systems, remember: it’s a collaboration, not a handover. Stay sharp, stay curious, and don’t forget to double-check everything these AI tools serve up. They’re helpers, not heroes<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_AIassistedprogrammingrealitycheckoncodingeffectiveness.08.6.27" data-type="indexterm" id="id767"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_codingtechniqueswithAIrealitycheckonAIcodewritingquality.08.6.27" data-type="indexterm" id="id768"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_ChatGPTmessycodeexample.08.7.42" data-type="indexterm" id="id769"/>.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Judgment Calls" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="judgment_calls">&#13;
<h1>Judgment Calls</h1>&#13;
<p>Sometimes, it’s simpler to just do the coding<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="coding techniques with AI" data-secondary="judgment calls and human versus AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id770"/> yourself instead of using an AI-assisted programming tool. After all, it can take a bunch of tries to get the AI to catch on to what you need. But as you keep using these AI tools, you’ll get the hang of figuring out when they’re useful or when you’re better off flying solo.</p>&#13;
<p>Take the experience of Dmitrii Ivashchenko<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Ivashchenko, Dmitrii" data-type="indexterm" id="id771"/>, a lead software engineer at MY.GAMES, an Amsterdam-based game company with over 1 billion registered users worldwide. According to him:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>An example would be the prompt “Write a method in Python to add a default timezone to the datetime object.” However, you should be prepared that many aspects will be omitted and you will either have to finalize the handling of corner cases yourself or have a long correspondence with ChatGPT pointing out its errors. The main thing here is to initially gauge the time it takes to explain a task versus what it will take for you to implement it yourself.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
<section class="pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="Learning" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="learning">&#13;
<h1 class="less_space">Learning</h1>&#13;
<p>Using something like ChatGPT<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="coding techniques with AI" data-secondary="learning scenarios" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_codingtechniqueswithAIlearningscenarios.08.32.32"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="learning code, AI as instructor for" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_learningcodeAIasinstructorfor.08.32.32"/> to pick up a new language, framework, or library can be a big help. It may be faster than the old-school ways like taking a course, endlessly Googling, or watching a bunch of YouTube videos.</p>&#13;
<p>You can use ChatGPT to get the lowdown on all the basics and syntax of the code. Plus, if you’re more of a learn-by-doing type, you can ask for code examples to see how everything clicks together. If you already know one programming language, ChatGPT can make learning a new one easier by comparing the two. Suppose you’re good with Python but just diving into JavaScript; it can explain the main differences in Python terms. If you need more resources, ChatGPT can scour the internet and recommend some solid learning materials for you.</p>&#13;
<p>Here are some prompts to consider:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> For someone who does not know Python, what should I learn first?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What are some beginner-friendly projects I can try to improve my skills in React?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Can you suggest resources for learning advanced SQL queries?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How would you implement a basic “to-do list” app in both Python and JavaScript to highlight their differences?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I know how to use loops in C++. Can you show me how loops work in Python for comparison?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Find 5 useful YouTube videos that show how to learn Rust.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Let’s now see how Ivashchenko approaches this:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>If you want to quickly master a new language or framework, you can immediately start making a new project on that technology. Let’s say you want to learn Django. Let’s choose a project that we will implement on this technology—let it be an online store. To begin with, just ask ChatGPT how to start developing a new project on Django. It will tell you what dependencies you need to install, how to set up the initial configuration of the project, and what related technologies you will need to deal with. Then we move on to more specific requests such as “How is a model organized in Django?” “How to add a new section in the admin panel?” and “How to migrate the database?” By gradually gaining new knowledge and asking more and more detailed questions, you can realize almost any project on any previously unfamiliar technology. This is how I mastered Django literally through a weekend of fruitful work.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>You can have ChatGPT create useful study guides as well. Here’s a sample prompt:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Create a study guide for JavaScript. Focus on a beginner level.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">You can then follow this up with:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Please create a study schedule for me. What topics should I study? What about practice exercises or quizzes? Coding problems? Links to resources?</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>ChatGPT can even help you to remember new concepts. One way is to use a mnemonic device, such as acronyms. For example, suppose you want to remember the key elements of DevOps, which include continuous integration, continuous delivery, microservices, and infrastructure as code. This is what ChatGPT suggests:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>ChatGPT:</em> CI-CD-MI (pronounced “Ci-Ci-D-Mi”)</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Finally, you can use ChatGPT to get help with LeetCode<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LeetCode" data-type="indexterm" id="id772"/>. Picture it: you’re sitting in the interview room, maybe with a whiteboard or a laptop in front of you, and then they hit you with this brain-teasing algorithm or data structure question. It’s more than just coding. They’re sizing up how quickly you think, how well you explain your thoughts, and your problem-solving style.</p>&#13;
<p>If you want to get a leg up, think about signing up for LeetCode. It’s $35 a month. But of course, ChatGPT can lend a hand whenever you need it. Here’s a simple prompt:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Suggest 3 common LeetCode interview questions.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>ChatGPT then came up with challenges like two sum, longest substring without repeating characters, and valid parentheses. You can then dive deeper, such as by getting longer explanations or examples<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_codingtechniqueswithAIlearningscenarios.08.32.32" data-type="indexterm" id="id773"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_learningcodeAIasinstructorfor.08.32.32" data-type="indexterm" id="id774"/>.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Comments" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="comments-id00009">&#13;
<h1>Comments</h1>&#13;
<p>When you’re racing against a deadline, it’s easy to skimp on code comments<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="coding techniques with AI" data-secondary="comments" data-type="indexterm" id="id775"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="comments" data-secondary="coding techniques with AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id776"/> or ditch them altogether. But AI-assisted tools can have your back. You’ll often find code suggestions with comments already included.</p>&#13;
<p>Funny enough, because of AI technologies, having comments may feel somewhat retro. If code’s got you scratching your head, you could just ask the tool to break it down for you, right? This is certainly true.</p>&#13;
<p>Something else: writing prompts is becoming the new way to comment. After all, most tools include the prompts in the comment lines.</p>&#13;
<p>Of course, if you want to add comments to some code, you can use a simple prompt like:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Add comments that are clear and according to best coding practices.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">Whether or not to comment is your call. There’s no one-size-fits-all rule here. It’s all about what works for you and your team. But one thing’s for sure—slapping comments onto your code is a breeze with AI-assisted tools.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Modular Programming" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="modular_programming">&#13;
<h1>Modular Programming</h1>&#13;
<p>Modular programming<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="coding techniques with AI" data-secondary="modular programming" data-type="indexterm" id="id777"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="modular programming" data-type="indexterm" id="id778"/> is a cornerstone of efficient and effective software development. With modular programming, coding is more organized, easier to understand, and easier to keep up with. It also makes teaming up with other coders a lot less of a headache because everyone’s not tripping over each other. Plus, modules are reusable; reusability is a massive time-saver, keeps things consistent, and makes it less likely you’ll goof up.</p>&#13;
<p>The value of modular programming certainly applies to how you work with AI-assisted tools. They will not whip up an advanced application from a simple prompt. They’re not wizards. But if you break your task down into clear, specific pieces, these tools shine. Otherwise, you might end up with a code jumble that’s way off track.</p>&#13;
<p>According to Titus Capilnean<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Capilnean, Titus" data-type="indexterm" id="id779"/>, the cofounder and chief product officer at Private Market Labs:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>After I started using AI tools, I could focus on the problem and my approach to get a solution, not the minutiae of the actual code I need to write. When I have a technical problem, I start by breaking it down into smaller pieces, where the inputs and outputs are clear. The reason for this is that the context window of the AI tool I’m using might not be sufficient to come up with a good solution in one shot. I found that it’s easier to debug and build if I ask the model to deliver code that uses a simple input, does one single job and provides an output I can verify. If I’m not happy with the intermediate output, I describe my issue to ChatGPT and attempt to run the updated code it delivers. Once I’m happy with the solution, I can add extra processing steps, either inside the existing function or that takes the output of the previous step and refines it further, closer to my desired solution.</p>&#13;
<p>AI tools also improved my productivity by allowing me to check whether a snippet of code I built is actually correct before even sending it to a compiler or deploying a cloud function and consuming resources on an error. I just paste the part of the code in the ChatGPT window and ask whether it is correct, assuming I initialized/provided the correct context for the snippet to function (e.g., imports, variables, constants, custom functions being called, etc.). This allows me to produce solutions that run well and faster.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
<section class="pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="Starting a Project" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="starting_a_project">&#13;
<h1 class="less_space">Starting a Project</h1>&#13;
<p>At the start<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="coding techniques with AI" data-secondary="starting a project" data-type="indexterm" id="id780"/> of a coding project, you may hit the “cold start problem” or “blank page problem.”</p>&#13;
<p>Here’s a scenario: you’re staring at an empty screen, no code, no data, not even a clear path forward. No doubt, it’s as overwhelming as it sounds. The first big headache is selecting your project’s architecture, design patterns, and what technology to use. These decisions are huge because you’ll be living with them for the long haul, so you want to nail them from the get-go as much as possible.</p>&#13;
<p>And let’s not forget the people factor. Getting your team on the same page, figuring out how to communicate effectively, and setting up a workflow from scratch—these can be just as challenging as the technology. It’s not just about slapping down those first lines of code. It’s about laying a solid foundation for everything that comes next. Tackling this phase needs a mix of smart planning, technical know-how, and solid teamwork.</p>&#13;
<p>AI-assisted programming tools can be a big help. You can use them to set up the basic scaffolding of your app. You’ll figure out a customized starting point that aligns with your vision. The tools save you from the nitty-gritty of initial setup and let you jump straight into the more interesting parts of your project.</p>&#13;
<p>You can come up with a particular task and then prompt the LLM to generate boilerplate or starter code<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="starter code (ChatGPT)" data-type="indexterm" id="id781"/>.</p>&#13;
<p>This is a sample prompt:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Generate starter code for a web app that aggregates a user’s social media feeds from multiple platforms into a single dashboard interface. What do you suggest I use for the language and frameworks? What about the general file structure?</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>With this, ChatGPT starts off by suggesting React for creating a smooth, single-page application (SPA)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="single-page application (SPA)" data-type="indexterm" id="id782"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="SPA (single-page application)" data-type="indexterm" id="id783"/>. It also suggests using Redux to maintain strongly styled and reusable components. It then says to use Node.js to run the application and Express.js for the API endpoints. It goes on to recommend Passport.js for the logins and MongoDB and Mongoose for the database and model building. As for the file structure, <a data-type="xref" href="#chatgpt_suggests_a_file_structure_for_a">Figure 8-3</a> shows the layout.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Autofill" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="autofill">&#13;
<h1>Autofill</h1>&#13;
<p>You know when you’re deep in the coding zone<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="coding techniques with AI" data-secondary="autofill" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_codingtechniqueswithAIautofill.08.106.48"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="autofill, with AI" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_autofillwithAI.08.106.48"/>, setting up those constants for time units, and it’s just line after repetitive line? Here’s where GitHub Copilot<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub Copilot" data-secondary="autofill capability" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_GitHubCopilotautofillcapability.08.106.162"/> jumps in. You can have it provide autofill.</p>&#13;
<p>Let’s take an example. Suppose you are creating an app that you want to make responsive. This means you will need to have constants for the breakpoints for a CSS-in-JS styled-components library.</p>&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">You can first write this:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">breakpoints = {&#13;
    'xs': '320px',  # Extra small devices</pre>&#13;
<p>Then in the inline chat, you can use this prompt:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Create constants for other screen sizes.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#this_is_output_from_copilot_that_suggest">Figure 8-4</a> shows the result. It provides other screen sizes and variables that have a similar style.</p>&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="this_is_output_from_copilot_that_suggest">&#13;
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0804.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 8-4. </span>This is output from Copilot that suggests different constants for screen sizes</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>You can go further with this. Copilot can help with autofill by looking at open files in your project.</p>&#13;
<p>According to Capilnean<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Capilnean, Titus" data-type="indexterm" id="id784"/>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>I found that Copilot is especially useful if you have parts of the code that are similar when it comes to data structures. If you have defined an object in another file that’s part of the code repository you’re working with, then when you are trying to define a similar object, it can reliably pre-fill the code for you as you type. For example, an object for a common API call, like a Sendgrid email, works well here.</p>&#13;
<p>However, this autocomplete can hallucinate if you’re not careful. On imports, for example, it won’t always get the folder structure right, especially if you designed your own code shape, or if the framework you’re using is fairly new and not well documented yet. In that case, I have to go in and manually check where the component is coming from and whether the directory that Copilot suggested was correct<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_codingtechniqueswithAIautofill.08.106.48" data-type="indexterm" id="id785"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_autofillwithAI.08.106.48" data-type="indexterm" id="id786"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_GitHubCopilotautofillcapability.08.106.162" data-type="indexterm" id="id787"/>.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Refactoring" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="refactoring">&#13;
<h1>Refactoring</h1>&#13;
<p>Refactoring<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="coding techniques with AI" data-secondary="refactoring" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_codingtechniqueswithAIrefactoring.08.129.15"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="refactoring with AI" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_refactoringwithAI.08.129.15"/> is like spring cleaning for your code. It’s all about tidying up, reorganizing, and sometimes sprucing things up. It’s not about adding new features or fixing bugs.</p>&#13;
<p>Refactoring keeps the codebase healthy, less cluttered, and more intuitive. This means when you or someone else jumps back in later, it’s easier to understand what’s going on, which cuts down on headaches and, well, swearing at the screen. Plus, cleaner code is usually more efficient and less buggy, so it’s a win-win for everyone involved.</p>&#13;
<p>Refactoring is one of those areas where AI-assisted tools shine. With a prompt or two, you can slice through the complexity of your code, trim the fat, and reorganize your code into something that’s not just functional but elegant. With AI in your corner, refactoring becomes less of a chore and more of a secret weapon for staying ahead of the curve.</p>&#13;
<p>In the next few sections of this chapter, we’ll take a look at some examples of refactoring.</p>&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Ninja Code" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ninja_code">&#13;
<h2>Ninja Code</h2>&#13;
<p>Think of ninja code<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ninja code, and refactoring" data-type="indexterm" id="id788"/> as one of those over-the-top action movie stunts. It’s flashy and complex, and it leaves you thinking, “Whoa, how’d they do that?” But here’s the catch: it’s a beast to figure out once the awe wears off. Imagine code so sneaky and tangled that even the person who wrote it can’t make heads or tails of it after their “ninja” phase passes. Sure, pulling off that ninja move feels epic in the moment, but when you or someone else needs to jump back in and make changes, it’s less “hi-ya!” and more “uh-oh.” The truth is, while ninja code might show off some serious programming chops, it often goes against the grain of good coding practices, which are all about keeping things clean, simple, and understandable.</p>&#13;
<p>Regardless, ninja code is common. But refactoring with an AI-assisted tool can help sort things out. Here’s an example:</p>&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">console.log((function(n, a = 0, b = 1) { while (--n) [a, b] = [b, a + b]; &#13;
return a; })(10));</pre>&#13;
<p>Make any sense? Well, you’d probably need to take quite a bit of time to figure this out. Instead, make ChatGPT do the work:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Can you explain this code in a step-by-step process? Also, can you write this in a simpler way that is more maintainable?</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>ChatGPT determines that this is a function to calculate the <em>n</em>th Fibonacci number. It goes on to describe it in six steps and then provides a simplified version, as seen in <a data-type="xref" href="#chatgpt_has_provided_a_simpler_version_o">Figure 8-5</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>ChatGPT:</em> In this version, the calculateFibonacci function clearly shows the process of iterating through the Fibonacci sequence. It’s more verbose but much easier to understand and maintain, especially for other developers who might read this code in the future.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Extract Method" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="extract_method">&#13;
<h2>Extract Method</h2>&#13;
<p>You apply the extract method<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="extract method, and refactoring" data-type="indexterm" id="id789"/> when you have a long method or function. You’ll pick out a chunk of the code that’s focused on a certain task—say data checking or a specific calculation—and you’ll turn this into a new method.</p>&#13;
<p>This approach isn’t just about making things look neat and tidy. It’s practical, too. It helps you keep your code easy to read and understand. When you need to do that same task again, you can call up your new method instead of rewriting the code. And if there’s ever a glitch, it’s easier to sort out when your code is nicely split up into these focused, bite-sized pieces. It’s about making your life easier and keeping your code clean and organized.</p>&#13;
<p>Here are some prompts for the extract method:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Are there any common pitfalls to avoid when extracting methods in functional programming languages?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I’ve attached a piece of my C# code. Could you suggest which sections would be good candidates for extract method refactoring?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Can you compare my original function and the refactored version with extracted methods? Which is more efficient?</p>&#13;

<h2>Decomposing Conditionals</h2>&#13;
<p>Decomposing conditionals<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="decomposing conditionals" data-type="indexterm" id="id790"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="conditionals, decomposing" data-type="indexterm" id="id791"/> is about breaking down big, gnarly if-then-else statements into something a lot more digestible. You know the kind—those lengthy, twisty conditions that make you squint at your screen trying to figure out what’s going on.</p>&#13;
<p>Let’s say you have an <code>if</code> statement with a complex condition that checks multiple variables and perhaps calls other functions. Instead of trying to decipher this every time, you can extract this condition into a method with a name that clearly describes what the condition is checking. For instance, a condition like <code>if (user.isActive() &amp;&amp; user.hasSubscription() &amp;&amp; !user.isBlocked())</code> can be refactored into a method named <code>canUserAccessContent()</code>. This not only makes your main method cleaner but also instantly makes the code self-explanatory.</p>&#13;
<p>Similarly, the code within the <code>then</code> and <code>else</code> blocks can be extracted into distinct methods. This makes the main flow of your program much more readable. Instead of wading through lines of detailed logic, a reader can now understand the flow at a high level: if this condition is true, do this; otherwise, do that. Each part of the logic lives in its own neatly named method, making it easier to test and modify in isolation.</p>&#13;
<p>Here are some prompts:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Can you explain how to decompose conditionals in Java code for better readability?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How can I break down complex if-then-else statements using the decomposing conditional technique?</p>&#13;

<h2>Renaming</h2>&#13;
<p>Renaming<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="renaming code elements, and refactoring" data-type="indexterm" id="id792"/> functions, variables, and classes might seem like a small change, but it can have a significant impact on the readability and maintainability of code. This is particularly useful in situations where code has evolved over time and original names no longer accurately describe what the code does. For instance, a method initially named <code>processData</code> might become more specialized. Renaming it to something more descriptive, like <code>filterInvalidEntries</code>, can instantly clarify its functionality.</p>&#13;
<p>Writing a prompt for renaming is fairly simple:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What would be a good name for a variable that holds the total number of users in a database in my SQL script?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Here’s a snippet of my JavaScript code. Can you review the variable and method names and suggest improvements?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I’m not sure if the names in my Java class are clear enough. Can you propose better names for clarity?</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>But you need to be cautious, such as when you’re using a tool like Copilot. If you change a name, this can break parts of the code that are still using the old name.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Dead Code" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="dead_code">&#13;
<h2>Dead Code</h2>&#13;
<p>As the name implies, dead code<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="dead code, and refactoring" data-type="indexterm" id="id793"/> is not being used for anything. These are the forgotten lines of code from features that got scrapped or updates that made some parts redundant.</p>&#13;
<p>Scrubbing this dead code from your project makes everything neater and more manageable. It also makes it less confusing for anyone new jumping into your project. They don’t have to scratch their heads over why something’s there if it doesn’t seem to be doing anything.</p>&#13;
<p>Here are some helpful prompts:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Can you help me identify potential dead code in this JavaScript snippet?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Here’s a piece of my Python project. Could you point out any code that seems unused or redundant?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Could you take a look at these SQL procedures and confirm if any of them are safe to delete?</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Note that using an LLM<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="large language models (LLMs)" data-secondary="dead code refactoring considerations" data-type="indexterm" id="id794"/> for this can be risky. Sometimes what looks like an old, dusty corner of code might actually be important for those rare, just-in-case scenarios. Then there’s the domino effect: removing one piece might mess up something else that was relying on it, especially if it’s part of complex logic or setup. So just be <span class="keep-together">cautious.</span></p>&#13;
<p>The other problem is that the generative AI may not truly understand the relationships. So until AI systems get more sophisticated, it’s probably best to avoid using them for rooting out dead code.</p>&#13;
<p>When it comes to dealing with dead code, alternative tools may be a better option. An example is a linter<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="linter, for dealing with dead code" data-type="indexterm" id="id795"/>. Think of this as your code’s tidy-up crew. If you’re working with JavaScript, there’s ESLint. Or for Python fans, there’s Pylint, and the Ruby folks can turn to RuboCop. These tools are like the grammar checkers of coding. They’re awesome at picking up on those pesky syntax mistakes, potential bugs, and, of course, even those sneaky bits of code that aren’t doing anything.</p>&#13;
<p>You’ve also got the heavy-duty inspectors<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="inspectors, code" data-type="indexterm" id="id796"/>: the static code analysis tools. Top providers are SonarQube, Code Climate, and Coverity. These tools are like detectives. They dig through your code without even running it, sniffing out complicated patterns that might be troublemakers down the line, including dead code<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_codingtechniqueswithAIrefactoring.08.129.15" data-type="indexterm" id="id797"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_refactoringwithAI.08.129.15" data-type="indexterm" id="id798"/>.</p>&#13;

<h1>Functions</h1>&#13;
<p>Functions<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="coding techniques with AI" data-secondary="functions" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_codingtechniqueswithAIfunctions.08.204.13"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="functions, AI-assisted coding of" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_functionsAIassistedcodingof.08.204.13"/> are the bread and butter of coding, playing a huge role in any kind of software program, no matter what programming language is used. They’re chunks of code that do wonders for keeping your programs tidy and easy to read since they let you easily reuse code—a lifesaver for any developer. They can also take a big task and break it down into smaller, more manageable bits. This makes dealing with complex software a whole lot easier, especially when you need to fix bugs, make updates, or just try to wrap your head around what the code is doing.</p>&#13;
<p>It’s key to nail functions right from the get-go. Making them work is one thing, but you also need to make sure they play nice with the rest of your code. You want your functions to be clear, easy to keep up with, and efficient. You’ll need to think about what to call each function so that it makes sense, how you’re going to set it up, how it will deal with the data coming in and going out, and how it handles any hiccups.</p>&#13;
<p>To help out, here are some guidelines to keep in mind:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>Think of the single responsibility principle</dt><dd><p>Your function needs to be a specialist in one job—that’s it. This makes it a lot simpler to figure out what it’s doing, check if it’s working right, and fix it if it’s not.</p></dd>&#13;
<dt>Name it clearly</dt><dd><p>Give your function a name that tells you exactly what it does. If it calculates the total price, call it <code>calculateTotalPrice</code>. This makes your code much more <span class="keep-together">readable.</span></p></dd>&#13;
<dt>Keep it short and sweet</dt><dd><p>A good rule of thumb is that you should be able to see the whole function on your screen without scrolling. Short functions are easier to handle and less likely to have bugs.</p></dd>&#13;
<dt>Parameters are key</dt><dd><p>Use parameters for inputs and return values for outputs. This makes your functions predictable and self-contained.</p></dd>&#13;
<dt>Stay consistent</dt><dd><p>Follow the coding conventions and style guidelines of your language or project. This helps keep your code uniform and easy for others to read.</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
<p>When you keep these tips in mind, you can whip up some really effective prompts for functions, and ChatGPT can help. Check out these example prompts:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Write a Python function named calculate_area that takes two integers as parameters, length and width, and returns the area of a rectangle. Include a docstring explaining the function’s purpose and ensure the function handles non-integer inputs by raising a TypeError.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I need a JavaScript function called filterAndTransform. It should take an array of objects as input. Each object has properties name (string) and age (number). The function should return a new array containing the names of people who are 18 years or older, converted to uppercase. Include comments explaining the logic.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Create a C++ function named efficientSort that sorts an array of integers in ascending order. The function should be optimized for time complexity. Provide comments within the function explaining the choice of sorting algorithm and its time complexity.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Can you generate a Java function called safeDivide that takes two double parameters, numerator and denominator, and returns their division? The function should handle division by zero by returning a custom error message. Include Javadoc comments explaining the function and its error handling<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_codingtechniqueswithAIfunctions.08.204.13" data-type="indexterm" id="id799"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_functionsAIassistedcodingof.08.204.13" data-type="indexterm" id="id800"/>.</p>&#13;

<h1>Object-Oriented Programing</h1>&#13;
<p>Object-oriented programming, or OOP<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="coding techniques with AI" data-secondary="object-oriented programming" data-type="indexterm" id="id801"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="object-oriented programming (OOP)" data-type="indexterm" id="id802"/> for short, is a way of writing computer programs using the idea of “objects” to represent data and methods. Think of it like creating a bunch of small, self-contained boxes, each with its own set of tools and information. These boxes, called <em>classes</em>, are like blueprints for creating different objects. A class defines the structure and behaviors of objects—similar to a template. Then from this class, you can create individual <em>objects</em>, each with its own specific details but following the same basic structure.</p>&#13;
<p>Diving into the world of OOP can feel as if you’re stepping into a maze of complex concepts like abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. They can feel like they’re written in an alien language.</p>&#13;
<p>This is where ChatGPT can be your translator<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="translation" data-secondary="programming language" data-type="indexterm" id="id803"/>. It breaks down these complex ideas into bite-sized, easy-to-digest explanations. Struggling with what <em>encapsulation</em> really means? Just ask, and you’ll get an answer that actually makes sense, minus the tech jargon.</p>&#13;
<p>Here are some prompts:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Can you create a simple class in &lt;<em>your preferred programming language</em>&gt; that demonstrates encapsulation?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What are some real-world examples of encapsulation in programming?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Explain abstraction in OOP with an analogy from everyday life.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Can you show me an example of inheritance in a programming scenario?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How does inheritance promote code reuse in OOP?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How does polymorphism enhance flexibility in a program?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> In what scenarios is polymorphism particularly useful, and can you provide examples?</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>AI-assisted programming tools can also be helpful in coming up with the initial structures for classes<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="classes (OOP), AI help with structures for" data-type="indexterm" id="id804"/>. Here are some example prompts:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Design an Employee class with properties like employeeName, employeeID, and department. Implement a method that displays the employee’s details. Also, include a constructor to set these properties.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I need a BankAccount class in Java. It should have private properties like balance and accountNumber. Can you add methods for deposit(), withdraw(), and checkBalance() that modify or access these properties safely?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Could you show me how to create a Vehicle class in C# and then a Truck class that inherits from it? Make sure to include properties like wheels and fuelType and demonstrate the use of different access modifiers.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> In C++, how would I write a FileHandler class that opens a file in its constructor and closes it in its destructor? Also, include methods for writeToFile() and readFromFile().</p>&#13;

<h1>Frameworks and Libraries</h1>&#13;
<p>Diving into software development without frameworks and libraries<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="coding techniques with AI" data-secondary="frameworks and libraries" data-type="indexterm" id="id805"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="frameworks and libraries" data-type="indexterm" id="id806"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="libraries and frameworks" data-type="indexterm" id="id807"/> is like trying to bake a fancy cake from scratch without a recipe or premixed ingredients. It’s possible, but it’s a whole lot harder and takes more time. Frameworks and libraries are the secret sauce that makes a developer’s life easier. Instead of reinventing the wheel every time you need to make a web request or manipulate a DOM element, you just tap into what’s already there.</p>&#13;
<p>AI-assisted programming tools can certainly help. First of all, they can be useful for learning the basic features and workflows. They can also tell you when it’s best to use a framework or library.</p>&#13;
<p>But take their help with a grain of salt. Here’s what Capilnean<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Capilnean, Titus" data-type="indexterm" id="id808"/> has to say:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>Given the large number of updates React gets—as well as other frameworks and libraries—and the fact that we use specific versions of frameworks, I had to provide these as system prompts to my ChatGPT instance in order to optimize my results. Sometimes, GPT provided solutions that were more academic than production-grade, so I tend to rely on working with our senior developers to get the job done for more complex issues. For React, I find myself asking GPT to check my syntax and my method of processing a specific data type more than actually build a full feature for me.</p>&#13;
<p>The same goes for NodeJS. I have to take into consideration our internal APIs and methods of working with our data before I can go to ChatGPT and ask for a code snippet for a feature. Once I am able to describe the output of one of our functions as the input for the feature I am building, it usually is able to provide me with stable code. I use the same process here if the output isn’t good or it errors out. I provide it with the issue and ask for a code update in the right direction.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Data" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="data">&#13;
<h1>Data</h1>&#13;
<p>Data<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="coding techniques with AI" data-secondary="data and databases" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_codingtechniqueswithAIdataanddatabases.08.257.8"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="databases, setting up for code testing" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_databasessettingupforcodetesting.08.257.8"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sample data, setting up for code testing" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_sampledatasettingupforcodetesting.08.257.8"/> is the lifeblood of every application, truly. It’s what keeps an app alive and kicking. Just like blood carries oxygen and nutrients to keep our bodies functioning, data flows through an application, giving it the information and insights it needs to work its magic.</p>&#13;
<p>But creating sample data can be a slog. Picture this: you’re excited to test your shiny new app, but first, you need a bunch of data to see how it actually works in the real world. You start typing in rows and rows of data—names, dates, numbers, whatever it takes. But then, it just keeps going. And going.</p>&#13;
<p>What’s more, you have to be careful about making it realistic enough so your tests are valid, but not so detailed that you’re writing a novel for each entry. And if you need a large dataset? Forget it: you’re basically signing up for a marathon of copy-pasting, tweaking, and double-checking.</p>&#13;
<p>An AI-assisted programming tool can be handy for this. But first, you need to select a database and spin up the schema and tables. The tool will also need to be given the relationships, say, among the tables. Then you will need to do the configuration and setup. But then the AI can begin to help.</p>&#13;
<p>Here are some prompts to get help evaluating databases:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What type of database would be best suited for handling &lt;<em>specific data types or functions, e.g., user interactions, product inventory, etc.</em>&gt;?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> For an app expecting &lt;<em>high/low</em>&gt; traffic with &lt;<em>type of data, e.g., images, text, real-time data</em>&gt;, which database should I consider?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I’m on a tight budget. Can you suggest a cost-effective database solution for a small &lt;<em>type of app, e.g., local delivery service app</em>&gt;?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I’m relatively new to database management. Which databases are user-friendly and easy to maintain for a beginner?</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Here are some prompts to ask for help with a database schema:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Can you help me design a basic database schema for a &lt;<em>type of application, e.g., online store, blog</em>&gt;? I need to know what tables I should create and the primary relationships between them.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What would be an efficient table structure for managing &lt;<em>specific type of data, e.g., customer orders, inventory</em>&gt; in a relational database? What fields and data types should I include?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How should I define the relationships between tables in a relational database for an application that deals with &lt;<em>describe the application’s functionality, e.g., event management, course enrollment</em>&gt;? Specifically, I need help with understanding foreign keys and join tables.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I’m working on a relational database schema for &lt;<em>describe the project</em>&gt;. Could you guide me on setting up primary and foreign keys effectively for data integrity?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What normalization strategy would you recommend for a database handling &lt;<em>type of data or application function</em>&gt;? How can I avoid data redundancy and ensure data integrity?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I’m using a NoSQL database for a &lt;<em>type of project, e.g., social media app</em>&gt;. How should I design the document structures to store &lt;<em>specific data types, e.g., user profiles, posts, comments</em>&gt;?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> In designing my database schema, what indexing strategies should I consider for optimizing query performance, especially for &lt;<em>type of queries or operations, e.g., full-text search, frequent updates</em>&gt;?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I need to migrate an existing database to a new schema. What are the key considerations and steps for redesigning the database structure without losing data <span class="keep-together">integrity?</span></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>And here are some prompts for setting up the initial database environment:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Can you provide step-by-step instructions for installing &lt;<em>a specific database server, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL</em>&gt; on &lt;<em>a specific operating system, e.g., Windows, Linux</em>&gt;?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> After installing &lt;<em>name of database</em>&gt;, what are the essential configuration settings I should initially set up for optimal performance?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What are the best practices for securing a &lt;<em>specific database</em>&gt; server? I’m particularly interested in user authentication and protecting sensitive data.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How can I optimize the performance of &lt;<em>a specific database</em>&gt; for an application that will handle &lt;<em>describe the nature of the data and expected load, e.g., large datasets, high transaction volumes</em>&gt;?</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Now, let’s look at how we can use AI to create sample data. Here are some example prompts:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Create demo data for 100 IDs and email data and save this to a CSV file.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Create demo data for 50 products, including product ID, name, price, and category.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Create a demo dataset of 150 order records, each with an order ID, customer ID, order date, and total amount.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Generate sample data for 100 employees, including employee ID, full name, department, and email address.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Create sample data for 80 customer feedback entries, including feedback ID, customer ID, comments.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>With the data, you can then create SQL statements for it. You can use something like this for the customer feedback entries:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Generate a SQL insert statement to populate the Feedback table with the data.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>ChatGPT can be a lifesaver when it comes to the nitty-gritty task of data conversion<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data conversion, AI assistance with" data-type="indexterm" id="id809"/>. If you’re a developer, you know that converting data between different formats like XML, SQL, JSON, CSV, and TOML is common. But let’s be honest, it can be a tedious and sometimes error-prone process. That’s where ChatGPT comes in handy.</p>&#13;
<p>Here are some sample prompts:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Here’s a CSV row: ‘John Doe, 35, New York’. Can you convert this into an XML format for me?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I have a JSON array like this: [{‘name’: ‘Alice’, ‘job’: ‘Engineer’}, {‘name’: ‘Bob’, ‘job’: ‘Designer’}]. How would I represent this in a SQL table format?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I need to convert this TOML configuration: ‘title = “My Project” owner = “Sara”’ into an equivalent YAML format. How would you convert this?<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_codingtechniqueswithAIdataanddatabases.08.257.8" data-type="indexterm" id="id810"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_databasessettingupforcodetesting.08.257.8" data-type="indexterm" id="id811"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_sampledatasettingupforcodetesting.08.257.8" data-type="indexterm" id="id812"/></p>&#13;

At its core, it uses HTML to set up the basic structure of web pages, CSS to make things look nice and lay out everything, and JavaScript to make it interactive. Nowadays, frontend developers often use frameworks like React and Vue. These frameworks offer features like reusable components and ways to make data update in real time, which allows for building websites and apps that are dynamic and engaging.</p>&#13;
<p>Frontend development can be challenging, even for experienced developers. First of all, there is the unpredictable nature of web browsers and user interactions. You need to deal with different browsers, devices, screen sizes, and user preferences. It’s like trying to make a one-size-fits-all T-shirt that looks good on everyone. Next, the frontend world changes fast. Framework updates pop up frequently.</p>&#13;
<p>Another thing about frontend development is that it’s not just about coding. It’s also a lot about good user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design. This is a unique skill set that many programmers don’t have. UX and UI design involves understanding how people interact with technology, what makes a design visually appealing, and how to create a smooth, logical flow in an app or website. It’s like being part artist, part psychologist. For a lot of traditional programmers, who might be wizards at things like algorithms and data structures, the world of colors, layouts, and user journeys can be unfamiliar territory.</p>&#13;
<p>Regardless, there are ways that AI-assisted programming tools can help out. We’ll look at some of these in the next few sections.</p>&#13;
<section class="pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="CSS" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="css">&#13;

<p>Writing CSS for websites can be tricky, especially when you’re working on big, complex sites. It’s challenging to make sure everything looks good across different browsers<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="browser compatibility issue" data-type="indexterm" id="id813"/> and devices. You’ve got to know all the weird browser-specific quirks. It’s also easy to accidentally mess things up so that one part of your style steps on the toes of another, making things look wonky. Plus, traditional CSS doesn’t let you use variables or functions, which means you end up repeating yourself a lot in your code (though tools like SASS and LESS help with that). Even something as simple as centering a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> can be an ordeal.</p>&#13;
<p>Here are some prompts for common CSS tasks:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Can you provide me with a CSS snippet for a responsive navigation bar that collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile devices?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I’m having trouble with a flexbox layout in CSS where items are not aligning properly. Can you suggest what might be going wrong?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I need to add a hover effect to buttons on my website. Can you show me a CSS example to make the button change color when hovered over?</p>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> I’d like to add a fade-in animation to my website’s homepage. Could you provide a CSS code snippet for this?</p>&#13;

<h2>Creating Graphics</h2>&#13;
<p>Creating professional graphics<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="graphics for websites or apps" data-type="indexterm" id="id814"/> for websites or apps requires an extensive background in design, along with understanding sophisticated tools like Photoshop. But there are many powerful text-to-image generative AI systems that can help you create standout images. Some of these systems include:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p>Canva</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Stable Diffusion</p></li>&#13;

The main products are cakes and cookies, so maybe those could be incorporated into the design. I like pastel colors, especially light pink and mint green. The style should be simple and modern, with a touch of <span class="keep-together">playfulness</span>.</p>&#13;

<p>If you want to make changes to the output, you can continue to prompt ChatGPT. Other AI image tools, like Firefly<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Firefly" data-type="indexterm" id="id815"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Adobe Firefly" data-type="indexterm" id="id816"/>, have more features than ChatGPT for designing images, but ChatGPT can still create compelling images—without much work.</p>&#13;

<h2>AI Tools</h2>&#13;
<p>There are some excellent AI tools that can whip up websites just from a prompt or a picture of what you want the frontend to look like. They’ll handle all the coding for you. This even includes making conversions to frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue. What’s more, an AI tool will also usually be able to import a wireframe, say from Figma.</p>&#13;
<p>After the code is created, you can jump in and tweak things to get it just right. Using AI is an effective shortcut for speeding up the whole website-building process.</p>&#13;
<p>Here are some of the AI tools available:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p>TeleportHQ</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Anima</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Locofy</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>v0 by Vercel</p></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>Let’s take a closer look at v0 by Vercel<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="v0 by Vercel" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_v0byVercel.08.356.44"/>, which is easy to use. In fact, the interface is similar to that of ChatGPT, as you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#this_is_the_interface_for_vzero_by_verce">Figure 8-7</a>.</p>&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="this_is_the_interface_for_vzero_by_verce">&#13;
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0807.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 8-7. </span>This is the interface for v0 by Vercel</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>You can either enter a prompt for the type of interface you want the system to create or upload an image. For this example, I will use a prompt:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> An ecommerce dashboard with a sidebar navigation and a table of recent orders.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>This will take you to a design studio, which will look like <a data-type="xref" href="#the_design_studio_for_vzero_by_vercel_co">Figure 8-8</a>.</p>&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="the_design_studio_for_vzero_by_vercel_co">&#13;
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0808.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 8-8. </span>The design studio that v0 by Vercel comes up with when you enter a prompt</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>The AI will create three versions of the dashboard. You can create additional ones, too. Then, with a prompt, you can make changes, such as to the text size, colors, and so on.</p>&#13;
<p>When you are finished, you can click Code at the upper right. You’ll see a listing of clean React code that’s based on the shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_v0byVercel.08.356.44" data-type="indexterm" id="id817"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tailwind CSS" data-type="indexterm" id="id818"/>.</p>&#13;
<p>There are also several open source systems that use AI to generate frontends. Consider <a href="https://oreil.ly/31Rjd">Screenshot to Code</a>. The creator of this project<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Screenshot to Code GPT" data-type="indexterm" id="xi_ScreenshottoCodeGPT.08.372.175"/> is Abi Raja<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Raja, Abi" data-type="indexterm" id="id819"/>, who is the CEO and founder of Pico. His prior startup was acquired by Yahoo! in 2013.</p>&#13;
<p>Raja spent six months creating the initial codebase for Screenshot to Code. “Frontend developers often convert designs and mock-ups into code,” said Raja. “Much of this work is repetitive. But my software can help automate this process, achieving about 90% of the task.”</p>&#13;
<p>Currently, Screenshot to Code supports exports to React, Bootstrap, and HTML/Tailwind CSS. The project has over 31,000 stars on GitHub.</p>&#13;
<p>With ChatGPT, you can also convert an image to code. Suppose you want to create a calculator app and you want it to look like the version on the iPhone. <a data-type="xref" href="#you_can_input_an_image_of_the_iphone_cal">Figure 8-9</a> shows the image.</p>&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="you_can_input_an_image_of_the_iphone_cal">&#13;
<img alt="" src="assets/aiap_0809.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 8-9. </span>You can input an image of the iPhone calculator app to ChatGPT to generate code</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p>First, we’ll ask ChatGPT to identify the image, which it does correctly. Then we can use this prompt:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> Suggest code for this image</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#chatgpt_created_code_for_the_calculator">Figure 8-10</a> shows the calculator.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>ChatGPT created code for Python. True, the styling is off, but this is still fairly good. Of course, if you want it to look more like the iPhone version, you can be more specific with the prompt, such as by telling ChatGPT to use something like React<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_codingtechniqueswithAIfrontenddevelopment.08.308.24" data-type="indexterm" id="id820"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_webdevelopment.08.308.24" data-type="indexterm" id="id821"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_UIUXuserinterfaceuserexperiencedesign.08.308.24" data-type="indexterm" id="id822"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_ScreenshottoCodeGPT.08.372.175" data-type="indexterm" id="id823"/>.</p>&#13;

<h1>APIs</h1>&#13;
<p>Getting the hang of a new API<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="coding techniques with AI" data-secondary="APIs" data-type="indexterm" id="id824"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="APIs (application programming interfaces)" data-type="indexterm" id="id825"/> can be a challenge. First off, you’ve got to wade through the documentation, which may be dense and technical. And it’s hit or miss with these docs—some are clear and easy to follow, while others...not so much. Then there’s the deal with logging in and getting access, like using API keys or OAuth tokens. Plus, trying to figure out the data structures and response formats the API spits back at you can be overwhelming. Then there is error handling as well as having to keep up with any updates or changes in the API.</p>&#13;
<p>Fortunately, using ChatGPT can make tackling these challenges a bit easier.</p>&#13;
<p>To see how, let’s take a simple example. Suppose you want to use an API to get information about the weather. You can ask ChatGPT for API suggestions:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> What are good weather APIs?</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>One that ChatGPT recommends is OpenWeather API. Next, ask the following:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How do I start using the OpenWeather API?</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>ChatGPT describes the main steps.</p>&#13;
<p>You can then ask it to show how to make a request:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><em>Prompt:</em> How do I create a request using the OpenWeather API? How do I do this using Python?</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">ChatGPT will go through the process, providing details on these steps:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p>Import the requests library.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Define the API key.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Create the API request URL and use the current weather data endpoint.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Execute the request and handle the response.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>Check to see if the request was successful.</p></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;

<h1>Conclusion</h1>&#13;
<p>In this chapter, we dug into modular programming, functions, and object-oriented programming. We also explored how to use AI to learn new languages and frameworks on the fly as well as how to use it to work more efficiently with data. Then we saw how to create compelling frontends<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="xi_codingtechniqueswithAI.08.3.65" data-type="indexterm" id="id826"/>.</p>&#13;
<p>But it’s important to repeat: AI-assisted programming tools are far from perfect. That’s why it’s important to keep your eyes peeled and double-check everything.</p>&#13;
