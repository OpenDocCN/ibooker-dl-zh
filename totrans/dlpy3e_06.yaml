    via a REST API. There are a number of libraries out there for making this happen.
    Keras supports two of the most popular approaches out of the box — *TensorFlow
    Serving* and *ONNX* (short for Open Neural Network Exchange). Both libraries operate
    by lifting all model weights and a computation graph outside of the Python program,
    so you can serve it from a number of different environments (for example, a C++
    server). If this sounds a lot like the compilation mechanism discussed in chapter

    computation graphs with a specific set of saved weights.
