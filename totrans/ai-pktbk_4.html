   <p>Because generative AI can write code, many software engineers—and aspiring ones—have become worried that their careers might be in danger. NVIDIA’s CEO argued it’s no longer necessary to encourage young people to learn how to code. “In fact, it’s almost exactly the opposite,” he said. “It is our job to create computing technologies that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human: everybody in the world is now a programmer—that is the miracle” (<a href="https://mng.bz/GenJ"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/mng.bz/GenJ</span></a>).</p>

   <p>This chapter discusses the possibility that AI may replace the jobs of software engineers and how to protect such jobs. The first three sections discuss three qualities that will help them resist AI: a wide gap between “just fine” and excellent work; the need for stringent validation of the output; and the need for tight control over the output.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p8"> 
   <p>At the beginning of each section, we discuss the topic in general—outside software engineering. I hope this gives you a wider view of the AI affects jobs. At the end of each section, I relate the topic with software engineering specifically and share advice on how engineers can protect their jobs.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p9"> 
   <p>The remainder of the chapter is more speculatory and philosophical. We first discuss how AI could open new doors. Next, we discuss whether AI could cause prolonged mass unemployment and misery, which is something feared by many people.</p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p11"> 
   <p>Some people have asked me whether I thought TV shows would soon be written by AI, thus replacing the job of screenwriters. After speaking with screenwriters, I’ve discovered that the job is often much more complicated than it may seem at first, or at least if you want to do it really well. Screenwriting is not so much about putting words together. Instead, it’s about choosing what to say and how to say it, and some screenwriters go to great lengths to perform this task. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p12"> 
   <p>Consider the case of the spy show <em>Homeland.</em> One of the reasons the show was so popular was that every season spoke about things that were taking place in the world as it aired. As the show was shot months before it aired, the writers had to try to anticipate the things that would be relevant much later.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p13"> 
   <p>For this reason, the writers and crew met intelligence experts to discuss potential storylines for the following year’s season. An article in <em>The Guardian</em> <span class="CharOverride-2">(</span><a href="https://mng.bz/zZRA"><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-3">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-3">/</span><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-3">/mng.bz/zZRA</span></a><span class="CharOverride-2">) </span>explains: </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p14"> 
   <blockquote>
    <div>
     The team began attending an annual “spy camp” . . . absorbing the accumulated insights and knowledge of current and former intelligence agents, diplomatic old hands and, one year, National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden. 
    </div>
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p15"> 
   <blockquote>
    <div>
     [Claire] Danes has fond memories of the spy camps. “The days were long and dense. . . . We’d meet at nine and the revolving door was in constant motion, depositing one story and then another. . . . You really did get to look into a crystal ball from all these amazing sources and get a fairly clear picture of what our reality might be like in a year’s time.”
    </div>
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p16"> 
   <p>To cite another example, consider the sitcom <em>Friends.</em> After the actors rehearsed an episode for many days, it was shot in a single day in front of a live audience. When the audience did not laugh at a joke, the writers asked the audience why. Based on the answers, writers rewrote lines on the spot and asked the audience to pick their favorite alternatives through a show of hands. That’s how they made sure the lines were genuinely funny.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p17"> 
   <p>But not all TV shows are written that carefully. Soap operas, for example, are known to be produced quickly and cheaply. In fact, multiple episodes are usually shot every week. The story­lines across different soap operas are often very similar, as writers try to recycle proven ideas. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p18"> 
   <p>As we can see from these examples, in some jobs, there is a large gap between seeking to achieve excellence, as in <em>Homeland</em> and <em>Friends,</em> and producing content that is just fine, as in soap operas. Let’s call this difference the “excellence gap” (see table 5.1).</p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p20"> 
   <p>In the case of high-budget TV series, the creators want the show to become a legend and stand the test of time—they want to collect royalties years or even decades later. So, writing must be done very carefully, and it takes a lot of time and skill.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p21"> 
   <p>In the case of a soap opera, writing quickly and rehashing existing stories is all that’s needed to do the job effectively. The goal of a soap opera is to provide light entertainment, and the producers rarely intend the show to be rerun. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p22"> 
   <p>I asked a screenwriter whether he thought the profession was threatened by AI. He told me that perhaps repetitive, formulaic writing might be affected, the kind you find in soap operas. However, in higher-profile productions, most of the work isn’t about writing itself but about conducting interviews, doing research, trying out ideas with a test audience, and so on—tasks that the likes of ChatGPT are unlikely to do.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p23"> 
   <p>Note that the excellence gap tends to be filled with activities with a human touch, such as networking, gathering human feedback, building relationships, and so on, for which current AI methods aren’t very suitable. You can sometimes detect these activities by asking someone whether their job can be easily described as a list of steps or a recipe, which can shed light on how easy it is to automate with AI or some other technique. For example, I asked that to a journalist, and she told me that she spent a lot of time trying to come up with creative story angles, and she didn’t think there was a recipe for that. Moreover, a lot of her work involved building good relationships with influential people in her area, so she could reach out to them for commentary when necessary, and she didn’t think there was a step-by-step recipe that described how to do that, either. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p24"> 
   <p>It seems that the jobs that are safest from AI are those on the excellent side of the excellence gap, such as writing higher-end TV shows. Jobs that might suffer from AI are the ones in which the worker specializes on the low end of the gap—the “just fine” part—or there isn’t much of a gap to start with—there isn’t a wide difference between doing it just fine and exceedingly well, the tasks being quite mechanic and easily described as a list of steps.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p25"> 
   <p>Consider the case of writing SEO-driven blog articles whose goal is to drive traffic to a website from Google. For example, a travel agency may want to publish several articles quickly about a travel destination to attract traffic and then sell holidays to internauts or collect commissions from affiliate links. These articles tend to be the “just fine” kind, as the goal is to pack them with relevant keywords, not to provide insightful analyses. I’m sure you’ve seen articles like that. They often have titles such as “20 Things to Do in Paris This Summer (2025).” </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p26"> 
   <p>Until a couple of years ago, it was common to hire humans on platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr to write these blog articles. I now hear that many of these workers are being replaced by AI. As this job only requires “just fine” work—it doesn’t need interviews, research, networking, testing audiences, and similar—AI can do it satisfactorily and faster. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p27"> 
   <p>Other jobs at risk are those in which there may be an excellence gap, but excellence doesn’t have much market value—people are not willing to pay for excellent work because just fine is good enough. I’ve spoken with many professional translators over the past few months, who reached out to me due to concerns regarding their profession. Translators often go to great lengths to produce an excellent translation, which can require a lot of research and creativity. In some cases, however, clients don’t care much about that excellence—they’re okay with a “just fine” translation. For example, I spoke with a group of translators who specialize in translating the content of websites, such as online shops. They seemed to be the ones struggling the most due to AI advancements, as many clients didn’t mind AI translations even if they were a bit flimsy. In other cases, such as literary translation, clients are much more sensitive about the quality of the work and are less likely to be ready to replace professional, human translators with AI.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p28"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"> Excellence gap in software engineering</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p29"> 
   <p>I once worked on a small freelance project where I had to create a dashboard so that a company could visualize some publicly available data more easily. I had to make a few API calls to fetch the data from various sources, transform it a little bit, and plot it. Most of my time was spent coding. The job was rather mechanical, and doing it just fine was okay. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p30"> 
   <p>Now, consider a different piece of work I did a few years ago. I was working for a team that wrote algorithms to put together holiday packages automatically, including determining their prices. The algorithm was meant to design packages automatically and make the process more data driven, hopefully increasing revenue. We built an algorithm that looked good on paper, but we couldn’t deploy it because salespeople had concerns about it. They were scared that, by changing how we put the packages together, we would disrupt our relationship with customers. Moreover, salespeople often priced holidays strategically—for example, instead of trying to make the most revenue, they charged lower-than-revenue-maximizing prices to promote a new travel destination. They were afraid our system would make them lose control over those decisions.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p31"> 
   <p>To reduce friction, we had a discussion with the salespeople to understand their needs, and as a result, we came up with a mathematical gimmick to insert business constraints to our algorithm. Salespeople would be able to adjust these constraints themselves, which would give them much finer control over the holiday packages generated by our tool. Only after this intervention they were happy with it, and we could deploy the system. The success of the project was not just about coding, but about understanding what salespeople wanted and finding a solution that clicked with them. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p32"> 
   <p>Just like in screenwriting, there is an excellence gap in many software engineering projects. In some cases, like the simple dashboard project I mentioned, just fine is okay. The tasks involved in doing these jobs can often be written down as a step-by-step recipe and delegated cheaply. This is the kind of work that AI might be able to replace.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p33"> 
   <p>Excellent software engineering is much more than that. Rather than just writing code as asked, the goal is to help a business solve a problem, as in the case of the package holiday example. The software engineer will work closely with the business to help devise solutions to problems. For example, they will help businesspeople identify features that provide the most added value for the least effort. They will also suggest alternative solutions that the business may have not thought of. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p34"> 
   <p>Moreover, excellent software developers help build robust solutions that stand the test of time. This requires finding the sweet spot between future-proofing and overengineering. For example, should your software handle multiple currencies even if all your users (for now) transact in the same currency? Or should you wait until you expand internationally to add support for other currencies? These are questions you can only answer by discussing and negotiating with the business, which often requires translating technical ideas to a language nontechnical people can understand so you can collaborate.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p35"> 
   <p>In addition, in excellent software development, you must make important decisions to secure the software and protect data. I once worked with a company that was particularly sensitive about accidentally letting one of their clients see data that belonged to another client. Having one isolated database per client is a way to accomplish that, but it can be overkill in some cases. After discussing different possibilities with the business, we settled for having a single database with different compartments in it, or <em>schemas,</em> which provided isolation without so much added complexity. This decision required negotiating with businesspeople.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p36"> 
   <p>As excellent software engineering is not just about writing code but about doing business and exercising soft skills, I think it will be well placed to resist replacement by AI. When businesspeople work alongside software engineers who genuinely help them solve business problems, they’re unlikely to want to automate them away. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p37"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"> Recommendations</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p38"> 
   <p>My advice is that, if you want to future-proof your career, you may want to focus on working at the intersection of technology and business—try to become the person who helps businesses attain their goals using technology, not just a person who writes code. This doesn’t mean you won’t be writing code; it means you’ll be writing the right code to help the business succeed. If you’re asked to add a feature to an app that you think is the wrong one businesswise, you should speak up.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p39"> 
   <p>I recommend you learn about business if you haven’t yet. I’ve found the following books particularly useful:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p40"><em>The Lean Startup</em> <em>by Eric Ries (Crown Currency, 2011</em><em>)</em>—This popular book explains a modern innovation process that relies on experimentation and validation of customer needs. The author popularized the term <em>minimum viable product,</em> or MVP, which is a simple product meant to learn about customers.</li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p41"><em>Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond</em> <em>by Bruce Greenwald et al. (Wiley Finance, 2020</em><em>)</em>—While the book is about investing, the first half describes where the value of a company comes from. It explains, for example, what a <em>competitive advantage</em> truly is and how it adds value to a business. It also explains the importance of future growth and when growth adds value, which is particularly relevant to ambitious, high-growth start-ups. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p42"><em>The E-Myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don’t Work and What to Do About It by Michael E. Gerber (Harper Business, 2004</em><em>)</em>—This classic book helps understand why a solid business is akin to a system that runs automatically, following clearly defined processes.</li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p43"><em>Venture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer and Your Venture Capitalist by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson (Wiley, 2019</em><em>)</em>—This book is useful to understand how financing by venture capitalists works, which is one of the most common sources of financing for technology companies.</li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p44"><em>Value Proposition Design: How to Create Products and Services Customers Want by Alexander Osterwalder et al. (Wiley, 2014</em><em>)</em>—One of the main causes of tech product failure is that people don’t really want the product. This book describes a process to define your target customer and the added value of your solution, which can help prevent that.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p45"> 
   <p>Once you learn about business, I suggest you work your way toward roles that involve both technical and business skills. For example, instead of becoming a deeper specialist on one technology, such as React, you may want to try to take up responsibilities in product management or design alongside your coding work. I advise that you to steer clear of jobs where all you do is pick up a Jira ticket created by someone else and do the technical work described in it.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p46"> 
   <p>You may also want to prioritize working in cross-functional teams that have defined business rather than technical goals. You could, for example, work for an agency (or build your own) that partners up with startups to help them specify, build, and validate products in exchange for money and equity, as opposed to just building whatever product the client wants—no questions asked.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p47"> 
   <p>In addition, you could specialize in a technical field aiming to help attain business goals, such as <em>operations research</em> and <em>data science.</em> One of the main tasks of operations research is to build mathematical optimization algorithms to help solve business problems, such as finding the optimal way of allocating inventory to warehouses based on a demand forecast. This requires mapping a business goal to a mathematical goal, so you’re both a business and a technical person. Moreover, as you can’t efficiently optimize anything, you sometimes need to negotiate with the business to solve a simpler yet useful problem instead.  </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p48"> 
   <p>Although a bit hyped up at times, also data science sits at the intersection between technology and business, as it uses ML to help answer business questions. This is especially true of full-stack data scientists, who help all the way from ideation to building production-level data products. Occupations such as operations research and full-stack data science, in which coding and doing business are tightly coupled, may be in the strongest position to survive advances from AI. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p49"> 
   <p>If you’re absolutely not interested in business and prefer purely technical work, you may want to specialize in a niche technology or problem area and stay up to date with developments—you could become a guru in your field. This might help you stay ahead of AI, as AI learns to code from examples of code available on the internet, which can be outdated or not abundant enough with the latest and most niche technologies. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p50"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">Stringent validation </h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p51"> 
   <p>If you use hotel-booking websites such as <a href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</a>, you may have noticed that hotel reviews from travelers are often translated into your language. This helps you see as many reviews as possible. Instead of hiring humans to translate the reviews, these companies use AI to do so automatically. The outputs generated by AI aren’t verified manually one by one. Sometimes AI hallucinates, so the translations have mistakes or sound a little funny. I just saw the following review on <a href="http://Booking.com:">Booking.com:</a> “Location perfect. Report value for money, nothing to say.” The strange use of the word “report” came from the mistranslation of <em class="CharOverride-6">rapport qualité prix</em> in French, which is a common way of saying “good value for money.”</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p52"> 
   <p>But travelers don’t care much about these mistakes; they want to know whether a hotel is clean, well located, and so on, and they don’t need a perfect translation for that. So, using AI instead of a human translator, presumably one who doesn’t hallucinate, is just fine.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p53"> 
   <p>Another similar example is personalized recommendations on websites, such as which movie to watch next on Netflix or which product to buy on Amazon. Instead of having a marketing specialist analyze customers and create tailor-made recommendations, these are generated at scale and automatically using machine learning trained on past user data. Sometimes these recommendations aren’t quite right. For example, you may be recommended to buy another washing machine after you just bought one, even though washing machines are usually a one-off purchase. But these mistakes don’t matter much, as users will probably not be too fussed about poor recommendations and just ignore them.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p54"> 
   <p>In these cases, the correctness of the output isn’t all that important. So, even though AI may sometimes hallucinate, companies might still choose it instead of hiring human workers (see table 5.2). This is often the case with “nice to have” features that aren’t critical to a company’s core operations, so mistakes don’t matter much. It is also common with large-scale tasks that would be too time-consuming or costly to perform. For example, I think it’s unlikely <a href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</a> would hire humans to translate all hotel reviews on its website. Between having no translated reviews and unvalidated AI-translated reviews, <a href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</a> chooses the latter. </p>

   <p>In other cases, it is much more important to make sure that the output of a job is thoroughly validated. I recently had a conversation with the manager of a team in charge of verifying aircraft maintenance records. He explained that every time a leased aircraft switches hands between different airlines, it is imperative to make sure that all maintenance has been conducted properly. His team oversees going through all the records to verify that. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p57"> 
   <p>Believe it or not, all maintenance records are still held on paper—technicians fill forms manually with a pen, and piles of paper are stored in boxes (yes, in the 21st century). Each country uses different kinds of forms, and they’re often filled in inconsistently, which makes the process of verifying them even more cumbersome. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p58"> 
   <p>A startup built a solution to automate the process using AI. However, the AI system made mistakes sometimes, and this was very difficult to correct due to scarce training data on edge cases. Because of that, a user told me they still had to go through all the papers manually to verify AI’s outputs, so this app didn’t end up saving much time after all. They ended up unsubscribing from the AI service and doing it all by hand as usual. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p59"> 
   <p>Similarly, I once met intelligence staff in the military who were thinking of using AI to identify sensitive targets in satellite images. At that time, they were inspecting the images manually by visually sweeping them using a “Z” pattern. The person in charge of the sweeping was held personally responsible for their observations, so missing a target could compromise their careers. The images covered huge areas, so this was very time-consuming.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p60"> 
   <p>After discussing AI with them, they soon realized it wasn’t possible to guarantee that AI would identify targets with 100% accuracy. Maybe it would identify more targets than humans, but the possibility existed that it would sometimes randomly miss a target a human could see. To them, this meant they would still have to sweep the entire image manually to double-check that AI hadn’t missed anything. So, AI wouldn’t speed up the process whatsoever. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p61"> 
   <p>Aircraft maintenance and military operations were examples of work that is too sensitive to leave to AI without double-checking it (see table 3.2). Other sensitive professions that require stringent validation are those of lawyers and doctors, as small mistakes can lead to lost licenses or malpractice lawsuits. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p62"> 
   <p>Even in other fields in which mistakes may not be as devastating, they can be harmful commercially, so humans will still be involved in validating AI’s outputs manually. An example of this is Amazon’s automated grocery shops. These stores, which opened in the United States and the United Kingdom, allegedly used video cameras and AI to automatically detect what a customer picked from the shelves, so logged-in users could just walk out of the store without going to the cash desk, and they received a receipt on their email later. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p63"> 
   <p>As is often the case, AI sometimes hallucinated, so the receipts contained mistakes. But Amazon wouldn’t want those receipts to ever reach customers, as it would be very harmful for the business’s reputation. So, Amazon secretly hired an army of 1,000 people who watched the videos remotely and validated AI’s outputs (<a href="https://mng.bz/0Qnv"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/mng.bz/0Qnv</span></a>). Thus, instead of eliminating the jobs of human cashiers, Amazon moved them elsewhere. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p64"> 
   <p>Jobs in which outputs must be thoroughly validated due to legal, safety, or commercial reasons are safer from being automated away by AI, as a human expert must still be involved in the loop. In some cases, there may be productivity gains from using AI and validating its output instead of doing the work manually. For example, perhaps AI might help draft legal contracts quickly, which lawyers will have to verify word by word (remember the unfortunate story of the lawyer who filed a document in court rife with AI hallucinations), but this two-step process will be quicker than writing the contract without AI. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p65"> 
   <p>In some other cases, however, the overall productivity gains will not be consequential because the validation process will be cumbersome. As illustrated by the story of aircraft maintenance records and Amazon checkouts, AI often saves much less time overall—or even makes things worse—than people initially thought.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p66"> 
   <p>Some professionals have told me their clients are pressuring them to use AI to work more quickly and even charge lower rates. According to the clients, now AI can do your work and you just have to validate it, so it should be faster and cheaper. For example, translators have told me that many of their clients are now asking them to be editors of AI-translated text instead of translating the text from scratch, and they want to pay less for that. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p67"> 
   <p>Perhaps in some professions, productivity gains will indeed be observed. However, there are some early indicators that it may not be happening as much as expected, and validation may be the culprit. A survey conducted by Upwork <span class="CharOverride-2">(</span><a href="https://mng.bz/KGXO"><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-3">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-3">/</span><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-3">/mng.bz/KGXO</span></a><span class="CharOverride-2">) </span>revealed that</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p68"> 
   <blockquote>
    <div>
     Nearly half (47%) of workers using AI say they have no idea how to achieve the productivity gains their employers expect. Over three in four (77%) say AI tools have decreased their productivity and added to their workload in at least one way. For example, survey respondents reported that they’re spending more time reviewing or moderating AI-generated content (39%), invest more time learning to use these tools (23%), and are now being asked to do more work (21%). Forty percent of employees feel their company is asking too much of them when it comes to AI.
    </div>
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p69"> 
   <p>So, when the correctness of outputs is of paramount importance, either for safety, legal, or commercial reasons, it is unlikely that AI will completely replace human work, or at least it won’t be the case as long as AI isn’t 100% accurate. It might be the case, however, that some workers will find themselves being hired for lower rates to validate AI’s outputs instead of generating them themselves, although the payoff of this may not always be as good as it may initially seem.</p>

   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"> Validation in software engineering</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p71"> 
   <p>Compared to other fields in which a small mistake can go unnoticed, software bugs are often amplified—one minor bug can break an entire application. Notably, in July 2024, a bug in an update of security software CrowdStrike caused major disruption globally, including grounding planes and disabling fire alerts in buildings. The damages are estimated to be in the billions of dollars (<a href="https://mng.bz/YD0e"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/mng.bz/YD0e</span></a>).</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p72"> 
   <p>That’s why software is usually validated thoroughly. Companies often ask developers to unit-test their own code and review one another’s code. They also have automated tests in the deployment pipeline and separate quality assurance (QA) teams to independently validate the software.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p73"> 
   <p>If AI generated flawless software, then validation would perhaps no longer be necessary. But is that so?</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p74"> 
   <p>The code generated by LLMs tends to be syntactically correct—it compiles just fine. However, it sometimes doesn’t solve the intended problem correctly, or it crashes at runtime. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p75"> 
   <p>A software engineer performed a series of tests to understand LLMs’ code-writing capabilities. In his first experiment, he asked ChatGPT to fetch publicly available data from traffic cameras in Singapore and show them on a map (<a href="https://mng.bz/jpRe">https://mng.bz/jpRe</a>). This was the prompt:</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text prompt" id="p76"> 
   <p><strong class="prompt-head-image"><img alt="image" src="../Images/Prompt-Icon.png" width="4%"/></strong> You can get JSON data containing traffic images, camera id and location (longitude and latitude) by calling traffic images API, <a href="https://api.data.gov.sg/v1/transport/traffic-images">https://api.data.gov.sg/v1/transport/traffic-images</a>. Show on a map (using OpenStreetMaps) where all cameras are, with the corresponding traffic image, camera id and the date and time of the image. Call the traffic images API to refresh the data and repopulate the map every 1 minute. Only use Javascript embedded within the map html file for this and nothing else.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p77"> 
   <p>In just one attempt, ChatGPT produced a piece of code that did exactly what it was asked to do. This was certainly impressive.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p78"> 
   <p>The software engineer then tried to augment the functionality of this map by also showing weather data on it:</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text prompt" id="p79"> 
   <p><strong class="prompt-head-image"><img alt="image" src="../Images/Prompt-Icon.png" width="4%"/></strong> The 2-hour weather forecast for Singapore can be found through the Weather API, <a href="https://api.data.gov.sg/v1/environment/2-hour-weather-forecast">https://api.data.gov.sg/v1/environment/2-hour-weather-forecast</a>, which returns JSON data that includes the name of the location, the longitude and latitude of the location and the weather forecast of the loca­tion in the next 2 hours. Display the information on the map that was previously returned by modifying it. Use a marker with a weather icon to indicate the weather station.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p80"> 
   <p>This time, ChatGPT’s code didn’t work correctly. After some debugging, the engineer realized it was because the LLM had assumed that the weather API returned data in a format that was not the right one. So, the engineer modified the prompt to indicate more explicitly the format of the data returned by the API. It then worked correctly. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p81"> 
   <p>The engineer learned from this experience and, in subsequent experiments, he made sure to write more detailed prompts to prevent ChatGPT from making wrong assumptions. Even then, the code wasn’t correct all the time. For example, it persistently outputted the wrong URL to the CDN of a library.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p82"> 
   <p>The engineer acknowledged that ChatGPT was useful and could help you learn how to perform certain tasks. However, he argued <span class="CharOverride-2">(</span><a href="https://mng.bz/jpRe"><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-3">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-3">/</span><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-3">/mng.bz/jpRe</span></a><span class="CharOverride-2">)</span>:</p>

   <blockquote>
    <div>
     If you make assumptions about ChatGPT, it will make assumptions too aka hallucinate and make up stuff. The made-up stuff is just as elaborate and believable. . . . Most of the time, you’ll need to debug the code, especially if you are not very specific. . . . Using ChatGPT to debug code can be enlightening or disastrous. It can be enlightening because it can give you pointers to the issue, even issues it created in the first place, and sometimes even fix it for you. It can be disastrous because it can also lead you down a rabbit hole that never ends by giving you wrong pointers and red herrings, and it will sound super-confident at every step of the way.

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p84"> 
   <p>As we can see from these examples and the author’s reflections, we can’t completely trust AI-generated code. We still need to validate and debug its outputs, and the expertise of a software engineer is required to do so. In addition, the prompts that work best are the ones filled with technical details, so software engineers are the ones who can craft the most effective prompts. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p85"> 
   <p>That’s why I find it unlikely that companies will automate away software engineers with AI-generated code. However, it may happen that some companies, persuaded by potential productivity gains, will try to turn software engineers into validators of AI-generated code. Just like in the case of translators, they may expect to pay lower rates to engineers or have them do more work, as they’d be just proofreading the AI-generated code instead of writing it. Let’s see ways in which you can avoid that.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p86"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"> Recommendations</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p87"> 
   <p>Let’s first go over some observations and recommendations about traditional software development. I will then add recommendations regarding the validation of AI-based products.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p88"> 
   <p>I’ve heard of software development teams that dedicate most of their time to the implementation of new features, and they deprioritize testing them or leave testing for later or for others to do. While these teams produce code, they often do so unreliably. I wouldn’t be surprised if business managers tried to automate them away using AI.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p89"> 
   <p>To protect your job, I recommend that you specialize in delivering robust software. This requires many more duties than just writing code. For example, you may spend a large and perhaps greater portion of your work making sure that your code is robust to edge cases and unfortunate situations. Even if AI can write some code for you, that is only a small portion of your duties. Your employer will see you as a person who delivers holistic and robust code that stands the test of time.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p90"> 
   <p>For that, I recommend joining modern software development teams that are validation driven; they intertwine development and testing and try to deliver robust software off the bat. These teams make validation central and tightly coupled to the development process, as opposed to a secondary task.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p91"> 
   <p>I also recommend that you learn about <em>test-driven development,</em> or <em>TDD</em><em>,</em> which has become extremely popular. In TDD, you divide your code into small units and spend time to think of edge cases or things that could go wrong with each unit. You then write individual tests for all these things that could go wrong, and you make sure that your code passes the tests (some people even write the tests before writing the code). I often advise others to write a test case instead every time they’re tempted to run the software to see if it works well, perhaps using a “print” statement. This way, the test stays in the code base forever and can be helpful in catching problems later. But you don’t want to overdo it. Part of your responsibility as a test-driven developer is to find the sweet spot between coding and testing—you shouldn’t spend too much time writing outlandish tests to cover scenarios that are extremely unlikely to happen.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p92"> 
   <p>I also recommend you learn about <em>trunk-based development,</em> which is an increasingly popular way of organizing software teams. Before trunk-based development, each coder worked on a separate branch of the main code branch. After finishing, peers reviewed the software (in a “pull request”) before it was merged into the main code. Coding and validation were thus quite separate activities.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p93"> 
   <p>In trunk-based development, coders directly push their updates to the main code branch without peer review (some may use short-lived feature branches). For this to work, you must adopt a set of work practices to prevent breaking the production app. For example, you may use a mechanism known as a <em>feature flag</em> to direct most users to the old version of the code and only a handful of users, such as yourself and the quality assurance team, to the new version. You only remove the old code and point every user to the new one once you validate that your new feature works as expected. Moreover, the deployment pipeline must contain plenty of automated tests. You can learn more about this process on <a href="http://trunkbaseddevelopment.com"><span class="Hyperlink">trunkbaseddevelopment.com</span></a>.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p94"> 
   <p>When implementing modern work practices, such as TDD and trunk-based development, the job of coders is not just to write code but to help continuously deliver robust software. This involves a lot more than just writing code that implements new features, so AI may not affect it all that much.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p95"> 
   <p>In addition, you may want to learn how to build and deploy apps holistically, including DevOps and management of cloud infrastructure, for example. This will strengthen your position as a person who delivers robust software end to end and not just a coder, helping you stay relevant in an era when AI can write some code.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p96"> 
   <p>Let’s now move on to AI-based products, which are all the rage. These products impose additional requirements in terms of validation, as AI sometimes hallucinates or produces different outputs on different executions. How can you properly measure the accuracy of an AI-based product in performing a task? And how can you find opportunities to improve it? </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p97"> 
   <p>Over the past few months, many people have approached me to ask for advice about their AI-based products because they were disappointed with AI’s performance. This included both developers and entrepreneurs. In addition to the odd hallucination, they often complained that AI lacked consistency. For example, a company created an AI model to generate recommendations to improve marketing videos. The users would implement one of the recommendations and then run the video again through the app, but now the app would make completely different recommendations and forget some of the previous ones. This was frustrating to users.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p98"> 
   <p> In most cases, I soon noticed the developers weren’t following a systematic process to validate and select AI models. For example, they didn’t have a benchmark to assess the performance of different models at the task or how performance improved as the prompt changed. Moreover, they summarized the entire task in one single mega-prompt and hoped for the best. I encouraged them to divide the problem into smaller units and conduct thorough benchmarking. This would help diagnose the problem and identify individual subtasks that could be improved, perhaps bringing in some external data or even not using AI at all. In addition, benchmarking could help build realistic assumptions about performance and see how close you are to what’s acceptable—AI will rarely work just the way you want 100% of the time. In chapter 3, we discussed the preferred process for validation and selection of models, which gives you an idea of how AI could perform in the future and avoid unfortunate biases that can arise from poor handling of the validation process.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p99"> 
   <p>I expect there will be an increasing need for developers to work on validating AI’s performance and finding opportunities for improvement. Why not become a guru of AI-based product validation to stay ahead of the curve?</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p100"> 
   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2"> Tight control</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p101"> 
   <p>A graphic designer told me she was trying to use AI to generate an image but was struggling to do so effectively as she couldn’t get it to look <em>exactly</em> the way she wanted. As she had very specific requirements about the image, the prompt had become very detailed and long, which made it hard to manage. AI sometimes randomly ignored some instructions in the prompt, so she had to rephrase or rearrange it to try to have AI heed the requests. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p102"> 
   <p>The designer told me, “I must be doing something wrong. I need to read the user manual.” It is true that the user manual may have provided her with some useful directions and tricks to write an effective prompt. For example, Midjourney’s documentation <span class="CharOverride-2">(</span><a href="https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts"><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-3">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-3">/</span><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-3">/docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts</span></a><span class="CharOverride-2">) </span>explains:</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p103"> 
   <blockquote>
    <div>
     It is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t want. If you ask for a party with “no cake,” your image will probably include a cake. To ensure an object is not in the final image, try advanced prompting using the 
     <code>--no</code> parameter. . . .Word choice matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances. Instead of big, try tiny, huge, gigantic, enormous, or immense. . . . Plural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. “Three cats” is more specific than “cats.” Collective nouns also work, “flock of birds” instead of “birds.” 
    </div>
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p104"> 
   <p>While these tips and tricks may have indeed helped the designer, they’re still rules of thumb that don’t work every time. It’s unlikely that, just by following these recommendations, the designer would have easily controlled AI’s output the way she wanted. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p105"> 
   <p>This experience is very different from that of an owner of an e-commerce website. He explained to me that he sometimes runs quick ad campaigns on Instagram to test a new product or refine its sales copy. Until a couple of years ago, he hired people to create graphics for these ads or did it himself. Now he uses AI. As he doesn’t care much about the exact look of these graphics, such as the colors or images in them, he writes very simple prompts and often obtains an acceptable result in one go. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p106"> 
   <p>Similarly, as I write this book, the editors have been creating videos to summarize its content. They’ve been using AI for it. They don’t need full control over the look of the videos, such as colors, design, layout, and so on. They just need to verify that the content makes sense. So, AI is very effective because a simple prompt can take you a long way. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p107"> 
   <p>Generative AI works best when we don’t want to tightly control its output, as you can obtain useful outputs without having to refine and refine the prompt (see table 5.3). When you’re not very picky about the end result, you get “good bang for your prompt.”</p>

   <p>In other cases, we want to have much more control over AI’s output, as we have a stronger idea of what we want to produce. In this case, generative AI may not save that much time, if any at all, as the process of precisely describing what you want in the prompt and getting AI to do it might be as complicated as doing the work manually.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p110"> 
   <p>So, jobs in which clients don’t care much about the precise details of the output are the ones most at risk of being replaced by AI. For example, a designer who specializes in creating graphics cheaply for quick ad campaigns may need to worry. Jobs where clients have very precise requirements about outputs are the ones that may resist AI better. In these cases, AI may be of some assistance, but the worker will still have to do a lot of work to get the output as intended. For example, a visual effects artist who works for high-end movie productions, in which directors are very demanding, is more likely to resist AI.</p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p112"> 
   <p>A few months ago, I had to quickly come up with a color palette to display lines using different colors in a line chart. The palette had to be defined as a JavaScript list of colors represented by hexadecimal strings. I asked ChatGPT the following:</p>

  <div class="readable-text prompt" id="p113"> 
   <p><strong class="prompt-head-image"><img alt="image" src="../Images/Prompt-Icon.png" width="4%"/></strong> give me a color palette for a graph written as a Javascript list of hex values. there should be 20 different colors </p>

   <p>When it comes to writing code, AI is most useful when we can succinctly describe the task and don’t care so much about the exact output. So, we get good bang for our prompt. Note how sloppily written my prompt was, yet ChatGPT managed to produce code I could readily use. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p118"> 
   <p>But not all coding tasks are like this. In fact, most often, we do care a lot about the fine details of the software we write, and stakeholders have strong opinions of how our software should tackle a problem, what its interface should look like, and so on. For example, we may need it to use a specific algorithm or a specific external API to gather data, or we way need a frontend interface to respond to different screen sizes in a specific way. As a software project grows, it often becomes more customized and unique. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p119"> 
   <p>The more requirements you have about your code, the more writing an AI prompt for it becomes like coding itself, as you must define the solution step-by-step. This is one of the reasons why no-code, drag-and-drop tools to write software have never replaced programming. At one point, when you need to customize a no-code app, you end up having to either code or write step-by-step instructions using the no-code platform’s capabilities, which is a lot like coding, thus defeating the purpose of no-code in the first place.</p>

   <p>After NVIDIA’s CEO argued that programming will now be done using human language, technology educator John Crickett pointed out, “How will we ever specify complex software in a language as imprecise, vague and open to interpretation as ‘Human’? I’ve never met a product owner who has been able to do it in English. I certainly can’t” (<a href="https://mng.bz/W2KW"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/mng.bz/W2KW</span></a>). AI might be a tool that can aid engineers, but they will still have to use precise, step-by-step technical language to define what code must do. </p>

   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"> Recommendations</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p122"> 
   <p>I recommend avoiding software jobs that involve building experimental products for which details don’t matter much—we can think of them as toy products. One example is building quick prototypes for entrepreneurs who want to test an app idea with potential users. These clients often don’t care about the scalability or future-proofing of the solution. They want you to build something quickly so they can show it to users and gather feedback. If they collect evidence that there’s a real need for the product, they often throw away the initial prototype and hire engineers to build a more serious product afterward. Many of these entrepreneurs are now using no-code app builders such as Bubble or FlutterFlow, without hiring engineers, to build the apps themselves. We could imagine they’ll increasingly rely on AI tools and become less inclined to hire engineers for their early-stage projects.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p123"> 
   <p>Instead, try to work on demanding projects for very picky clients. Some clients are extremely sensitive about small details and want things done in a certain way. This often derives from the demands of their own users who are perfectionists and complain about small things. You might observe this the most when building software for mission-critical applications, such as coordinating logistics operations. </p>

   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">A new opportunity: Making the web more human</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p125"> 
   <p>Do you ever add the word “reddit” to your search queries on Google? I do that all the time, and it seems that there’s an increasing number of people who do that, too. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p126"> 
   <p>For example, I recently went to the city of Belfast and wondered whether it was worth visiting Titanic Belfast, a museum built on the site where the ocean liner was built. I knew that an ordinary Google search would send me to countless SEO-driven articles with titles such as “Top 5 reasons to Visit Titanic Belfast.” These articles, packed with keywords to drive traffic, would be poorly curated and filled with affiliate links to try to sell me something. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p127"> 
   <p>Instead, I searched “Titanic Belfast worth visiting reddit,” as I wanted to know what redditors had to say on the matter. I knew opinions would differ, and perhaps redditors would fight and downvote each other, but at least I’d have a higher chance of discovering what genuine human beings thought about the museum. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p128"> 
   <p>Software engineer Dmitri Brereton argues, “Why are people searching Reddit specifically? The short answer is that Google search results are clearly dying. The long answer is that most of the web has become too inauthentic to trust” (<a href="https://dkb.blog/p/google-search-is-dying"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/dkb.blog/p/google-search-is-dying</span></a>).</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p129"> 
   <p>People seem to be craving more genuine, human content on the web. I think that, if AI-written content floods the web, it will make the problem even worse. People will flock to online venues where they can find more genuine content. If AI-made content proliferates on platforms such as Google, Medium, and YouTube, they may find themselves in trouble as users flee them. Some of them, such as YouTube, have already started cracking down on AI-generated content (<a href="https://mng.bz/8OgD"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/mng.bz/8OgD</span></a>).</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p130"> 
   <p>So, if you allow me some speculation, I think that the generative AI revolution may create new types of jobs to help rank and filter content based on its authenticity. For example, a new specialty may be in writing software to detect AI-generated content. This may lead to new developments and interest in the field of information retrieval. </p>

   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">Philosophical detour: Automation and mass unemployment</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p132"> 
   <p>Since the rapid development of generative AI, some people have been concerned about the possibility that it would cause mass unemployment in the wider economy (<a href="https://mng.bz/EarR"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/mng.bz/EarR</span></a>). This concern isn’t new—it’s been voiced many times in history when machines or new techniques that automated work were introduced. As a technologist, you may often find yourself discussing the effects of your own work in the grand scheme of things—does building new technology hurt the economy?</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p133"> 
   <p>Indeed, new machines and techniques do cause people to lose their jobs. This is very unfortunate, as workers find themselves with obsolete skills and have to search for new jobs, perhaps for lower pay. But what is the overall effect of machines on an economy—do they generate prolonged mass unemployment and widespread misery? To answer this question, let’s discuss economics.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p134"> 
   <p>We can think of an economy as a process that takes resources and converts them into real outputs (products and services):</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p135"> 
   <blockquote>
    <div>
     Resources (minerals, energy, workers’ time) —&gt; Products (e.g., food, Netflix series) and services (e.g., doctor’s care, haircut).
    </div>
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p136"> 
   <p>The total output of an economy is measured by its GDP (more precisely, the GDP adjusted for inflation, or real GDP). Countries with a higher per-capita GDP produce more stuff for their inhabitants. This often means they enjoy a higher standard of living. The GDP of a country grows when it finds ways to produce more stuff, for example, by using more advanced production techniques or by building machines that automate away part of the manual work. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p137"> 
   <p>When an economy doesn’t benefit from machines, many worker hours are required to produce essential items like food and clothes. When it accumulates machines, fewer hours are required to produce the same stuff, so more items can be produced, and they become cheaper. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p138"> 
   <p>The use of technology frees up resources, including human work hours, which can be used to innovate and produce nonessential things, such as entertainment and TV series. A 2022 study revealed that “roughly 60% of employment in 2018 is found in job titles that did not exist in 1940” (<a href="https://mng.bz/N1rd"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/mng.bz/N1rd</span></a>). So, while automation eliminates jobs, ultimately the economy accommodates the freed-up resources to the production of other stuff, perhaps things that weren’t produced before and that aren’t as essential to survive. Automation, provided that it uses resources efficiently, makes an economy richer, not poorer. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p139"> 
   <p>In his book <em class="CharOverride-6">Economics in One Lesson</em> (Harper &amp; Brothers, 1946), journalist Henry Hazlitt explained:</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p140"> 
   <blockquote>
    <div>
     If it were indeed true that the introduction of labor-saving machinery is a cause of constantly mounting unemployment and misery, the logical conclusions to be drawn would be revolutionary, not only in the technical field but for our whole concept of civilization. Not only should we have to regard all further technical progress as a calamity; we should have to regard all past technical progress with equal horror. . . . Why should freight be carried from New York to Chicago by railroads when we could employ enormously more men, for example, to carry it all on their backs? . . . What machines do, to repeat, is to bring an increase in production and an increase in the standard of living.
    </div>
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p141"> 
   <p>The conundrum is that, even if automation improves economic development overall, the transition is harsh for the people who lose their jobs in the process. Henry Hazlitt goes on to argue:</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p142"> 
   <blockquote>
    <div>
     We should keep at least one eye on Joe Smith. He has been thrown out of a job by the new machine. . . . Now he has become overnight an unskilled workman again, and can hope, for the present, only for the wages of an unskilled workman, because the one skill he had is no longer needed. We cannot and must not forget Joe Smith. His is one of the personal tragedies . . . incident to nearly all industrial and economic progress.
    </div>
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p143"> 
   <p>I don’t think generative AI is as big a step as people claim in terms of helping us produce stuff more efficiently. As we saw, AI hallucinates and its outputs often need to be thoroughly validated. In addition, as we’ll discuss later, it consumes quite a lot of electricity and other natural resources. However, it does seem to be helping perform certain tasks more efficiently in a variety of industries. This will create economic growth, not misery, in the long run, just like so many other machines have done in the past. Some people will lose their jobs in the process, and this will certainly be harsh for them. But we should not fall prey to the idea that new technology causes widespread and prolonged misery. It’s quite the opposite.</p>

   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">Summary</h2> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text buletless-item" id="p145">Jobs in which excellent work is noticeable and appreciated are likely to resist AI better. In software engineering, one way to achieve that is to work at the intersection between technology and businesses—you partner with businesspeople to help them build successful products, as opposed to just coding. Some suggestions to accomplish that are the following: 
    <ul> 
     <li class="readable-text">Learn about business, for example, by reading popular business books like <em>Lean Startup</em>.</li> 
     <li class="readable-text">Be involved in tasks beyond technical ones, such as product management or business analysis.</li> 
     <li class="readable-text">Specialize in a technical field designed to help businesses attain their goals, such as operations research and data science.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li class="readable-text buletless-item" id="p146">Jobs requiring a stringent and detailed validation of the output, either for safety, legal, or commercial reasons, will better resist AI. This tends to be the case with software, but some people may want to turn engineers into validators of AI-written code. Some ideas to remain relevant are 
    <ul> 
     <li class="readable-text">Become a person whose job is to deliver reliable software, not just code.</li> 
     <li class="readable-text">Work in modern teams that constantly intertwine coding and testing. If you haven’t already, learn about modern engineering practices like test-driven development (TDD) and trunk-based development.</li> 
     <li class="readable-text">Learn how to build and software holistically, including deployment, cloud, and DevOps.</li> 
     <li class="readable-text">Learn good practices to evaluate AI-based products (see chapter 5). Help your clients understand the performance of AI at their intended tasks and help them find opportunities for improvements.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li class="readable-text buletless-item" id="p147">Jobs that require fine control over the output may resist AI better, as AI is most helpful when you’re ready to accept its outputs without having to refine them much. Some ideas to protect your job are 
    <ul> 
     <li class="readable-text">Avoid specializing in building rough prototypes or “toy products,” as required by early-stage entrepreneurs for idea validation.</li> 
     <li class="readable-text">Try to work with picky clients who want things done in a certain way. You might have the highest chances of finding this kind of client when building software for mission-critical applications.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p148">The proliferation of generative AI may create new software jobs to build algorithms that will help cope with the newly generated content (e.g., by helping filter and retrieve content written by humans).</li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p149">Those whose professions are affected by AI will suffer through the transition to a new profession. However, if AI were to truly automate jobs efficiently, rather than cause prolonged unemployment and misery, it will make our economies more efficient and prosperous.</li>
