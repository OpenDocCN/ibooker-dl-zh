   <p>This chapter includes a short checklist to use when determining whether AI will work well for you. The list contains seven questions, which I hope can help you unveil the challenges and opportunities of using AI. The first three questions are framed within the context of building an AI-based, production-level product, such as a travel-planning app based on a large language model (LLM). I hope these questions will help you determine whether a certain AI-based product could be successful before building it.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p6"> 
   <p>The following three questions are framed within the context of using conversational AI in daily work, such as an LLM to help you code. I hope they will help you figure out whether AI is a valuable addition to your workflow. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p7"> 
   <p>Finally, the last question concerns the new practice of building apps in the form of LLM wrappers, in which an LLM does the job under the hood, and the app manages the LLM. This question is intended to help you determine whether this approach will be suitable for your needs.</p>

   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">Building an AI-based product</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p9"> 
   <p>This section contains three questions to be kept in mind when building an AI-based product. The first question is business related. It might seem odd to think about business when deciding whether to use AI. However, in my experience, the failure to do so leads to many unsuccessful AI projects. So, I think that wondering whether there’s a business case for AI is a good place to start. The other two questions are technical.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p10"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"> Am I putting AI before the customer?</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p11"> 
   <p>An employee of a startup reached out to me once for advice. His company, which built accounting software, was looking to add a ChatGPT-based feature to its app, but they didn’t know what that could be. He asked me if I could help him come up with possible features based on ChatGPT that they could add. I asked him why he wanted a ChatGPT-based feature in the first place, and he explained, “We’re trying to raise funding, and we cannot tell investors that we’re not using ChatGPT for something.”</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p12"> 
   <p>This is how many AI-based projects start—people decide to use AI due to hype, FOMO, funding opportunities, and so on, without necessarily knowing what they will use AI for. They have a hammer, and they’re searching for nails. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p13"> 
   <p>The problem with this approach is that you often end up building products that people don’t really need. A stellar example is the fancy AI-powered supermarket checkout technology developed by Amazon. This technology, called “Just Walk Out,” was meant to use AI to analyze videos and automatically prepare shoppers’ receipts—the shoppers didn’t need to visit a checkout counter.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p14"> 
   <p>Amazon first developed a similar technology for its own warehouses, which helped track items picked by workers from shelves. After developing this technology, Amazon wondered what else it could do. The company had a hammer, and it started searching for nails.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p15"> 
   <p>The nail they came up with was the supermarket checkout process. Instead of responding to an actual shopper need, Amazon pushed this technology into grocery shopping, as if the technology by itself would be appealing enough. Here’s an excerpt from my book, <em>Siliconned</em> (Applied Maths, 2024), where I discussed the problem:</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p16"> 
   <blockquote>
    <div>
     The reception of the shops by the public was lukewarm. It appeared that people didn’t care as much about fancy checkout technology as they cared about finding the best shopping deals. A business consultant explained, “Retailers must also provide competitive pricing and an enjoyable customer experience. Just Walk Out isn’t enough.” … I always struggled to understand what problem Amazon was trying to solve for shoppers. Were shoppers really that annoyed about checkouts that they’d flock to Amazon Go shops just to avoid it? … If it was about reducing the cost of operating a supermarket and thus offer better deals, it was also unclear how the technology would accomplish that, as supermarkets with the Just Walk Out technology required as many employees to run as regular supermarkets with self-checkout machines, plus the cost of installing and running the complicated technology.
    </div>
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p17"> 
   <p>As this technology didn’t seem to meet real needs, Amazon ended up suspending its development and closing many of its shops.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p18"> 
   <p>The increasing popularity of AI has led many people to adopt an AI-first approach, in which they try to find use cases for AI instead of first trying to understand what customers want. For example, I know a company that created a team exclusively dedicated to finding things to do with AI within the organization. I also know companies that hired dozens of people for newly created AI teams without knowing exactly what these teams would do with AI—they thought that, as AI seemed so promising, they would surely find something to do with it.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p19"> 
   <p>Another example of an AI-first approach is a large portion of the self-driving car industry. Many self-driving car companies were born because people observed that AI had become much more powerful at image categorization, thanks to convolutional neural networks. So, they thought it was the right time to develop self-driving cars, and they raised billions from investors promising big profits. In many cases, however, these startups didn’t know which problem self-driving cars would solve for customers, or how they’d turn them into commercially viable products. Often, the approach was, “If you build it, they will come.”</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p20"> 
   <p>While this approach where AI is put before the needs of customers might work sometimes, it goes against prevailing wisdom in the fields of entrepreneurship and innovation. These fields have increasingly adopted a customer-centric approach. For example, the popular <em>lean</em> movement suggests one should build a minimal product early on—perhaps a prototype or a mock-up—to show to customers and learn about their genuine needs before going all-in on a solution. </p>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p23">

    <div>

  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p24"> 
   <blockquote>
    <div>

    </div>
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p25"> 
   <p>Unless you work in pure research or other noncommercial pursuits, my advice is to adopt an entrepreneurship mindset. Try to ensure you understand your customers and find the best solution to their problems—it may or may not be AI. For example, if you’re asked to build an AI-based product because AI is trendy, if possible, go back to the drawing board to understand what the real need is and whether an AI-based product is the best way to address it. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p26"> 
   <p>If you can, ask yourself whether you are considering your customers’ needs, or you are simply trying to find a nail to hammer with AI. If the answer is that you’re putting AI before your customer needs, chances are that the project will not make it off the ground. If you are planning to use AI in response to a genuine customer need, then we can check off the first point on our list (see table 4.1 at the end of this section). This is an indicator that AI may be a good solution for you.</p>

   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"> Are hallucinations okay?</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p28"> 
   <p>In some applications, hallucinations aren’t a big deal. An example is the translation of hotel reviews on websites such as Booking.com or Tripadvisor, which are done by AI. Travelers prefer to see as many reviews as possible, even if some are incorrect, so hallucinations aren’t a big deal.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p29"> 
   <p>In other applications, hallucinations are not quite acceptable. We’ve covered many examples of that in this book already. Just in case, here’s another example explained in <em>The Economist </em><span class="CharOverride-2">(</span><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-3"><a href="https://mng.bz/lY5o">https://mng.bz/lY5o</a></span><span class="CharOverride-2">)</span>:</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p30"> 
   <blockquote>
    <div>
     McDonald’s, a fast-food chain, recently canned a trial that used AI to take customers’ drive-through orders after the system started making errors, such as adding $222-worth of chicken nuggets to one diner’s bill.
    </div>
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p31"> 
   <p>Before using AI, I recommend that you ask yourself whether hallucinations would be a big deal. Maybe they wouldn’t be as in the example of hotel reviews, so using AI would be just fine. In other cases, hallucinations might be a problem, as in the McDonalds story. In this case, you’ll have to decide whether using AI is such a good idea in the first place, as it might end up killing the product if customers find it unacceptable. Or, perhaps, you might be able to reformulate the task in a way that makes hallucinations more acceptable.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p32"> 
   <p>For example, suppose you’re building a tool to proofread legal contracts. If you frame it as a tool to “automatically correct contracts,” it may lead to much disappointment (and potentially disaster) for users when it sometimes hallucinates. If, however, you frame it as “run your contract through this tool to help you find mistakes that you may have overlooked,” then hallucinations might be okay, as users will now understand that it’s just a tool to double-check the contract and perhaps discover unnoticed mistakes.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p33"> 
   <p>This brings us to the end of our second item on the checklist. If hallucinations might cause major problems, you may want to look at other solutions. If hallucinations aren’t a big deal, or you can frame your AI solution so that they aren’t, then you can check another point off the list.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p34"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"> Do I need to explain how the output is generated?</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p35"> 
   <p>Companies love using machine learning to make predictions about all sorts of things, such as whether a client will buy a product or an industrial machine will need replacement soon. This is usually done by training a machine learning model on historical data. The richest and most complex types of models often yield the highest predictive performance. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p36"> 
   <p>But clients are sometimes very sensitive when it comes to understanding how predictions are generated. In some cases, this is because they don’t want to take a leap of faith and trust the model, even if a metric shows that it’s accurate. In other cases, they want to understand predictions to derive more insights from the model. For example, they may want to understand <em>why</em> a product is likely to be bought.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p37"> 
   <p>The more complex an ML model is, the more it turns into a black box and the harder it is to explain how its outputs are generated. So, the most accurate models are sometimes not appreciated much by clients who want to understand the outputs. This problem becomes even more pronounced when using deep learning models, including LLMs and CNNs, which contain many layers of processing and millions or billions of parameters.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p38"> 
   <p>So, before using AI, I recommend that you try to find out how much your client requires <em>explainability.</em> If explainability isn’t important, then using the most advanced AI models might be the best choice, and you can check this item off the list. However, if you need explainable outputs, you might have to use a simpler model, such as a linear one, even if its performance is worse. Or you may want to formulate the problem differently, such as conducting an analytical or statistical study instead of building a predictive model.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p39"> 
   <p>Alternatively, if you still want to use a complex model, you may want to try to use a technique to explain some aspects of how it works. There’s a whole field of study called <em>explainable AI</em> or just XAI. Many of these techniques, such as a popular one called SHAP (<a href="https://shap.readthedocs.io/">https://shap.readthedocs.io/</a>), work by identifying which inputs are the ones the model relies on the most to generate its output. While these techniques reveal aspects of how ML models work, they don’t provide a full explanation of how outputs are generated, so they might be underwhelming in some cases. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p40"> 
   <p>Researchers are now studying specific techniques to explain LLMs’ outputs. For example, they have developed methods to analyze attention scores inside transformers (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12874">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12874</a>). It’s still very early days though. We still have no solid understanding of how large ML models produce outputs.</p>

   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">Using conversational AI as an assistant</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p44"> 
   <p>In this section, we formulate three questions that can help you decide whether to use AI as an assistant to help you perform a task. We focus on conversational AI, meaning that you describe your task as a natural-language prompt. This includes using an LLM to help you code, or using a text-to-image app to create a logo.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p45"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"> Can I describe the task succinctly and validate the output easily?</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p46"> 
   <p>Conversational AI is most useful when you get “good bang for your prompt,” meaning that you obtain a useful output without having to go to great lengths to write a detailed, step-by-step prompt. So, before using it, I suggest you ask yourself:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p47">Can I describe the task succinctly?</li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p48">Can I validate the output easily?</li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p49"> 
   <p>For example, when writing code, there are tasks that can be described using very brief prompts such as</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p50">Summarize what the code in this file does.</li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p51">Write a function to download a file from an S3 bucket.</li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p52">Rewrite this function in JavaScript.</li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p53">Is there a way to optimize this code?</li> 
  </ul> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p54"> 
   <p>Other tasks are much more difficult to describe as they require a detailed, step-by-step specification of the solution. In these cases, writing the prompt might be as cumbersome as writing the code itself. For example, I once had to use a library called GraphHopper, which contains algorithms to find the shortest route between landmarks in a map, but I had to customize it to measure distances in a nonstandard way. For that, we had to use a custom formula we had designed together with the client. The requirements were so specific and custom, that I’m not sure I would have saved any time by writing a prompt and having an LLM write the code. So, if your answer to the question “Can I describe the task succinctly?” is yes, there are higher chances that AI will help you solve the problem (see table 4.2 at the end of this section). As AI hallucinates sometimes, it’s also important that you ask yourself the second question, “Can I validate the output easily?”, especially if you’re sensitive about the correctness of the output (see section 4.1.2).</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p55"> 
   <p>Some tasks can be validated easily. For example, if you already know how to perform the task, and all you want is to save time, you can rely on your expertise to quickly validate AI’s output. For example, I often forget how to use the Boto3 library to read files from S3. So, I often ask ChatGPT how to do it. Because I’ve already done it before and it just involves a couple of lines of code, I can easily look at ChatGPT’s code and verify that it’s correct. I can also quickly run the code to see if it fetches the required S3 file correctly. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p56"> 
   <p>To cite another example, if you ask an LLM whether a piece of code can be optimized, you can easily check whether its recommendations make sense to you, especially if you have coding experience and have studied things such as computational complexity. Or if you ask ChatGPT to rewrite a piece of code in another programming language, you can also verify the output if you’re familiar with the target language.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p57"> 
   <p>In other cases, validating AI’s output is not as quick or easy. For example, suppose you ask ChatGPT to write a SQL query that requires plenty of joins and business logic. Understanding the resulting query step by step may be cumbersome and take as much time as writing the query yourself. Or, if you ask ChatGPT to write code in a language you don’t know, you might have a hard time debugging it.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p58"> 
   <p>So, if your answer to the second question—“Can I validate the output easily?”—is also yes, then AI may provide good assistance.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p59"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"> Has anyone done it before?</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p60"> 
   <p>A software engineer commented on Twitter, “I sometimes wonder if coding is going to end up a bit like this” (<a href="https://mng.bz/BXr2">https://mng.bz/BXr2</a>), and shared a screenshot of the following code:</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p61"> 
   <div class="code-area-container"> 
    <pre class="code-area">import ai from 'ai-thing';
const Select = ai.gen`
  A select dropdown with these options:
  - Podcast
  - Book
  - Movie
Animate the dropdown to slide down from the top
of the page in a distracting manner.
`;</pre>  
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p62"> 
   <p>This would be really impressive if the only tools available for frontend development were plain JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. But that’s not how most people code nowadays. We use libraries and frameworks that help us do the job. For example, I often use Material UI for frontend development, which is a collection of ready-made and visually appealing components. This is how I would create the required animated dropdown using Material UI:</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p63"> 
   <div class="code-area-container"> 
    <pre class="code-area">import { Select, MenuItem } from '@mui/material';
const Select = 
&lt;Select&gt;
  &lt;MenuItem&gt;Podcast&lt;/MenuItem&gt;
  &lt;MenuItem&gt;Book&lt;/MenuItem&gt;
  &lt;MenuItem&gt;Movie&lt;/MenuItem&gt;
&lt;/Select&gt;</pre>  
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p64"> 
   <p>This code is almost exactly the same as the natural-language description from the previous code snippet. Although this code is written using a more structured language, it is as compact and easily readable. The gains from employing AI are minimal.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p65"> 
   <p>So, before using an AI assistant, I recommend you wonder if some other people may have done the job before, for example, by putting together a library that does what you need. If the task is very common—a select dropdown certainly is—it’s likely there’s a tool out there that does it for you. These tools are often very easy to use, mature, and well tested by an active community of developers. So, they help build software quickly and robustly. </p>

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p66"> 
   <p>A few weeks ago, I had to write code to calculate the position of the sun in the sky at a certain time and location. Instead of wrangling trigonometric equations or asking an AI assistant how to do it, my first instinct was to search for a library for the task. I thought, “This is such a cookie-cutter task that someone must have done it before.” I Googled “sun position calculation library python” and immediately found a library to do that specific job (and there are others, too). I installed it easily with just one command:</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p67"> 
   <div class="code-area-container"> 
    <pre class="code-area">pip install suncalc</pre>

  <div class="readable-text" id="p68"> 
   <p>The library is minimal, and its documentation is brief. You can quickly learn that it’s used as follows given a datetime, longitude, and latitude:</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p69"> 
   <div class="code-area-container"> 
    <pre class="code-area">from suncalc import get_position

   <p>A few days after I’d done this, out of curiosity, I asked GPT-4o, “Write a Python function to calculate the sun position given a location and time.” The chatbot wrote a complicated algorithm, with 40 lines of code. Here’s a snippet:</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p73"> 
   <div class="code-area-container"> 
    <pre class="code-area">n = julian_day - 2451545.0  # Days since J2000.0
        mean_longitude = (280.46 + 0.9856474 * n) % 360
        mean_anomaly = (357.528 + 0.9856003 * n) % 360
        ecliptic_longitude = (mean_longitude + 1.915 
           *math.sin(math.radians(mean_anomaly)) +
           0.020 * math.sin(math.radians(2 * mean_anomaly)))
        obliquity = 23.439 - 0.0000004 * n
        declination = (math.degrees(math.asin(math.sin(
           math.radians(obliquity)) * 
           math.sin(math.radians(ecliptic_longitude)))))</pre>  
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p74"> 
   <p><span class="CharOverride-4">The algorithm was difficult to follow and contained lots of unexplained constants. Luckily, the chatbot also suggested that, as an alternative, “We can use a Python library like Astral or Pysolar.” So, as a follow-up prompt, I asked, “How can I use the Astral library to do this instead?” It responded with a much shorter snippet of code, showing me how to use the library. However, I tried the code, and it didn’t run, as it hallucinated the correct way to use the said library. (You can find a record of the conversation at </span><a href="https://mng.bz/dXGw">https://mng.bz/dXGw</a><span class="CharOverride-4">.) </span></p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p75"> 
   <p>Perhaps running the prompt again or refining it would have yielded better results. My point, however, is that sometimes you’re better off by finding out whether someone has already built a tool for it. A quick Google search and scan of the documentation might be more effective than using AI, and the result may be more reliable. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p76"> 
   <p>So, try to ask yourself, especially if you’re performing a cookie-cutter task, whether someone else may have done it before. The most effective software developers avoid reinventing the wheel and try to build on other people’s proven work.</p>

   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"> What does an excellent job look like?</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p78"> 
   <p>One of my friends has a very interesting life story—he went from having little money and living in a hostel in exchange for a bed, to running a successful online business. A magazine wanted to share his story and asked him to write an article about it. He wrote it using ChatGPT.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p79"> 
   <p>He then shared the draft of the article with me and asked for my opinion. The grammar and style were pristine as expected. However, the article didn’t do justice to his story. For example, it went too fast over things readers would want to know more about. Notably, it didn’t say how he’d come up with his business idea while living in the hostel; instead, it jumped straight to how he’d started building the business. In addition, there were a few digressions, such as a personal opinion on a political matter, which distracted the reader from the main purpose of the article. The words were put together nicely, but the writing wasn’t good because it didn’t tell the story effectively. Had he submitted the story like that, in my opinion, it would have been acceptable but not the kind of thing that people read all the way through the end and recommend to others.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p80"> 
   <p>I gave my friend a list of comments about the article. My comments were mostly high level. For example, I advised him to slow down and tell the story in more detail sometimes, and I advised him to remove certain slow passages and digressions. I also advised him to reorganize some parts of the article that intertwined different topics. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p81"> 
   <p>When he read my comments, he said he’d finally understood why writing took me so much time. He also said he finally understood why I spent money on hiring human editors. Until then, he’d thought writing was mostly about grammar. He hadn’t realized how much the pacing and organization of an article could matter to make it compelling to the audience. I didn’t know that either when I started writing.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p82"> 
   <p>It’s very easy to jump to conclusions and think AI can perform a task well when we don’t know much about it. We may miss important things required to do the job well and unknowingly do subpar work.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p83"> 
   <p>So, before using AI, I recommend you investigate what it takes to do the intended job competently. Perhaps it involves many more things than is apparent at first sight. Afterward, once you understand the job better, you can decide whether AI will do a job good enough for what you need.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p84"> 
   <p>Consider the task of logo design. Some companies spend a fortune on hiring top-notch logo designers. But now that AI can create logos, is it worth hiring an expensive human logo designer? Well, it depends. If you speak with a high-end logo designer, you’ll discover that they perform thorough research about competitors’ logos and the sentiment they convey. Afterward, they design a logo that is truly original and not a rehash of previous logos—something AI isn’t great at—but at the same time somehow matches the style of competitors’ logos. This helps customers quickly get an idea of what the brand is about as they recognize the type of logo from competitors, while still giving your company’s logo a distinctive look.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p85"> 
   <p>Depending on your requirements, you may or may not need the thoroughness of high-end logo design. For example, if you’re launching a startup, all you may need is a logo to fill in the space on your website as it may be too early to spend money on a higher-end design. Once the company grows and starts having repeat customers, you may want to hire a specialist to design a logo that will better position your company in the competitive landscape. Before we move on to the next section, you’ll find a summary of questions and possible answers, plus their implications in table 4.2.</p>

   <h2 class=" readable-text-h2">Building LLM wrappers</h2> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p88"> 
   <p>As LLMs can tackle so many tasks, it is now tempting to build software products in a new way: Your code transforms the task into a natural-language prompt and makes an LLM do it. For example, if your app must show a list of nearby restaurants to the user based on their location, your code automatically crafts a prompt such as, “Create an HTML table listing the five restaurants closest to [the user coordinates are inserted here]. Each row should represent a restaurant, and the columns should be: The restaurant name, the cuisine style…” Afterward, your app uses an LLM to perform the task, and it parses the LLM’s output before displaying the restaurants to the user. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p89"> 
   <p>When coding this way, apps become sophisticated LLM wrappers—they manage the LLM, which is in charge of doing the heavy-duty work under the hood. I’ve met many early-stage startups that built or tried to build their initial products this way. They thought it wasn’t necessary to code the core functionality of their apps when you could just craft a prompt and have an LLM do the work instead.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p90"> 
   <p>Creating LLM wrappers may be a good way of building software in some cases. In other cases, however, it’s not the best solution. This section formulates one single question it may be worth asking yourself before you decide to build software that way. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p91"> 
   <h3 class=" readable-text-h3"> Will users interact with my product using natural language?</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p92"> 
   <p>I know a startup that was building a travel-planning app. The user would input travel details in a structured format by selecting the dates on a calendar and the destination from a list. The tool would then produce a structured sightseeing itinerary displayed in a timeline and a map. Note that this wasn’t a chatbot—the user didn’t converse with the app at any point by writing or reading free-form text.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p93"> 
   <p>Due to the popularization of LLMs, the company decided to build this feature using an LLM under the hood. The user’s request was first transformed into a natural-language prompt, such as, “Create a day-by-day itinerary to visit Paris from July 1<span class="_Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">st</span> to July 7<span class="_Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">th</span>…” The overall prompt was lengthy, as it contained instructions on how to output the itinerary in a specific format so it could be easily parsed and rendered in the app.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p94"> 
   <p>The startup struggled to make this work. One of the reasons was that the LLM’s output often included outdated information, such as a suggestion to visit an attraction that didn’t exist anymore or at a time during which it was closed. Moreover, the LLM’s output sometimes didn’t fully respect the required structure. For example, it would sometimes indicate an attraction’s street address where its web address should be. In addition, it all took over a minute to run, which is too long by today’s browsing standards.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p95"> 
   <p>The startup then realized that the problem it was trying to solve wasn’t related to natural language in any way—the user didn’t type in the inputs as free-form text (“I’d like to visit Paris”) and the outputs weren’t shown to the user as text either. So why use LLMs at all?</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p96"> 
   <p>The startup ended up solving the problem differently: after the user made a query, the software searched for relevant attractions in the required destination using the Google Places API, which provides up-to-date and structured information about attractions, such as opening hours and coordinates. Afterward, the software ran a pathfinding algorithm to create an ideal sightseeing itinerary from those attractions. The solution ran much faster and solved the problem better.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p97"> 
   <p>If users will interact with your product through natural language, using an LLM might be the best choice (see table 4.3 at the end of this section), as LLMs are specially designed to process and produce natural language. For example, if you’re building a customer-service chatbot, then using LLMs may be the best choice because they’re designed to process written, free-form requests and generate convincing prose. In this case, you exploit what LLMs are best at. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p98"> 
   <p>When users will not interact with your product using natural language, such as in the travel app, you may want to think twice before using an LLM to solve it. If you use an LLM, you may not enjoy its benefits, and you’ll have to cope with its drawbacks, such as long execution time, hallucinations, and unstructured outputs. In those cases, old-school software, such as a database look up, may do a better job. So, if your task does not involve natural language, analyze first whether other tools could be more suitable for the job before building an LLM wrapper. </p>

   <p>This brings us to the end of the chapter. We’ve covered a few scenarios of when to use AI. I hope it will prove useful the next time you’re working on a problem and wondering whether it’s worthwhile to bring in an AI model. </p>

  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p102">Adopt an entrepreneurship mindset: ensure you understand the customer’s problem and find the best way to solve it, which may or may not be AI. Try not to decide you’ll use AI before knowing what you’ll use it for.</li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p103">Evaluate whether hallucinations are OK for your users. In some cases, such as the translation of hotel reviews, users are not too fussy about them. If hallucinations are a deal breaker, you may need to rethink the task.</li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p104">If your client wants to understand how AI generates its outputs, you may find yourself in quite a pickle, as the most powerful AI cannot be understood in detail. You might need to use a less performant but more explainable model or a technique to try to explain some aspects of the model such as the finding the relative importance of input features.</li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p105">If you use AI as an assistant, you can quickly ask yourself, “Can I easily describe the task and validate the output?” If so, you get good bang for your prompt, which is when AI is most effective. If you can’t describe the task succinctly or it takes a lot of effort to validate the output, using AI may not be very useful.</li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p106">When using AI as an assistant, make sure you’re not trying to reinvent the wheel. If you’re performing a common task, perhaps there’s a well-documented and proven way of doing the job. For example, when coding a certain task, an open source software may already exist that will do exactly what you need, and it might be easier and more reliable to use it instead of trying to do the same using an AI assistant.</li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p107">Before having AI do a certain job, try to understand what doing that job in an excellent way entails. It might be more complicated than it seems. You can then decide whether an AI assistant will help you do the job to a satisfactory level, depending on your needs.</li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p108">Some people are building apps that are LLM wrappers—the job is done by an LLM under the hood, which is managed by the app. This is most powerful when you’re dealing with a natural-language problem, either because the user inputs free-form text or the system must generate human-readable text. If your problem doesn’t involve natural language, maybe using old-school algorithms instead of building LLM wrappers will be a better choice.</li>
