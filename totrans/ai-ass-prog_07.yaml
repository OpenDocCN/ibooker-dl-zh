    language models that can whip up code. Sure, they might not have all the bells
    and whistles like those that specialize in coding—such as with integration with
    IDEs, sophisticated security, or guardrails for the types of code used to train
    the models—but they’re still impressive. Plus, they’re not just about coding;
    they’re also great for planning and brainstorming.

    on November 30, 2022\. OpenAI, the brains behind the app, didn’t really splash
    out on marketing. Turns out, they didn’t have to. ChatGPT quickly blew up and
    went viral all on its own.

    [revenues had shot up to $1.2 billion](https://oreil.ly/Xlv3B), a massive leap
    from a mere $28 million in 2022\. But it wasn’t all about ChatGPT itself. There
    was also a booming business with OpenAI’s API.

    big names from Silicon Valley backing it, like Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman,
    Ilya Sutskever, John Schulman, and Wojciech Zaremba. They were ready to pitch
    in up to a cool $1 billion to get things rolling.

    mostly with PhDs in data science and AI. The mission was to achieve artificial
    general intelligence (AGI), the technology that can outdo humans in most tasks
    that matter. The goal had an altruistic component: to use AGI for the greater
    good and steer clear of any uses that might hurt people or give too much power
    to the few.'

    others. The organization made its patents and code public, working hand in hand
    with other institutions. But the cost of creating cutting-edge generative AI systems
    was steep.

- en: To keep its big dreams alive and bring in the right people, OpenAI created a
    “capped” for-profit company in 2019\. This meant they could now legally get cash
    from venture funds and strategic investors, as well as give their employees a
    slice of the pie. That same year, Microsoft came in with a $1 billion investment.
    A few more rounds of investment brought in a total of about $3 billion from Microsoft.
    Fast-forward to April 2023, and the tech giant went all in, dropping a whopping
    $10 billion into the mix.

- en: OpenAI’s GPT-4 model exhibits remarkable versatility in code generation, owing
    to its diverse training data encompassing a broad spectrum of sources. This extensive
    training has enabled human-level performance on several professional and academic
    benchmarks, and GPT-4 has consistently outperformed GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 in most
    programming languages. This is largely due to its enhanced ability to follow complex
    instructions expressed in natural language and generate technical or creative
    works with greater depth. Another key factor is the 32K context window.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interestingly, when evaluated on specific code generation benchmarks, an enhanced
    version of GPT-4 integrated with Reflexion—a framework for creating sophisticated
    agents based on LLMs—rocked an impressive [88% pass rate on HumanEval](https://oreil.ly/DFaDj).
    This score was notably higher than that of the base version of GPT-4, which had
    a 67% pass rate. This suggests that, with certain improvements, GPT-4 can attain
    state-of-the-art performance in code generation tasks.

    [GPT-4 scored a rating of 392 points](https://oreil.ly/icUjw), an improvement
    over GPT-3.5’s 260 points. However, GPT-4 is still a newbie in the world of competitive
    programming, and these scores are in the bottom 5%. Even though GPT-4 has come
    a long way, it still has a lot of catching up to do to match human skills in tough
    coding challenges.

    up processes, or running actions. They’re written in YAML syntax and kick into
    gear when certain actions happen, like pushing code, making a new issue, or scheduling
    times. With GitHub Actions, developers can build, test, and deploy their code
    straight from GitHub, making their software development process smoother and more

    entirely cloud based makes it great for teaming up with others, and it’s a solid
    pick for web apps and group projects.

    to understand the relationships among the data, formulas, and scripts. Knowing
    how they dance together helps you build models that are powerful and don’t trip
    up on errors. After all, if you tweak something in your data, the change can ripple
    through your formulas and mess with what your scripts output, and before you know
    it, your final results have done a total 180.

    Gemini, and Claude. We checked out their cool features—stuff like code generation,
    plugins, surfing the web in real time, and handling big chunks of information.
    Sure, they might not be on par with specialized coding tools, but they still have
    a lot to offer when you want to speed up your software development. And as these
    LLMs keep getting better, they’re gearing up to bring even more awesome AI-powered
    programming breakthroughs.
