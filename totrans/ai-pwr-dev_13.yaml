- en: In this appendix, we will get set up with ChatGPT. You interact with ChatGPT
    on a website, so there isn’t any software to install and configure. However, you
    do need an account to get started. So, we will walk through setting up an account
    and entering an initial prompt.

    to upgrade to a “professional” license, called ChatGPT Plus. This license gives
    you priority access during peak load times. Given that ChatGPT gets 13 million
    users per day, upgrading is almost required if you need to use ChatGPT during
    the day, despite ChatGPT being blissfully unaware of this fact.
