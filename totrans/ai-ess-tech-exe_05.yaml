    the challenges, strengths, and guiding policy for your AI initiatives. With that
    strategy in hand, the next step is being able to communicate it effectively.

    will take for the next 6 to 12 months. These actions should be clear, specific,
    and measurable, and should align with your long-term vision and strategy. They
    might be things you will do more of, or less of, or things you will stop doing
    altogether. No matter what, they should be aligned with your long-term vision
    and strategy.

    excellent basis for communicating strategy to internal teams, stakeholders, and

    AI will affect their roles, or to investors how AI will drive growth and profitability,
    or to customers how AI will enhance their experience with your product.
