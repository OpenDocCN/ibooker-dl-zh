    came out in 1994, and we’re writing this book in 2025! In this chapter, we’ll
    tell you what we mean by equating generative AI (GenAI) to a “Netscape moment,”
    and then we’ll lightly touch on a wide range of topics, from how the technology
    works to things to keep in mind as you plan your GenAI journey.

    a different route. We figure that if we give you enough things to think about,
    give you enough value, and teach you the things that sit in our brains that we

    what we’re doing here—it’s like a Netflix pilot episode: it’s a little longer
    than the episodes that follow, but the remaining episodes shorten up and narrow
    the focus to the topic at hand. We also did this so you don’t have to read the
    book linearly. For example, we might touch on how there are over a million large
    language models (LLMs) out there, which makes us confident in telling you that
    one model (no matter how popular it is or how much press it gets) *will not* rule
    them all. Not by a long shot. You might have a lot of enterprise data that you
    want to drive into your AI but not share, and that might spur you to jump to [Chapter 8](ch08.html#ch08_using_your_data_as_a_differentiator_1740182052172518)
    to learn about the LLM landscape and how to safely use your data with an AI model.
    Or perhaps you’ve decided that you’ll learn from our experience when we tell you
    that firms that build a company-wide upskilling plan will outperform those that
    leave the upskilling to some propeller heads and the privileged few with access
    to the AI. In that case, you’ll jump to [Chapter 6](ch06.html#ch06_skills_that_thrill_1740182050334297)

    relic of the internet that’s as familiar to our youth today as rotary phones.
    Young readers...it was pretty much the world’s first web browser.) Think about
    what happened (assuming you were around) when Netscape made its debut in 1994:
    the internet started to become very tangible and very personable—for everyone.
    Truly, the internet was taken out of the hands of just the privileged few and
    democratized for the many (though not all took advantage of it at first). Looking
    back, it’s evident that a democratized internet changed our world...forever. It
    changed the way we store data, communicate, buy, date, and even vote! So, we call
    this a Netscape moment (and they don’t come around that often) because at this
    point, the world has gotten a strong sense of what the AI opportunity is, and
    that’s going to lead to a heck of a lot of innovation and ideas going forward.
    But much like those who didn’t take advantage of the original Netscape moment,
    those who don’t become part of this wave of AI will fall behind and be on the
    wrong side of the divide. This divide will not only impact their ability to stay
    connected with evolving societal norms and practices, but those on the wrong side
    will be restricted in their access to essential services and opportunities. This
    Netscape moment is going to play out just like the first one did. Those who have
    access to AI and take advantage of it will reshape the future (just think what
    those who took advantage of their access to the internet and put it to work did
    to the taxi industry), and those who don’t take advantage of it will lose out,
    with hefty societal or business consequences. (The names of the original Netscape
    moment losers have been withheld to protect the guilty.)'

    note that we humans have a history of creating things that we’ve struggled to

    time (for example, nuclear technology, with which we’ve created medicine, power,
    and bombs). We talk about this in [Chapter 5](ch05.html#ch05_live_die_buy_or_try_much_will_be_decided_by_ai_1740182048942635).

    And just how does it connect data points? It does it by using math and science.
    The simplest way to explain it is to say that AI is just trying to guess a number
    that represents something (which we call a *vector*) by using clues given to it
    from previous numbers (which we call *vector sequences*). Yes, that’s right. If
    you’re using AI for visual recognition, it’s likely looking at a set of numbers—typically,
    three groups of them, representing red, green, and blue (RGB)—with shading intensities
    on a scale of 0 to 255\. If you have a 16-MHz voice recording, it means you have
    16,000 numbers per second that represent different components of sound (like displacement
    and amplitude). If you type the sentence, “Don’t cry over spilled milk,” into
    an AI, it reads it as something like {16357, 956, 16106, 927, 74125, 14403} and
    really has no idea what milk is, let alone why you would cry over spilling it.
    In fact, it’d be more accurate to call an LLM—which powers many GenAI programs
    like ChatGPT and DeepSeek—a large number-guessing model. Perhaps better yet, you
    could call it a large sequence number model (which is what computer nerds...er,
    scientists, call them).'

    so big? To many, it’s the amazing things that AI can now do. Certainly, we’ve
    seen it do amazing things, but we’ve been around AI—and technology, for that matter—for
    a while. Amazing stuff happens a lot. Look at that TV hanging on your wall. Is
    it thinner than the one you had three years ago and the one you had five years
    before that? What about the number of cameras on your smart phone—more or fewer?
    And what about the amount of storage on your computer, the number of streaming
    services you have, and the check-in experience for your flight? We *expect* technology
    to get better all the time, and certainly, if you look at successive generations
    of any LLM or non-AI technology, stuff gets more and more amazing over time. But
    one thing not to be missed in this Netscape moment is the set of superpowers brought
    to us by prompts. A *prompt* is what we give to an LLM, and a *completion* is
    what the LLM returns. The prompt has literally given non-techies superpowers.
    How so? In the past, you had a shot at giving yourself a productivity boost, *but
    only if* you were code and data savvy—but today, all of uscan interact with AI
    in the same natural way we do with our human colleagues.

    in your organization? A few years ago, two of us wrote a book called *The AI Ladder*
    (O’Reilly), in which we introduced the framework you see in [Figure 1-2](#ch01_figure_4_1740182043962382).
    That book focused on data as the path to AI through an information architecture
    (IA). We think this point of view accurately reflected how AI was done at the
    time—humans collecting, organizing, and labeling datasets for supervised training.
    (Things changed with the invention of the *transformer*, which to many was the
    inception of GenAI.) We felt that the AI Ladder was a perfect analogy because
    it wasn’t just about technology—it also embodied the vendors you chose to work
    with and the skills gaps you were trying to bridge in your companies.

    ladder, you will certainly climb it higher, faster, and with even more confidence.
    None of that goes away with GenAI and agents, and that’s why we decided to reboot

    smaller phased components get you quicker wins and more focus—once you finish
    Phase 1 of the use case (save money), go to Phase 2 (make money). For example,
    we talked to a company that moves 30 million pounds of potatoes across a value
    chain, trying to stay relevant in a world of automated systems. When they came
    to us, about 50% of their facility was high tech and about 50% was low tech. They
    had a challenging issue because a potato wart infestation devastated the exportability
    of some of their yields. Potato warts pose no threat to human health or food safety,
    but they do have an economic impact on potato growers because they make the product
    unmarketable in the grading process (and even banned in certain countries). The
    movement to invest in technology to identify and better wash “warty” potatoes
    (just writing it that way makes them sound way worse than they are) would allow
    this company to better process its potatoes. That movement resulted in big savings
    over its original plan to expand (scarce) labor for more manual inspections and
    washing. Using budget from a spend money to save money (labor) savings approach
    created surplus budget to deploy those dollars (by using renovation to fund innovation)
    into reestablishing export relationships for some potatoes (with the veracity
    of the AI-assisted inspection and washing process) and finding secondary markets
    for other potatoes. This also had the benefit of reducing the amount of food waste

    compliance with the least possible work-to-comply approach. Their measured objectives

    approach misses the opportunity to create regulatory dividends from those compliance
    investments (data intelligence for better explaining your LLM’s output to an auditor,
    for example) to accelerate your AI strategy. We’ve seen *way* too many data governance
    projects that end up shortchanging the real value to the business, and in a GenAI

    increases. That’s partly because you are doing things “differently” (you’re AI+

    and you’re now modernizing your processes. As the world exited the isolation (COVID)

    value curve in their favor and those that stayed on the lower overall yield side
    of it and are still there today. For example, one United States‒based craft store

    stores, while to this day, a very well-known large retailer is still trying to

    agree that any game that has a position called a Silly Mid must be cool and a

    runs (the “long ball”). There’s no question that home runs are super exciting
    and the makeup of sporting news highlight reels, but there’s no proof that focusing
    on hitting more home runs results in more wins. But if you get a runner on base
    by hitting a single, you always have the potential to score. At the end of the
    day, home runs are fun and flashy, but without pitching, good defense, and the
    ability to “grind out” runs, home runs are “empty calories.” When it comes to
    AI, if you’re just getting started, this is your first project, and you’re in

    lines of code—and to put that into perspective, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner runs on
    just 14 million lines of code. (We know, it shocked us too.) It’s obvious that
    a physical car defect requires a recall, but software code defects are super costly—especially
    in the auto industry. Car manufacturers must get the bugs fixed (patched), which
    typically requires bringing a customer into a service shop for something that
    they likely have no idea is even wrong with their car. Sure, over-the-air (OTA)
    patching is an option, but now you have to deal with a greatly expanded surface

    take 20 minutes of clicking to transfer an employee to another department! Not
    surprisingly, they come with high failure rates. We no longer walk by this problem
    at IBM. Our chief human resources officer (CHRO), Nickel LaMoreaux, personally
    skilled up on the very things we are covering in this book and drove a plan to
    shift this left. Today, employee transfer failure rates are pretty much nil, and
    over 4,000 hours have been returned to the business in the form of “think time.”
    We’d be remiss if we didn’t again remind you how this is a great example of the
    best way to start your modern AI journey: by spending money to save money on internal
    automation use cases. What’s more, her team gained skills and confidence on this
    rollout, and that has led to literally dozens of other innovations, with staggering
    time-saved metrics and dollars saved across the IBM business. (In aggregate, across
    all functions, actions like these have saved IBM $3 billion since inception.)'

    money to make money (that is, doing the transformational stuff in [Figure 1-4](#ch01_figure_7_1740182043962447)).

    pioneering work in the field of photography. While Kodak was a story of success
    (it was once one of the most successful companies in the world), it is also one
    of spectacular failure. What happened? Kodak thought it was in the film business
    and got myopic when trying to protect it; after all, it was Kodak that invented
    the digital camera back in 1975\. But as we now know today, Kodak was really in
    the memory-making business, and when the modality of memories shifted right, the
    memory-making business went digital. (Sometimes, shifting right is your strategy,
    and sometimes, technology changes and you have no choice but to shift right with
    it.) This shift right transformed an entire industry and created new business
    models. Pictures could not only be shared more easily, but you could take more
    of them without paying to print bad photos. You got to choose the pictures you
    wanted to keep instead of waiting three days only to find that your brother Doug
    ruined the family photo with bunny rabbit fingers behind Grandma’s head, while
    cousin Jimmy on the right was flying low. You could also store more pictures in
    less space because your laptop could hold files with pictures that would take
    up about 85 feet of shelf space in printed form.^([2](ch01.html#id368)) Companies
    used technology to shift photography to the right. Amateurs became professionals
    with software editing tools, frictionless photo printing, ways to organize and
    retrieve photos, and tag people’s faces in photos...and you know how the story
    went for Kodak.

    also realized something much bigger—they weren’t in the car navigation business;
    they were in the tracking and mapping business. Garmin shifted right to bring
    new services to marine and hiking activities, among others. They changed the way
    amateur golf is played with not just a map of a course but with all kinds of in-game
    features and course statistics. Communities sprouted up around area mapping and
    recommendations—sharing suggestions for runs or hikes, enhancing experiences and
    accuracy via crowdsourced corrections, and more. Now, think about how GenAI and

    in an adversarial manner, isn’t it? You talk to your agent to get a policy underwritten,
    you have no claims. You talk to your agent next year, and your rates go up. Or,
    you get into some kind of accident, make a claim, and your rates go up then. Either
    way, it certainly never feels like any sort of partnership.

    to comply with work safety regulations because it doesn’t want its employees to

    people to get hurt in the first place either.

- en: GenAI and agents can come together to completely change the insurance relationship
    by shifting right the way risk is underwritten on a construction site. Consider
    using AI to monitor a jobsite for proper gowning (identifying worker code‒required
    safety helmets, jackets, gloves, proximity to electrified equipment, and so on).
    In this use case, cameras are set up in different safety zones that use AI models
    to flag worker safety compliance with per-zone requirements. You can place one
    camera in a zone where the risk is related to welding and fire, while you can
    place another where a crane operator is lifting steel beams for storage. AI vision
    can track compliant and out-of-compliance events, and agentic workflows can stitch
    together the video, flag the compliance issues with red boxes, and generate a
    summary report (hourly, daily, weekly...you name it). To continue the example,
    say an accident occurs and the risk can be subsequently underwritten with a higher
    premium for that single zone (but not the entire site) the very next day. In that
    case, the site operator will have a chance to reduce that risk premium by complying
    with recommendations from AI-generated reports that update the underwriter using
    AI-infused real-time processing on the edge. There are numerous ways to make this
    scenario play out (per-zone compliance, site compliance, per-day pricing, monthly
    pricing, and so on), but it’s a definite shift right to a new business model and
    a new relationship model.
