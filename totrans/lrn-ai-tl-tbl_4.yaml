    basic and advanced metric definitions. Now it’s time to see how they’re consumed
    from your audience’s perspective. In this chapter, you’ll see how metrics you
    create are displayed to end users, what happens when they follow multiple metrics,
    and how they can receive summarized digests of the AI insights generated.

    after navigating to Tableau Pulse from Tableau Cloud, end users are greeted with
    a summary page that shows the metrics they already follow and those that are available
    for following. However, instead of being able to see all metrics in Pulse, remember
    they will have access to only those tied to published data sources that they have
    View and Connect permissions for. [Figure 4-1](#ch04_figure_1_1732595608457515)

    published data source used in previous examples, Superstore Transactions.
