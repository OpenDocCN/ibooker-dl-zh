<h1>Foreword</h1>

<p>I’ve spent a lot of time helping developers learn how to use AI tools as part of their daily work—by mentoring people, running training sessions, and writing about them in books—and I’ve relied on those same tools myself while building real software. One really stands out to me: GitHub Copilot.</p>

<p>It’s a game-changer. I use it all the time.</p>

<p>I’ve been coding for decades, and like every developer, sometimes I get stuck. Maybe it’s when I’m using a new technology or API, and I’m dreading going through poorly written documentation. Maybe it’s when I’m refactoring a particularly nasty bit of code that everyone on my team has been avoiding. Or maybe I just don’t feel like writing dull boilerplate code that has to get written but is going to cost me a half hour of my life that I’ll never get back.</p>

<p>That’s where Copilot can really make a difference. It might give me all the code I need, complete and working. Or it might give me just a starting point—something we’ll iterate on together. Either way, it’s valuable to me, and it almost always gives me enough to get things moving again.</p>

<p>But working with Copilot isn’t a one-way street—it comes with responsibility. Copilot can write code that compiles, runs, even passes tests. But if you don’t understand what it gave you, or why it works—or, most importantly, how you got it to produce that result—you’re not really in control of what’s going into your codebase. This book puts you in control.</p>

<p>Good developers need to do more than just learn Copilot’s features. We need to learn an effective way to work with AI, one that supports us in what we already do: write code, make decisions, and solve problems alongside other people.</p>

<p>That learning starts with understanding that Copilot isn’t perfect—and it isn’t trying to be perfect. It’s trying to help you move forward by offering suggestions based on the patterns and context in your code. And a lot of the time, it gets satisfyingly close. But like any tool, it works best when you know how to guide it—and when to slow down and double-check what it gave you.</p>

<p>And that’s why this book matters. <em>Learning GitHub Copilot</em> is practical, thoughtful, and grounded in how developers work on code every day. Brent Laster has done a masterful job because he doesn’t just list off Copilot’s features; he shows you how to use them when you’re doing real work—when things are messy, nonlinear, and often under a deadline.</p>

<p>He starts with Copilot’s built-in strengths, like explaining code and writing tests, and then moves into showing you how it helps with things that trip people up—SQL queries, regular expressions, YAML files, and all the other small (and sometimes not so small!) tasks that eat up time. I appreciate all the examples throughout the book because they reflect the kinds of problems developers face in real life. I think you’ll appreciate them too.</p>

<p>Copilot works as an important everyday development tool—not because it promises magic, but because it respects how developers think. This book does the same thing. It assumes you’re thoughtful, capable, and still learning, and it gives you space to make good decisions with the tool instead of just following along.</p>

<p>In my own teaching and writing, I’ve seen how quickly developers improve when they get clear, honest guidance—especially when it helps them make better decisions when they’re doing real work. That’s exactly what this book provides. It’s not hype. It’s not oversimplified. It’s a practical guide to a powerful tool, written for developers who want to stay in control of their code.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Copilot, this book is a great place to start. If you’ve been using it for a while, you’ll pick up techniques that make it more effective and easier to trust. And if you’ve been skeptical, that’s healthy. This book meets you where you are, and it’ll show you how to get the most out of the tool without giving up what makes you a good developer.</p>
