    I immediately go to the “Getting Started” section. As I need more details, I consult
    the documentation. This chapter was born with the same idea: to see how things
    work immediately. We’ll look at a rough but complete sketch of what you’ll learn
    in the book. In this chapter, we will look at the basic concepts behind Altair,
    and then we will implement a practical use case, which will allow us to transform
    a raw dataset into a story. We will progressively apply the data, information,
    knowledge, wisdom (DIKW) pyramid principles in Altair and see the results achieved
    step by step. In the second part of the chapter, we will use Copilot to automate
    some steps of the story creation process. We will focus only on Copilot as a generative
    AI tool to keep the chapter simple and the flow understandable. In the following
    chapters, we will introduce ChatGPT and DALL-E to the DIKW pyramid.'

    for statistical visualization based on the Vega and Vega-Lite visualization grammars.
    Vega is a visualization grammar for creating expressive and interactive data visualizations.
    Vega-Lite is a high-level declarative language built on top of Vega, designed
    to simplify the creation of common data visualizations with concise and intuitive
    syntax. We will discuss Vega and Vega-Lite in the next chapter.

- en: Altair is a declarative library, meaning you can describe the intended chart
    outcome rather than needing to manually program every step, defining a concise
    and intuitive syntax for creating interactive visualizations. We use declarative
    libraries to specify what we want to see in a chart. We can specify the data and
    the type of visualization we want, and the library creates the visualization for
    us automatically. Declarative libraries stand in contrast to imperative libraries,
    which instead focus on building a visualization manually (e.g., specifying the
    desired axis, size, legend, and labels). Matplotlib is an example of an imperative
    library.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Encodings specify the mapping between the DataFrame columns and their visual
    representation in the Altair chart. In practice, encodings define where to represent
    data in the chart, such as their position, size, and color. In practice, encodings
    define how data attributes are mapped to visual properties in a chart. For example,
    you can encode a dataset’s *x* values as positions on the *x*-axis and *y* values
    as positions on the y-axis. A *channel* in Altair refers to a visual property,
    like `x`, `y`, `color`, `size`, and `shape`, which can be used to represent data
    attributes in a chart.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each channel is associated with a data type, which describes the type of data
    an attribute contains, such as *quantitative* for numerical data, *ordinal* for
    ordered categorical data, or *nominal* for categorical data with no inherent order.
    For example, in the following listing, we use encodings to specify which columns
    of the DataFrame we must use in the x- and y-axes.

- en: Note  First, create a new DataFrame with the required values. Then, draw the
    chart. Use `title` to modify the title of the y-axis. Use the `scale` property
    to select the range of colors. In your case, you used a default scheme (`set2`).
    For the complete list of schemes, you can refer to the D3 documentation ([https://observablehq.com/@d3/color-schemes](https://observablehq.com/@d3/color-schemes)).
    The chart also uses the `strokeWidth` channel, which enables us to configure the
    stroke width of each line. We use a conditional statement to set the stroke width.
    To access a column value directly within a conditional statement, use `alt.datum.<column>`.
    To set the value to a specific string or number, use `alt.value()`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To encode the`x` channel, you used the `alt.X()` object—rather than a simple
    string, like we did before—the same as you did for the `y` and `color` channels.
    When you want to specify the channel details, you can use the channel object instead
    of a simple string. For example, you can use `alt.Y()` for the`y` channel, `alt.Color()`
    for the `color` channel, and so on. Within a channel object, you can set different
    properties that depend on the channel. For example, for the `x` and `y` channels,
    you can set the axis property. You can define a value or an additional object
    for each property within a channel. In practice, the same strategy of channels
    applies to the channel properties. For example, `axis` is a property of the `x`
    and `y` channels. You can use `alt.Axis()` to set additional properties of the
    axis. In the example, you have set the `legend` property of the `color` channel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the chart’s general properties, such as the title. Figure 2.9 shows the resulting
