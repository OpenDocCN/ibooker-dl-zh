<p>Another costly mistake that executives make is incorrectly hiring an
AI team. This mistake can lead to wasted resources, team churn, and
delayed AI efforts.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="The AI Specialist Trap"><div class="sect1" id="id94">
<h1>The AI Specialist Trap</h1>
<p>Many executives rush to hire data scientists or machine learning
engineers  (MLEs) right away. While these roles are crucial, bringing them on
too early is a classic “foot gun” scenario. Here’s why:</p>
<p>Data scientists and MLEs need data to work with. If you’re still in
product discovery, there’s often little for them to do.</p>
<p>The people who fulfill these roles likely aren’t equipped to build
full-stack products from scratch. Lacking a clear product direction,
they may inadvertently steer you off course.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="A Smarter Hiring Progression"><div class="sect1" id="id95">
<h1>A Smarter Hiring Progression</h1>
<p>Instead of immediately seeking AI specialists, follow this general
progression when building an AI product:</p>
<dl>
<dt>1. Focus on building the product</dt><dd>Start by hiring
Application Developers who can help iterate on the product concept
quickly. At this stage, you’re still figuring out what your product is,
and need to build a thesis.</dd>
<dt>2. Build the data foundations</dt><dd>Instrument your system
to collect the right data and set up proper observability. This may
require Platform or Data Engineers, depending on the type and scale of
data you’re working with.</dd>
<dt>3. Optimize your AI system</dt><dd>Once you have a working
product and data, that’s when you should hire MLEs or data scientists to
optimize the system. At this point, they should be able to design
metrics, build evaluation systems, run experiments, and debug stochastic
systems.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The key is to maintain a strong domain expert presence throughout
each stage.</p>
<p>Another great option is to bring in advisors instead of hiring
full-time specialists. Bringing in outside help can help you accomplish
the three-step progression above while avoiding the commitment of a
full-time hire.</p>

<h1>Hiring the Right Way</h1>
<p>When you do reach the stage of hiring AI specialists, be
strategic.</p>
<p>Test for data literacy by giving candidates messy datasets to work
with. This crucial skill helps in designing effective metrics and
evaluations. For a deeper dive, read Jason Liu’s blog post <a href="https://oreil.ly/WRzNQ">“10 Ways to Be Data Illiterate (And How to Avoid Them)”</a>.</p>
<p>When the time comes to hire MLEs, Eugene Yan has a great <a href="https://oreil.ly/iq7qN">guide on
interviewing</a>.</p>
<p>Remember, the goal is to build a team—and the best way to do this is
by hiring the right talent at the right time.</p>
