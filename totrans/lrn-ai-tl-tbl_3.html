<h1><span class="label">Chapter 3. </span>Advanced Tableau Pulse Features</h1>

<p>Now that you know how to enable Tableau Pulse and construct basic metrics, it’s time to dig into the more advanced features that are available. These advanced features allow you, the metric author, to create more robust metrics using definition filters, make adjustments to the time dimension, and construct an advanced metric definition with calculated fields or custom filtering. You’ll also learn how permissions for metrics work and how to manage them.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Definition Filters" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch03_definition_filters_1732595608107652">
<h1>Definition Filters</h1>

<p>In the preceding chapter, I briefly described a definition filter. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="definition filters" data-secondary="defined" data-type="indexterm" id="id432"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="definition filters" data-tertiary="defined" data-type="indexterm" id="id433"/>A <em>definition filter</em> is a preset form of data filtering that limits what records are included in a metric definition. That means for each subsequent metric created from a metric definition, the scope and inclusion of data that is used for the metrics are always filtered in the same way. This behavior is distinctly different from the adjustable metric filters, as they are not visible or accessible (adjustable) to the end user.</p>

<p>A good use case <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="definition filters" data-secondary="use case for" data-type="indexterm" id="id434"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="definition filters" data-tertiary="use case for" data-type="indexterm" id="id435"/>for a definition filter may be when you cannot change or introduce filters in the published data source used for the subsequent metrics. This could be because it is not your responsibility to manage, create, or maintain the published data source. It could also simply mean that introducing those filters for the entire published data source would overly limit and reduce the scope of analysis available. Regardless of the reason, definition filters are the in-between filtering you’ll want to use for metric definitions when each downstream metric relies on the same filtered data.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Application of Definition Filters" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch03_applying_definition_filters_1732595608107713">
<h2>Application of Definition Filters</h2>

<p>A <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="definition filters" data-secondary="applying" data-type="indexterm" id="kab024"/>definition <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="definition filters" data-tertiary="applying" data-type="indexterm" id="kab025"/>filter is applied in the same metric definition menu you’ve seen before. Beneath the measure you select for the metric definition, you’ll see a button to add a definition filter. Only text-based (string) fields are available for selection from the dropdown. Let’s go through an example with the same published data source used in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_getting_started_with_tableau_pulse_1732595607647464">Chapter 2</a> (refer to <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_figure_8_1732595607634683">Figure 2-8</a> for Superstore Transactions).</p>

<p>This time, you’ll construct a metric called US Orders, which will be the distinct count of order IDs associated with orders shipped to the US. The data set includes a field called Country/Region that has two values: United States and Canada. You’ll be setting the definition filter to United States. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_1_1732595608093614">Figure 3-1</a> shows the metric configuration and highlights the location of the Add Definition Filter button.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 3-1. </span>The metric definition for US Orders</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Clicking Add Definition Filter opens a dropdown where you can select the appropriate field, Country/Region. A window will appear where you can set the behavior of the filter. The filter can be set to include or exclude values in a multiselect format, and there is also a search function for fields with many values. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_2_1732595608093646">Figure 3-2</a> shows the options for the field.</p>

<figure><div class="figure" id="ch03_figure_2_1732595608093646"><img src="assets/lait_0302.png"/>
<h6><span class="label">Figure 3-2. </span>The definition filter for Country/Region</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>As you would expect, all the data in the metric definition is now for only the US. From here, if you wanted to, you could apply another definition filter. When you do this, you’ll notice that the Country/Region option is no longer available to select. That’s because each field’s filtering behavior can be configured only once (later in the chapter you’ll see how to work around this). Additionally, these filters are immediately applied and considered for any subsequent definition filtering. For example, after selecting United States, applying a filter for State/Province includes only names of US states.</p>

<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>
<p>A best practice for applying filters is to start from the broadest filter, the filter that will reduce the most rows from your data, and continue down to the narrowest filter. Throughout the Tableau platform, filters are typically shown in a vertical list format, so maintaining this approach allows for easy debugging if you end up over-filtering your data or are trying to ensure that only relevant data is included in your analysis.</p>
</div>

<p>The great news is that the application of this definition filter applies to all child metrics based off this metric definition. This saves a lot of work and ensures consistency across <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="definition filters" data-startref="kab025" data-tertiary="applying" data-type="indexterm" id="id436"/>the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="definition filters" data-secondary="applying" data-startref="kab024" data-type="indexterm" id="id437"/>metrics.</p>

<h2>Relationship to Adjustable Metric Filters</h2>

<p>Although <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="definition filters" data-secondary="adjustable metric filters and" data-type="indexterm" id="id438"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="adjustable metric filters" data-type="indexterm" id="id439"/>definition filters work behind the scenes, that doesn’t mean the fields used within those filters can’t also be used as adjustable metric filters for end users. Remember, an adjustable metric filter is an interactive filter that end users can access to filter and limit data shown in the metric. The distinction here is that only those values that are included in the definition filter are listed in the subsequent adjustable metric filters. So, if, for example, you include an adjustable filter for Country/Region for the metric definition, as in the previous example, your end user will see only United States as an option for interactive filtering.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="The Time Dimension" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch03_the_time_dimension_1732595608107835">
<h1>The Time Dimension</h1>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_getting_started_with_tableau_pulse_1732595607647464">Chapter 2</a> covered the time dimension, the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="time dimension" data-secondary="overview of" data-type="indexterm" id="id440"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="time dimension" data-tertiary="overview of" data-type="indexterm" id="id441"/>field that is used for the date axis and trending. Tableau Pulse also uses the time dimension to compute different comparison periods. The <em>granularities</em> (unit of time) that Tableau Pulse supports for dates are days, weeks, months, quarters, and years. It also supports the use of fiscal calendars which have a different start date than the default Gregorian calendar. Remember that fields must exist in the published data source to be selected for the time dimension—as such, modifications can be made to the published data source to explore this <span class="keep-together">functionality</span>.</p>

<p>If you’re following along, make these updates to the published data source Superstore Transactions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Create a field called Order Date (Months) by right-clicking the Order Date and creating a custom date field that uses Months as the Detail and the Date Value (see <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_3_1732595608093668">Figure 3-3</a>).</p>

	<figure><div class="figure" id="ch03_figure_3_1732595608093668"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="assets/lait_0303.png"/>

	</div></figure>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Create a field called Order Date (Quarters) by using the same action as the previous step, but this time selecting Quarters as the Detail.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Create a field called Order Date (Years), setting Years as the Detail.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="less_space pagebreak-before">
	<p>Right-click Order Date and select Duplicate; rename the field as Order Date FY.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Set the Fiscal Year Start for the Order Date FY field to July by right-clicking Order Date FY, and then choosing Default Properties &gt; Fiscal Year Start &gt; July (see <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_4_1732595608093688">Figure 3-4</a>).</p>

	</div></figure>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Publish the updated data source to Tableau Cloud.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Now there are four new variations of the Order Date to work with: the first three, which specify the granularity of the date to larger time units (months, quarters, years), and one where the fiscal year starts in July. Let’s go through an example with one of these dates to fully explore Pulse functionality.</p>

<section class="less_space pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="Exploring Time Granularity" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch03_exploring_time_granularity_1732595608107902">
<h2>Exploring Time Granularity</h2>

<p>When you <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="time dimension" data-secondary="time granularity" data-type="indexterm" id="kab026"/>created <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="time dimension" data-tertiary="time granularity" data-type="indexterm" id="kab027"/>custom dates for months, quarters, and years, behind the scenes Tableau truncated the dates to the specificity you set. Another way to think about it is that it rounded the date to the nearest time unit you specified. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_table_1_1732595608098525">Table 3-1</a> shows how Tableau transforms the date June 15, 2024 (06/15/2024).</p>

<table id="ch03_table_1_1732595608098525">
	<caption><span class="label">Table 3-1. </span>Transformation of date based on specified detail</caption>

	</tbody>
</table>

<p>You can now create a metric using one of these new date fields; you can use the Quarters version and find out what happens.</p>

<p>This time, construct a metric for Quantity Sold using Order Date (Quarters) by setting the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><em>Measure</em>: Quantity</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Aggregation</em>: Sum</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Show sparkline values to date as</em>: Non-cumulative</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Time dimension</em>: Order Date (Quarters)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Adjustable metric filters</em>: Region</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>You can leave everything else at its default setting and then save the definition. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_5_1732595608093707">Figure 3-5</a> shows the completed metric from the definition.</p>

<p>The resulting metric doesn’t appear very useful. Instead, it is completely blank, with no metric summary or visualization. Scanning over the metric begins to reveal the <em>why</em> behind this. The time dimension chosen is at the quarter level, so the only possible values for the date in use by Pulse are January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1. Furthermore, the metric identifies that it is Month to Date (next to the Filter button) for the month of June, and the visualization date axis goes from September 1 to September 29. This explains why the metric is blank. There are no September dates <span class="keep-together">to use</span>.</p>

<h2>Setting Minimum Time Granularity</h2>

<p>When you <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Minimum time granularity feature" data-type="indexterm" id="kab043"/>encounter this scenario, you can use the Minimum time granularity feature located in the “Advanced time settings” section of the Definition menu. This feature allows you to set the minimum granularity level that the line chart data points will display at; the options are day, week, month, quarter, and year. Once set, any metrics created from the definition will adhere to this behavior, and users will not be able to select time ranges that are <em>more</em> granular than the specified granularity. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_6_1732595608093727">Figure 3-6</a> shows how applying a default time granularity of quarter impacts the Quantity Sold metric. Notice how the drop-down options for selecting a different time period have been reduced to only those that make sense for dates at a quarter granularity. Similarly, there is a callout when hovering over the dropdown to let the user know this limitation has been set.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 3-6. </span>Quantity Sold metric time period options after specifying a minimum time granularity</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>In this metric example, you had a choice to select the less granular date field, but in reality you may not have that choice. As such, it’s important to recognize the default time granularity behavior and how specifying a minimum time granularity will impact metrics. The time axis used for each time horizon in Pulse when the minimum granularity is set to the default of days is summarized in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_table_2_1732595608098558">Table 3-2</a> along with how each comparison period is computed.

<p>From the table, you can see that many of these time horizons display metrics using days, so it’s safe to say that you’ll get the most benefit out of Pulse if your time dimension is at a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Minimum time granularity feature" data-startref="kab043" data-type="indexterm" id="id452"/>daily <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="time dimension" data-secondary="time granularity" data-startref="kab027" data-type="indexterm" id="id453"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="time dimension" data-startref="kab027" data-tertiary="time granularity" data-type="indexterm" id="id454"/>granularity.</p>

As mentioned earlier, a <em>fiscal calendar</em> has a different start date than the Gregorian calendar (which starts in January).

<p>Construct a metric called Profit from Sales as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>

In these scenarios, using the advanced metric definition feature will be necessary. The <em>advanced metric definition</em><em> </em>functionality grants you access to an editor interface where you can drag and drop fields onto a canvas.

<h2>Calculated Field as Measure</h2>

<p>It’s easy to <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="advanced metric definition" data-secondary="calculated field as measure" data-type="indexterm" id="kab031"/>imagine <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="advanced metric definition" data-tertiary="calculated field as measure" data-type="indexterm" id="kab032"/>that you may need to create a new field based on other fields in your existing data set. Often transformation calculations like ratios, normalizations, or logic statements can add deeper and more impactful analysis and insight to your data. These fields are unlikely to be precomputed in your data source (especially if you’re connecting directly to the source system). Here you have a choice in approach: construct the calculated field in the published data source and then select it in the metric definition as the measure, or calculate the field by using the advanced metric definition feature. Let’s walk through the latter.</p>

<p>Using the same published data source, Superstore Transactions, you’ll construct a new field called Profit Ratio. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_10_1732595608093806">Figure 3-10</a> shows the Advanced Analytics Editor that pops up when you select Advanced Metric Definition located below the “Compared to” section in <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Advanced Analytics Editor" data-type="indexterm" id="id465"/>the Definition menu.</p>

<p>Here you see the familiar worksheet editor with a few minor modifications. The Data pane is still available on the left for access to the fields in your data source. However, instead of having a Rows shelf and Columns shelf, you have a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Measure shelf,  Advanced Analytics Editor" data-type="indexterm" id="id466"/>Measure shelf and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Time Dimension shelf, Advanced Analytics Editor" data-type="indexterm" id="id467"/>Time Dimension shelf. There is still a Filters shelf, but the Marks card is completely missing. Additionally, in this editor you are not able to control the type of visualization that is shown in the canvas.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 3-10. </span>The Advanced Analytics Editor</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>To construct the Profit Ratio calculation, right-click the Profit metric, and choose Create &gt; Calculated Field as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_11_1732595608093825">Figure 3-11</a>.</p>

<p>This action displays a calculation editor where you can enter in the following calculation: <code><strong>SUM(Profit) / SUM(Sales)</strong></code>; name the new field Profit Ratio, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_12_1732595608093843">Figure 3-12</a>.</p>

</div></figure>

<p>This new field can now be dragged onto the Measure shelf. Next, drag Order Date onto the Time Dimension shelf. By default, the Order Date will show up as a <em>discrete</em><em> </em>dimension with <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="YEAR() function" data-type="indexterm" id="id468"/>the <code>YEAR()</code> function—carryover default behavior from the typical visualization authoring experience. A <em>discrete</em> field <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="discrete fields" data-type="indexterm" id="id469"/>in Tableau has a finite list of options for the field value and is visually denoted by the blue color of the field. Additionally, discrete fields are used as headers in visualizations. This is in contrast to a <em>continuous</em> field <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="continuous fields" data-type="indexterm" id="id470"/>that shows up as green and generates a visualization axis, demonstrating the infinite possibilities of potential values. The <code>YEAR()</code> function returns the four-digit year associated with the date. The resulting visualization is shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_13_1732595608093863">Figure 3-13</a>. Paradoxically, the behavior applied to the Order Date field in the visualization is completely ignored when passed back to the metric definition. This means that although the visualization in the Advanced Analytics Editor shows a chart of Profit Ratio by the year of the Order Date, the metric definition and subsequent metrics will access the Order Date by its natural time granularity of days.</p>

<p>When you click Apply to save the advanced metric definition, a warning message pops up reminding you that there must be a measure and a time dimension specified for the definition to be valid, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_14_1732595608093882">Figure 3-14</a>.

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Custom Definition Filter" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch03_custom_definition_filter_1732595608108245">
<h2>Custom Definition Filter</h2>

<p>One of <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="advanced metric definition" data-secondary="custom definition filter" data-type="indexterm" id="kab033"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau Pulse" data-secondary="advanced metric definition" data-tertiary="custom definition filter" data-type="indexterm" id="kab034"/>my <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="custom definition filter" data-type="indexterm" id="kab035"/>favorite features of Tableau is the ability to filter data in a variety of ways. As you saw earlier in this chapter, text fields can be used as definition filters by way of a multiselect include or exclude list. However, discrete dimensions of any field type can also be filtered using <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="wildcard conditions" data-type="indexterm" id="id473"/>a <em>wildcard</em> condition, a condition that relies on the value of an aggregated field or formula, and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="top condition" data-type="indexterm" id="id474"/>a <em>top</em> or <em>bottom</em> condition <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="bottom condition" data-type="indexterm" id="id475"/>that relies on the value of an aggregated field or formula. All these additional filtering types can be applied only as definition filters through the Advanced Analytics Editor. The editor is also the only place you’ll be able to apply a definition filter based on a measure.</p>

<p>Imagine you get a request to construct a metric that displays the quantity of Canon printers, copiers, scanners, and fax machines sold. You may consider building a multiselect definition filter based on the Product Name field in the traditional way, but this has limitations. First, there are several values, and it can be easy to miss one in a large checklist. Next, new products are added to inventory frequently. If you use the typical multiselect list, new values won’t automatically be added to the filter. Instead you’ll end up maintaining the definition filter in perpetuity, as you try to ensure all past and future products are included in the filter. It would be better to construct a wildcard filter based on Product Name. To do this, click the Create Advanced Definition button in a new metric definition window. Then do the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Drag Quantity to the Measure shelf.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Drag Order Date to the Time Dimension shelf.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Drag Product Name to the Filters shelf.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you drag the Product Name to the Filters shelf, the full filter configuration window will appear, as seen in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_16_1732595608093923">Figure 3-16</a>. Click the arrow next to General to collapse the multiselect list functionality, then click the arrow next to Wildcard to expand the options. From here, enter “<code><strong>Canon</strong></code>” in the “Match value” box, and keep the Comparison set to Contains. This will limit the metric to only sum the quantity of products sold that contain the name <em>Canon</em>. Alternatively, you could select “Starts with” if you wanted to enforce that the first word of the Product Name is <em>Canon</em>.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 3-16. </span>Constructing a custom wildcard definition filter</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>To enhance this metric further, you can add Product Name as an adjustable filter in the definition. When metrics from this definition are constructed, end users can select from the dropdown of available Canon products and see them in the Breakdown. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_17_1732595608093942">Figure 3-17</a> shows the newly created metric and breakdown for the Year to Date.</p>

</div></figure>

<p>Now let’s go through an example where the metric has a definition filter based on a measure. This type of filtering is useful anytime you want to isolate data used in a Pulse metric based on a numerical value.</p>

<p>Continuing with Superstore Transactions, you can construct a metric showing the number of items sold where the Discount value was at least 50%. At Superstore, any sale with a discount of 50% or greater represents discontinued products. The department buyers like to track these transactions to minimize the amount of unpopular products stocked. To do this, click the Create Advanced Definition button in a new metric definition window. Then do the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Drag Quantity to the Measure shelf.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Drag Order Date to the Time Dimension shelf.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Drag Discount to the Filters shelf.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="pagebreak-before">Once you drag Discount to the Filters shelf, a menu will pop up (<a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_18_1732595608093961">Figure 3-18</a>). Since this is a numerical filter, you’re given the option to filter by the individual values that exist in the Discount field (“All values”), or you can filter by a specified aggregation. Additionally, because you want to filter individual rows of data that have a discount value of at least 50%, select “All values.” An additional box will display (<a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_19_1732595608093980">Figure 3-19</a>) that allows you to specify the way the data is limited. Here choosing the “At least” option and setting the minimum to 0.5 (50%) makes the most <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Filter menu" data-type="indexterm" id="id476"/>sense.</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 3-18. </span>Filter menu specifying how a measure is to be filtered</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>As a last step, include Sub-Category as an adjustable filter. Remember, the department buyers are on the lookout for products that aren’t sold until they are discontinued, so including the Sub-Category will help them identify if one particular type of product isn’t very popular. <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_figure_20_1732595608093998">Figure 3-20</a> shows the completed metric set to Quarter to Date with Breakdown; it appears that many Binders have been discontinued and sold.</p>

<p>The Advanced Metric Definition feature adds a very robust capability for constructing Pulse Metrics.

<h1>Managing Pulse Metrics</h1>

<p>Now that you’ve seen how to construct advanced Pulse metrics, it’s time to turn your attention to managing the metric definitions and subsequent metrics that are created.

In addition to permissions, content is organized in folders called <em>Projects</em> where permissions can be applied en masse to all content contained within the folder.</p>

<p>Permissions for Pulse metrics start at the published data source level. This alone will determine whether a user will be able to create or follow a metric. For each published data source, several permission types are available (described in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch03_table_3_1732595608098581">Table 3-3</a>).

The first is the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Site Content data source" data-type="indexterm" id="id504"/>Site Content data source. This data source includes the content’s type, name, and key features. The most useful fields from this data source for managing Pulse metrics are the following:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Created At</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Created At field" data-type="indexterm" id="id505"/>UTC timestamp (date and time) when an item was created</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Created At (Local)</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The timestamp (date and time), controlled by the Timezone parameter, when an item was created in your local timezone</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Item Type</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Item Type field" data-type="indexterm" id="id506"/>type of content for Pulse items, either metric definition or metric</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Item Name</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Item Name field" data-type="indexterm" id="id507"/>name of the item</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Owner Email</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Owner Email field" data-type="indexterm" id="id508"/>email address of the user who created the metric</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Description</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Description field" data-type="indexterm" id="id509"/>description listed in the metric definition</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Adjustable Filter Options</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The fields added <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="adjustable metric filters" data-type="indexterm" id="id510"/>and selected as adjustable filter options for the metric definition</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Has Definition Filters</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>A Boolean <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Has Definition Filters field" data-type="indexterm" id="id511"/>denoting whether definition filters are applied to a metric definition</p>

	</dd>
	<dt>Grantee Name</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Grantee Name field" data-type="indexterm" id="id520"/>name of the user or group with permissions specified</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Grantee Type</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Denotes <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Grantee Type field" data-type="indexterm" id="id521"/>whether the grantee is a user or a group</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Item Name</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Item Name field" data-type="indexterm" id="id522"/>name of the piece of content the permissions are applied to</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Item Type</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Item Type field" data-type="indexterm" id="id523"/>type of content</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>User Email</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="User Email field" data-type="indexterm" id="id524"/>email address of the user with permissions</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Has Permission?</dt>
	<dd>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>In this chapter, you’ve had exposure to the advanced features and capabilities in Tableau Pulse. Here are some key takeaways you’ve learned:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Definition filters limit the scope of data included in a metric definition and its subsequent child metrics.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The time dimension can have a granularity of day, week, month, quarter, or year.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For the most benefit, use a time dimension with granularity of a day.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Pulse will use fiscal calendar information assigned to a time dimension to adjust the time horizons and language present in the metric.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>You can offset the end date of a pulse metric by using the advanced time settings.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The advanced metric definition feature allows you to create calculated fields and use more robust filtering options.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Using the advanced metric definition feature replaces the measure, aggregation, time dimension, and definition filters shown in the Value section of the metric definition.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Custom definition filters can be made using the advanced metric definition that include more robust filtering such as wildcard filtering or numerical measure <span class="keep-together">filtering</span>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Permissions for metrics are governed by the permissions a user has for the published data source associated with the metric.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The followers for a metric can easily be managed through the action menu associated with the metric.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Two published data sources in Admin Insights contain metadata information for tracking usage and permissions associated with Pulse.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>In the next chapter, you’ll take a step back and learn what the Pulse environment looks like for an end user (not a metric author). You’ll see how their Pulse summaries are organized and displayed across a variety of environments, including Tableau Mobile. Finally, you’ll see how they can set up digests via email or Slack and what those digests consist of.</p>
