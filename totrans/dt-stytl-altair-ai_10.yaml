    DIKW pyramid and have built a fantastic chart. You should be delighted with your
    work and have probably already shown it to colleagues and perhaps even friends
    and relatives. It pains me, however, to tell you that your work is incomplete.
    The last piece is missing, the one that will transform your graph into a real
    story: wisdom. Wisdom is something very profound, which cannot be extracted simply
    from data. Wisdom also comes from one’s cultural background, experiences, and
    the ability to have good judgment. In this chapter, we will not make philosophical
    disquisitions on wisdom. Still, we will consider wisdom as the ability to propose
    the next steps for the audience to follow after interacting with our story. We
    will also use generative AI as a cultural background and shared experience to
    help us define the next steps.'

    hearts of the audience after reading the story. And this is the addition of wisdom
    to the story. Wisdom allows the audience to be engaged by the story, to be touched,
    and to be ready to do something after reading the story. However, the message
    alone is not enough. The audience must do something after reading the story.

    be one. Even in the case of data storytelling, the addition of an ending to the
    story is envisaged. Unlike a novel, where the ending concludes the story, data
    storytelling should be an open story, in the sense that it should not end with
    the story itself but should expect the audience to do something after reading
    the story.

    started reading a beautiful novel. While you are reading about the protagonist’s
    adventures, suddenly, the novel ends without revealing how or whether the protagonist
    has overcome the challenges or solved the problems. Well, if you limit your chart
    only to the knowledge phase, it’s like a novel without an end. You shouldn’t just
    present your data findings; you should tell the viewer how you think they should
    act upon those findings. There’s a well-known saying that “knowledge is not power;
    it is potential power when used for action.” Here, then, in your chart, you must
    add what we’d call *next steps*. These are implemented as a call to action that
    invites your audience to do something.
  prefs: []

    theoretical. They are the results of your studies and analysis. They propose to
    your audience what to do after seeing your chart—for example, regarding possible
    alternatives or concrete steps to move forward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    data. They must be anchored to something broader, commonly called *wisdom*. Wisdom
    is a cultural treasure trove derived from experience (from the data analyzed)
    and knowledge shared with others.

    a generic next step based only on your own beliefs or experience. It is necessary
    to anchor the next steps to the values of the society in which you live if they
    are to have broad application. These values vary from community to community,
    but fundamental principles must be respected, and the next steps must be anchored
    to them.

    limitations, especially if we don’t have much experience in a specific field.
    In addition to our personal experience, we can use generative AI knowledge to
    build “collective baggage,” to generate wisdom. So far, we have used generative
    AI only to generate content. Now, it’s time to use it as an assistant, a teammate,
    which assists us in thinking and elaborating concepts. While using generative
    AI in such a way, be careful about the ethical problems and other issues this
    may raise, which we will discuss in the next chapter. In practice, we will use
    ChatGPT as a source of experience. In addition to using our singular experience
    to propose next steps, we will use ChatGPT as another source of experience.
