- en: So far, we’ve explored existing reference applications for important areas like
    audio, image, and gesture recognition. If your problem is similar to one of the
    examples, you should be able to adapt the training and deployment process—but
    what if it isn’t obvious how to modify one of our examples to fit? In this and
    the following chapters, we cover the process of building an embedded machine learning
    solution for a problem for which you don’t have an easy starting point. Your experience
    with the examples will serve as a good foundation for creating your own systems,
    but you also need to learn more about designing, training, and deploying new models.
    Because the constraints of our platforms are so tight, we also spend a lot of
    time discussing how you can make the right optimizations to fit within your storage
    and computational budgets without missing your accuracy targets. You’ll undoubtedly
    spend a lot of your time trying to understand why things aren’t working, so we
    cover a variety of debugging techniques. Finally, we explore how you can build
    in safeguards for your users’ privacy and security.

    platform can also be very time-consuming—so one of the biggest risks to any embedded
    machine learning project is running out of time before you have something working.
    The most effective way to reduce this risk is by answering as many of the outstanding
    questions as early in the process as possible, through planning, research, and
    experimentation. Each change to your training data or architecture can easily
    involve a week of coding and retraining, and deployment hardware changes have
    a ripple effect throughout your software stack, involving a lot of rewriting of
    previously working code. Anything you can do at the outset to reduce the number
    of changes required later in the development process can save you the time you
    would have spent making those changes. This chapter focuses on some of the techniques
    we recommend for answering important questions before you start coding the final
    application.

- en: The first question you really need to answer is whether you need the advantages
    of an embedded system or can relax your requirements for battery life, cost, and
    size, at least for an initial prototype. Programming on a system with a complete
    modern OS like Linux is a lot easier (and faster) than developing in the embedded
    world. You can get complete desktop-level systems like a Raspberry Pi for under
    $25, along with a lot of peripherals like cameras and other sensors. If you need
    to run compute-heavy neural networks, NVIDIA’s Jetson series of boards start at
    $99 and bring a strong software stack in a small form factor. The biggest downsides
    to these devices are that they will burn several watts, giving them battery-powered
    lifetimes on the order of hours or days at most, depending on the physical size
    of the energy storage. As long as latency isn’t a hard constraint, you can even
    fire up as many powerful cloud servers as you need to handle the neural network
    workload, leaving the client device to handle the interface and network communications.

    trying to prototype using a device that is easy and quick to experiment with.
    Developing embedded systems is a massive pain in the behind, so the more you can
    tease out the real requirements of your application before you dive in, the more
    chance you have of being successful.

    monitor the health of sheep. The final product will need to be able to run for
    weeks or months in an environment without good connectivity, so it must be an
    embedded system. When you’re getting underway, however, you don’t want to use
    such a tricky-to-program device, because you won’t yet know crucial details like
    what models you want to run, which sensors are required, or what actions you need
    to take based on the data you gather, and you won’t yet have any training data.
    To bootstrap your work, you’ll probably want to find a friendly farmer with a
    small flock of sheep that graze somewhere accessible. You could put together a
    Raspberry Pi platform that you remove from each monitored sheep every night yourself
    to recharge, and set up an outdoor WiFi network that covers the range of the grazing
    field so that the devices can easily communicate with a network. Obviously you
    can’t expect real customers to go to this sort of trouble, but you’ll be able
    to answer a lot of questions about what you need to build with this setup, and
    experimenting with new models, sensors, and form factors will be much faster than
    in an embedded version.

    can. They are cheap, small, and able to run on almost no energy, but these advantages
    only kick in when you actually need to scale. If you can, put off dealing with
    scaling until you absolutely must so that you can be confident that you’re scaling
    the right thing.

    of thumb we’ve found very useful is that neural network models are great at the
    kind of tasks that people can solve “in the blink of an eye.” We intuitively seem
    able to recognize objects, sounds, words, and friends in a comparative instant,
    and these are the same kinds of tasks that neural networks can perform. Similarly,
    DeepMind’s Go-solving algorithm relies on a convolutional neural network that’s
    able to look at a board and return an estimate of how strong a position each player
    is in. The longer-term planning parts of that system are then built up using those
    foundational components.

- en: This is a useful distinction because it draws a line between different kinds
    of “intelligence.” Neural networks are not automatically capable of planning or
    higher-level tasks like theorem solving. They’re much better at taking in large
    amounts of noisy and confusing data, and spotting patterns robustly. For example,
    a neural network might not be a good solution for guiding a sheepdog in how to
    herd a flock through a gate, but it could well be the best approach for taking
    in a variety of sensor data like body temperature, pulse, and accelerometer readings
    to predict whether a sheep is feeling unwell. The sorts of judgments that we’re
    able to perform almost unconsciously are more likely to be covered by deep learning
    than problems that require explicit thinking this doesn’t mean that those more
    abstract problems can’t be helped by neural networks, just that they’re usually
    only a component of a larger system that uses their “instinctual” predictions
    as inputs.

    reading research papers and other publications related to a problem you’re interested
    in. Even if you’re not a researcher this can be a useful process when dealing
    with deep learning because there are a lot of useful accounts of attempts to apply
    neural network models to all sorts of challenges, and you’ll save a lot of time
    if you can get some hints on how to get started from the work of others. Understanding
    research papers can be challenging, but the most useful things to glean are what
    kinds of models people use for problems similar to yours and whether there are
    any existing datasets you can use, given that gathering data is one of the most
    difficult parts of the machine learning process.

    bearings, you might search for [“deep learning predictive maintenance bearings”
    on arxiv.org](https://oreil.ly/xljQN), which is the most popular online host for
    machine learning research papers. The top result as of this writing is a survey
    paper from 2019, [“Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms for Bearing Fault
    Diagnostics: A Comprehensive Review”](https://oreil.ly/-dqy7) by Shen Zhang et
    al. From this, you’ll learn that there’s a standard public dataset of labeled
    bearing sensor data called the [Case Western Reserve University bearing dataset](https://oreil.ly/q2_79).
    Having an existing dataset is extremely helpful because it will assist you in
    experimenting with approaches even before you have gathered readings from your
    own setup. There’s also a good overview of the different kinds of model architectures
    that have been used on the problem, along with discussions of their benefits,
    costs, and the overall results they achieve.'

    it’s worth spending some time in a training environment experimenting to see what
    results you can achieve with no resource constraints. This book focuses on TensorFlow,
    so we’d recommend that you find an example TensorFlow tutorial or script (depending
    on your level of experience), get it running as is, and then begin to adapt it
    to your problem. If you can, look at the training examples in this book for inspiration
    because they also include all of the steps needed to deploy to an embedded platform.

    of your sensor data and trying to match them to something similar in the tutorials.
    For example, if you have single-channel vibration data from a wheel bearing, that’s
    going to be a comparatively high-frequency time series, which has a lot in common
    with audio data from a microphone. As a starting point, you could try converting
    all of your bearing data into *.wav* format and then feed it into the [speech
    training process](https://oreil.ly/dG9gQ) instead of the standard Speech Commands
    dataset, with the appropriate labels. You’d probably then want to customize the
    process a lot more, but hopefully you’d at least get a model that was somewhat
    predictive and be able to use that as a baseline for further experiments. A similar
    process could apply to adapting the gesture tutorial to any accelerometer-based
    classification problem, or retraining the person detector for different machine
    vision applications. If there isn’t an obvious example to start with in this book,
    searching for tutorials that show how to build the model architecture you’re interested
    in using Keras is a good way to get started.

    there’s not much coverage of training datasets. This is because in the academic
    world you’re usually given a pregenerated training dataset that is fixed, and
    you’re competing on how well your model can score on it compared to others. Outside
    of research we usually don’t have an existing dataset for our problem, and what
    we care about is the experience we deliver to the end user, not the score on a
    fixed dataset, so our priorities become very different.

    with data. One that sounds extremely obvious but that we still often forget is:
    look at your data! If you have images, download them into folders arranged by
    label on your local machine and browse through them. If you’re working with audio
    files, do the same and listen to a selection of them. You’ll quickly discover
    all sorts of oddities and mistakes that you didn’t expect, from Jaguar cars labeled
    as jaguar cats to recordings in which the audio is too faint or has been cropped
    and cuts off part of a word. Even if you just have numerical data, looking through
    the numbers in a comma-separated values (CSV) text file can be extremely helpful.
    In the past we’ve spotted problems like many of the values reaching the saturation
    limits of sensors and maxing out, or even wrapping around, or the sensitivity
    being too low so that most of the data is crammed into too small a numerical range.
    You can get much more advanced in your data analysis, and you’ll find tools like
    TensorBoard extremely helpful for clustering and other visualizations of what’s
    happening in your dataset.'

- en: Another problem to watch out for is an unbalanced training set. If you are classifying
    into categories, the frequency at which different classes occur in your training
    inputs will affect the eventual prediction probabilities. One trap that’s easy
    to fall into is thinking that the results from your network represent true probabilities—for
    example, a 0.5 score for “yes” meaning that the network is predicting there’s
    a 50% chance the spoken word was “yes.” In fact the relationship is a lot more
    complex, given that the ratio of each class in the training data will control
    the output values, but the prior probability of each class in the application’s
    real input distribution is needed to understand the real probability. As another
    example, imagine training a bird image classifier on 10 different species. If
    you then deployed that in the Antarctic, you’d be very suspicious of a result
    that indicated you’d seen a parrot; if you were looking at video from the Amazon,
    a penguin would be equally surprising. It can be challenging to bake this kind
    of domain knowledge into the training process because you typically want roughly
    equal numbers of samples for each class so the network “pays attention” equally
    to each. Instead, there’s typically a calibration process that occurs after the
    model inference has been run, to weight the results based on prior knowledge.
    In the Antarctic example, you might have a very high threshold before you report
    a parrot, but a much lower one for penguins.

    technology at all. The most difficult problem in engineering is determining what
    the requirements are, and it’s very easy to spend a lot of time and resources
    on something that doesn’t actually work well in practice for a problem, especially
    because the process of developing a machine learning model takes a long time.
    To flush out the requirements, we highly recommend the [Wizard of Oz approach](https://oreil.ly/Omr6N).
    In this scenario, you create a mock-up of the system you eventually want to build,
    but instead of having software do the decision making, you have a person as “the
    man behind the curtain.” This lets you test your assumptions before you go through
    a time-consuming development cycle to make sure you have the specifications well

- en: How does this work in practice? Imagine that you’re designing a sensor that
    will detect when people are present in a meeting room, and if there’s no one in
    the room, it will dim the lights. Instead of building and deploying a wireless
    microcontroller running a person detection model, with the Wizard of Oz approach
    you’d create a prototype that just fed live video to a person sitting in a nearby
    room with a switch that controlled the lights and instructions to dim them when
    nobody was visible. You’d quickly discover usability issues, like if the camera
    doesn’t cover the entire room and so the lights keep getting turned off when somebody’s
    still present, or if there’s an unacceptable delay in turning them on when someone
    enters the room. You can apply this approach to almost any problem, and it will
    give you precious validation of the assumptions you’re making about your product,
    without you spending time and energy on a machine learning model based on the
    wrong foundations. Even better, you can set up this process so that you generate
    labeled data for your training set from it, given that you’ll have the input data
    along with the decisions that your Wizard made based on those inputs.

    getting that model running fast enough on an embedded platform can take a long
    time, so a great shortcut is to stream data from a sensor in the environment to
    a nearby desktop or cloud machine for processing. This will probably use too much
    energy to be a deployable solution in production, but as long as you can ensure
