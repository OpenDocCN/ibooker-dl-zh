    your confidence and keep your momentum strong. If you hit a tough question, don’t
    get stuck. Mark it for review and move on. Focus on answering everything you’re
    sure about first. Then, on your second pass, you’ll have more time (and less stress)
    to tackle the harder ones.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It sounds simple, but slowing down to read each question can be an effective
    strategy for the exam. Many questions hide important clues in small words like
    *not*, *except*, or *only*—and missing them can completely flip what the question
    is asking.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, a question might ask, “Which of the following is not a benefit
    of using AWS AI services?” That tiny word *not* flips the meaning—you’re looking
    for the exception, not just listing advantages. Miss it, and you could easily
    pick the wrong answer without even realizing it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you hit a multiple-choice question and aren’t sure about the answer, start
    by knocking out any choices that are clearly wrong or don’t make sense. Getting
    rid of the obvious outliers shrinks the field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This trick is especially handy when the right answer isn’t obvious. Narrowing
    down your choices gives you a better shot at making an educated guess. Say you’re
    staring at four answers—if you can eliminate just one, your odds of guessing correctly
    jump from 25% to 33%. Knock out two, and you’ve got a 50/50 chance.
  prefs: []

    options mean less guessing, which helps you stay sharp and keep moving forward
    confidently through the exam.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Staying calm throughout the exam is critical. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed,
    especially if you hit a tough question or notice time slipping away. When that
    happens, it’s natural to feel a surge of stress, but letting that stress take
    over can lead to rushed decisions and mistakes. Instead, take a moment to breathe
    deeply and refocus. A few deep breaths can slow your racing thoughts, which can
    help you regain control and bring a sense of calm back to your mindset. This pause
    may seem minor, but it can make a huge difference in your ability to think clearly
    and stay efficient as you work through each question.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you manage your time well and finish with a few minutes left, use those final
    moments to review your answers. Go back to any questions you marked for review,
    especially if they were ones you found tricky or you rushed through initially.
    These last few minutes can be incredibly valuable. They can allow you to spot
    any small mistakes or second-guess moments. Often, a fresh look at a question
    can bring clarity and help you make a more confident choice. Even minor corrections
    can boost your score, so taking advantage of any extra time to double-check your
    work is a smart move.

    rewards or penalties based on its actions (such as a self-driving car learning
    to avoid obstacles).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Understanding overfitting and underfitting is crucial. Overfitting happens when
    a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data—it’s memorized instead
    of learned. Underfitting means the model is too simple to capture underlying patterns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll also need to know about feature engineering—the process of transforming
    raw data into inputs that improve model performance. Think of it as preparing
    your data so that the model can learn more effectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to choosing the right ML technique, context matters. Regression
    is used for predicting continuous values (like housing prices), while classification
    assigns data into categories (like detecting if an email is spam). Clustering,
    an unsupervised technique, groups similar data points together without needing
    labels.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Expect questions about key AWS services that support AI/ML work. Amazon SageMaker
    is for building, training, tuning, and deploying ML models. For text analysis,
    Amazon Comprehend identifies sentiment, key phrases, and topics. When handling
    audio, Amazon Transcribe converts speech to text for further analysis.

    the act of using it to make predictions on new data. It’s the real-world application
    of everything the model learned during training.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Evaluation metrics also show up a lot. For classification tasks, accuracy measures
    how often the model’s predictions are correct. For regression tasks, metrics like
    root-mean square error (RMSE) are used to evaluate prediction errors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In terms of model deployment, you should understand the difference between batch
    inference and real-time inference. Batch inference processes large groups of data,
    while real-time inference handles single inputs instantly as they come in—critical
    for applications like chatbots or fraud detection.

    drift and model drift. Over time, changes in incoming data can cause a model’s
    performance to slip. Services like Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor can automatically
    track and flag these issues.

    lets you build generative AI applications without needing to configure the infrastructure.
    Bedrock gives developers easy access to FMs from top providers—without needing
    deep ML expertise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, you need to understand FMs. These are huge pretrained models that can
    be fine-tuned for specific tasks. Fine-tuning—taking a general model and retraining
    it with domain-specific data—is critical for adapting AI to particular industries,
    like finance or legal services.

    the smallest unit of text that a model processes. This could be a word, a subword,
    or even a character.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    always output the same result, even when you ask the same question twice. This
    makes the models creative but also requires careful evaluation.

    clear, specific inputs to guide a model’s outputs. For instance, if you want a
    product description that highlights features without exaggerating, the way you
    write the prompt matters a lot.
  prefs: []

    LLMs. Transformers excel at handling sequences of text and understanding context
    across long passages, which is why they’re so effective in chatbots and summarization.

- en: Bedrock Agents automate complex AI workflows, such as a chatbot to retrieve
    customer claims or a tool to search internal documents. This is done by the help
    of RAG. This technique uses vector search. If you’re working with embeddings—numerical
    representations of data—services like Aurora PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension
    let you efficiently search for similar items.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will need to know about context windows. When feeding prompts into FMs,
    the context window defines how much information the model can handle at once.
    A bigger window means the model can “remember” more, which matters for tasks like
    long-form conversation or document summarization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When building chatbots, average response time becomes important. If you’re working
    on devices with tight resource constraints—like drones or IoT devices—optimized
    small language models (SLMs) are the solution for low-latency inference on the
    edge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another important topic is continuous pretraining, which means updating a model
    with fresh data over time to keep its outputs relevant. In fast-changing fields
    like finance or healthcare, this keeps AI systems from becoming obsolete.
  prefs: []

- en: Guidelines for Responsible AI
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the core of responsible AI is fairness. If a model is trained on biased data—say,
    a fraud detection model that overrepresents certain groups—it can lead to serious
    consequences like unfair treatment or regulatory violations. A balanced dataset,
    representing all groups fairly, is critical to building unbiased systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll also need to know about explainability. It’s not enough for AI to be
    accurate; decision makers need to understand why the AI made a certain prediction.
    Using interpretable models or tools like Amazon SageMaker Clarify helps explain
    decisions in simple terms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When working with FMs, you need to manage risks like bias, hallucinations, plagiarism
    (especially if AI-generated content isn’t properly cited), and toxicity (harmful
    or inappropriate content). AWS offers tools like guardrails for Amazon Bedrock
    to help filter and manage AI outputs in real time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another important topic is content moderation. If you’re building chatbots or
    anything interactive, you need to prevent harmful or inappropriate responses.
    Moderation can be handled through content moderation APIs or built-in guardrails
    that flag problematic outputs before they reach users.
