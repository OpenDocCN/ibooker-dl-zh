<h1><span class="label">Chapter 9. </span>Strategies and Techniques for <span class="keep-together">Successfully Taking the AI-900 Exam</span></h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We’ve<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-type="indexterm" id="icd901"/> covered a lot of AI and Microsoft Azure topics in this book—and yes, it can feel like a bit much. So, to prepare for the AI-900 exam, you’re going to need to dig in and put in some serious study time. Just how much time depends on your experience level. If you’re new to the topics, setting aside around 15–20 hours is a solid target. But if you’ve already got a handle on the basics, you might be looking at closer to <span class="keep-together">5–10</span> hours of study time.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We have included a practice exam that can help you get a sense of whether you’re ready to take the exam. It’s also a great idea to review the glossary at the end of this book because many exam questions focus on definitions of AI and Azure terms.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This chapter first will dive into some useful strategies for approaching the exam. Then, we’ll break down the key topics by category, giving you a summary to focus on as you prep.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Understanding the Exam Experience" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="i09_chapter9_understanding_the_exam_experience_1742068263977807">&#13;
<h1>Understanding the Exam Experience</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Microsoft<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="sandbox" data-type="indexterm" id="id979"/> has a <a href="https://oreil.ly/QqH3I">sandbox</a> that shows the exam experience. It’s important to check it out so as to get a sense of what to expect. <a data-type="xref" href="#i09_chapter9_figure_1_1742068263972753">Figure 9-1</a> shows what it looks like.</p>&#13;

</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>On the left, you’ll find options to take a break, change up the color scheme, or get help if you need it. At the top of the screen, a progress bar shows how many questions you’ve already chosen. You’ll also see a timer to keep track. Each question will appear in the center screen as you go. If you’d like to revisit a question later, select “Review later.” You can also leave feedback about any issues or suggestions you have regarding the exam.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Manage Your Time" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="i09_chapter9_manage_your_time_1742068263977877">&#13;
<h2>Manage Your Time</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="strategies for" data-type="indexterm" id="icd902"/> it <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="timing" data-type="indexterm" id="id980"/>comes to managing your time during the AI-900 exam, it’s all about pacing yourself and staying focused. You’ll have 45 minutes to tackle somewhere between 40 and 60 questions, giving you roughly one minute per question.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Start with the questions you know—those easy wins will give you confidence and help you keep momentum. If a question stumps you, don’t waste precious time. Just mark it for review and come back later. Making a first pass to answer what you know will free up time to dig into the more challenging questions during the second pass.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Read Questions Carefully" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="i09_chapter9_read_questions_carefully_1742068263977939">&#13;
<h2>Read Questions Carefully</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Carefully<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="question format" data-type="indexterm" id="id981"/> reading each question might seem like obvious advice, but it can genuinely make a big difference in your exam performance. Exam questions often contain specific keywords like <em>not</em>, <em>except</em>, or <em>only</em>, which can completely change the intended answer. These tiny words are easy to overlook in a rush, and missing them could send you down the wrong path. For example, a question that asks, “Which of the following is not a benefit of using Azure AI?” requires an entirely different thought process than one asking for a straightforward list of benefits. Missing that one <em>not</em> could mean selecting the exact opposite answer of what’s required.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Taking a few extra seconds to read the question carefully helps you fully understand what’s being asked. This clarity means you’re more likely to select the correct answer on your first attempt, which in turn reduces the need to go back and double-check or change answers later.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Use the Process of Elimination" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="i09_chapter9_use_the_process_of_elimination_1742068263978000">&#13;
<h2>Use the Process of Elimination</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="multiple-choice questions" data-type="indexterm" id="id982"/>you’re faced with multiple-choice questions, especially those where you’re uncertain about the answer, start by removing any options that are clearly incorrect or don’t make sense. Crossing off these outliers will narrow your choices, making it much easier to focus on what’s left. This is particularly useful when the answer isn’t immediately obvious because it allows you to home in on the most plausible options instead of wasting time debating all of them.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Eliminating wrong answers also increases your chances of guessing correctly if you’re still unsure after narrowing down. For example, in a question with four choices, removing just one incorrect answer boosts your odds from 25% to 33% if you’re left to make an educated guess. Remove two, and you’ve got a 50/50 shot. It’s a simple technique, but it can be a lifesaver when you’re dealing with those last few tricky questions. Additionally, by focusing on fewer options, you reduce mental strain, helping you conserve energy for the rest of the exam. This approach not only streamlines your decision-making process but also keeps you moving forward with confidence and efficiency.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Stay Calm and Double-Check Your Answers" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="i09_chapter9_stay_calm_and_double_check_your_answers_1742068263978060">&#13;
<h2>Stay Calm and Double-Check Your Answers</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Staying<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="staying calm during" data-type="indexterm" id="id983"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="checking answers" data-type="indexterm" id="id984"/> calm throughout the exam is essential. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed, especially if you hit a tough question or notice time slipping away faster than expected. When that happens, it’s natural to feel a surge of stress, but letting that stress take over can lead to rushed decisions and mistakes. Instead, take a moment to breathe deeply and refocus. A few deep breaths can slow your racing thoughts, which can help you regain control and bring a sense of calm back to your mindset. This pause may seem minor, but it can make a huge difference in your ability to think clearly and stay efficient as you work through each question.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you manage your time well and finish with a few minutes left, use those final moments to review your answers. Go back to any questions you marked for review, especially if they were ones that you found tricky or that you rushed through initially. These last few minutes can be incredibly valuable. They can allow you to spot any small mistakes or second-guess moments. Often, a fresh look at a question can bring new clarity and help you make a more confident choice. Even minor corrections can boost your score, so taking advantage of any extra time to double-check your work is a smart <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="strategies for" data-startref="icd902" data-type="indexterm" id="id985"/>move.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Key Concepts to Review" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="i09_chapter9_key_concepts_to_review_1742068263978121">&#13;
<h1>Key Concepts to Review</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="topics covered by" data-type="indexterm" id="icd903"/>the next few sections, we’ll take a look at the main sections of the exam and the key concepts to focus on. These concepts are in line with the main topics from the AI-900 study guide: responsible AI, ML, computer vision, NLP, and generative AI.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="AI Fundamentals and Responsible AI" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="i09_chapter9_ai_fundamentals_and_responsible_ai_1742068263978182">&#13;
<h2>AI Fundamentals and Responsible AI</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Ethics<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-type="indexterm" id="id986"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="principles for responsible AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id987"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="responsible AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id988"/> is a key part of the exam. This is why it’s a good idea to memorize the six core principles of responsible AI: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. We covered these in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#i03_chapter3_overview_of_ai_workloads_and_key_use_cases_1742068261133633">Chapter 3</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When a question pops up, try to match it with one of these principles. For instance, if the question mentions “making systems understandable to users,” think transparency. If it’s about “avoiding bias based on gender or ethnicity,” you’re looking at fairness.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Pay extra attention to<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="scenario-based questions" data-type="indexterm" id="id989"/> scenario-based questions. They often throw real-world business examples at you and ask which principle is most relevant. Here’s a tip: watch for keywords. “Bias” points to fairness, “understanding how it works” signals transparency, “security of personal data” means privacy and security, and “governance framework” usually leads to accountability. Sometimes, it may seem like a scenario touches on more than one principle, but focus on finding the main one.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Another big area is AI workloads and knowing when to use each type. Expect questions where you need to connect a business problem to the right AI solution. For example, if it’s about making large amounts of data searchable, think knowledge mining. Interactive conversations? Go with conversational AI. The trick is knowing not just what a service does but also what problem it actually solves.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>AI governance and implementation also come up a lot. Think in order: first, identify potential harms, then measure them, and finally, mitigate them. You might also get questions about specific Microsoft policies, such as why Microsoft has retired facial recognition features for certain purposes, such as to detect emotions, gender, and age.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Machine Learning" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="i09_chapter9_machine_learning_1742068263978240">&#13;
<h2>Machine Learning</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ML (machine learning)" data-seealso="Azure Machine Learning" data-type="indexterm" id="id990"/> you’re diving into ML and data science questions, it’s key to get the basics down—especially the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. You’ll see this distinction pop up in practical scenarios.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="supervised learning" data-type="indexterm" id="id991"/> In supervised learning, watch for clues like “labeled data” or historical data with known outcomes. For instance, if a question is about predicting house prices based on previous sales, it’s a supervised learning case. Specifically, it’s regression, because house prices are continuous numbers. On the flip side, if it’s about grouping customers or spotting patterns with no labeled outcomes,<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="unsupervised learning" data-type="indexterm" id="id992"/> think unsupervised learning, usually clustering.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It’s also crucial to know the terms used in <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="training ML models" data-secondary="features versus labels" data-type="indexterm" id="id993"/>model training, especially <em>features</em> versus <em>labels</em>. When a question involves predictions, immediately zero in on which variables are your features (inputs) and which is your label (what you’re trying to predict). For example, when predicting customer churn, demographics and purchase history are features while churn status is the label.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you’re tackling<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure Machine Learning" data-type="indexterm" id="id994"/> Azure Machine Learning and AutoML questions,<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AutoML (Azure Automated Machine Learning)" data-type="indexterm" id="id995"/> remember the workflow sequence: create a workspace first, prepare your data, split it into training and validation sets, and then train the model. Pay attention to<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="evaluation metrics" data-type="indexterm" id="id996"/> evaluation metrics, too, such as <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> for regression models and accuracy for classification models. The exam often asks about which metrics suit different models. Also, watch for overfitting (good performance on training data, but poor performance on validation data) and underfitting (poor performance on both).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>With<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure Machine Learning Designer" data-type="indexterm" id="id997"/> Azure Machine Learning Designer, think in terms of pipelines. You create the pipeline first, add datasets next, and then add training modules. The order matters, so don’t get tricked by questions that suggest skipping steps. Also, know the difference between training and inference pipelines: training pipelines are for building the model, and inference pipelines are for deploying it.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Finally, practice spotting the right algorithm for different business problems. If the question is about predicting numbers (like sales or temperature), think regression. For sorting items into categories (like spam detection or image classification), that’s classification.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Computer Vision" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="i09_chapter9_computer_vision_1742068263978307">&#13;
<h2>Computer Vision</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="computer vision" data-type="indexterm" id="id998"/> you’re dealing with computer vision questions, understanding the different image analysis tasks is key. The test often checks if you can tell the difference between image classification (figuring out what’s in an image), object detection (finding multiple objects and marking them with boxes), and semantic segmentation (labeling each pixel by category). When a scenario question mentions “identifying multiple objects in an image with their locations,” think object detection. If it’s about “categorizing the main subject of an image,” that’s image classification.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Azure AI Vision <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Vision" data-secondary="overview of" data-type="indexterm" id="id999"/>services come with prebuilt models that you’ll need to be familiar with. For instance, some models are specialized for specific tasks, such as recognizing celebrities and landmarks. The test often asks about what’s supported (like OCR) and what’s not (like emotion detection, which was retired because of ethical concerns). Watch for questions about output formats, too—for instance, image analysis returns confidence scores for each feature, while object detection gives bounding boxes and labels.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For OCR, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OCR (Optical Character Recognition)" data-secondary="limits of" data-type="indexterm" id="id1000"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Optical Character Recognition (OCR)" data-secondary="limits of" data-type="indexterm" id="id1001"/>you’ll want to know both what it can do and its limits. OCR is for reading text, so understand the difference between recognizing printed text versus handwriting and remember use cases like digitizing medical records or pulling text from documents. The exam may give scenarios to check if OCR is the right tool. Keep in mind that OCR is for text extraction only, not for broader image analysis or facial detection. What’s more, OCR can be used alongside other services like translation for document processing.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Facial detection and recognition questions are a bit more nuanced now, thanks to Microsoft’s ethical AI principles. Be clear about what the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Face Service" data-type="indexterm" id="id1002"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Face Service" data-type="indexterm" id="id1003"/> Azure AI Face Service does: detecting faces, verifying identity, and redacting faces, but no longer recognizing emotions. The test may check your knowledge of these ethical limitations. Also, know the difference between facial detection (finding faces in an image) and facial verification (confirming identity), as they’re used in different situations.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Finally,<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="DALL-E model" data-type="indexterm" id="icd1006"/> DALL-E models can create images from text prompts, edit images, or make variations of existing images. When these questions come up, know what DALL-E can and can’t do. For example, DALL-E can generate images based on descriptions but doesn’t handle tasks like image classification or facial recognition.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Natural Language Processing" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="i09_chapter9_natural_language_processing_1742068263978361">&#13;
<h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="NLP (natural language processing)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1004"/> you’re getting into Azure’s NLP services, the first step is to know which service handles which task. Start by identifying the main goal: are you trying to understand meaning (language understanding), pull out specific details (key phrase extraction), gauge emotions (sentiment analysis), or translate languages? For instance, if the question is about analyzing customer reviews for positive or negative feelings, you’re looking at sentiment analysis. If it’s about finding main topics in a document, that’s key phrase extraction.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For Azure AI Language <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Language" data-type="indexterm" id="id1005"/>services, it’s about knowing what each feature can—and can’t—do. Pay close attention to the difference between similar features. Named entity recognition (NER), <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="NER (named entity recognition)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1006"/>for example, identifies types of words (like people or places), while entity linking takes it a step further by connecting those words to a knowledge base. Sometimes, a scenario may seem to fit multiple services, but your job is to pick the best one. Also remember that specific features, such as language detection, give outputs like ISO codes and confidence scores, which can help you eliminate wrong answers.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When it comes to translation, make sure you understand the difference between the translation services. Azure AI Translator<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Translator" data-type="indexterm" id="id1007"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Translator Service" data-type="indexterm" id="id1008"/> does text-to-text translation while Azure AI Speech <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Speech" data-type="indexterm" id="id1009"/>handles speech-to-text and text-to-speech. For document-translation <span class="keep-together">questions</span>, know whether you’re dealing with a single file (synchronous) or multiple files (asynchronous). The exam often asks which service to pick based on details like file volume or whether real-time translation is needed. Also remember Azure AI Custom Translator: <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure AI Custom Translator" data-type="indexterm" id="id1010"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Custom Translator Service" data-type="indexterm" id="id1011"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="custom translation models" data-type="indexterm" id="id1012"/>it’s tailored for specific industry jargon and domain-specific terms.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For language models, especially<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Azure OpenAI Service" data-type="indexterm" id="id1013"/> Azure OpenAI, know the types of models and what they’re good at. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GPT models" data-type="indexterm" id="id1014"/>GPT models are great for understanding and generating natural language while embedding models are built for comparing and analyzing text similarity. Watch for questions on system messages and prompt engineering. Also be ready for questions about responsible AI with language models, covering areas like content filtering and safety.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>With speech-related questions, focus on both the technical abilities and the real-world uses of Azure AI Speech services. Get familiar with the differences between speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and speech translation. Certain features, such as speaker recognition, language identification, and voice assistants, are worth <span class="keep-together">remembering</span>.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Generative AI" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="i09_chapter9_generative_ai_1742068263978414">&#13;
<h2>Generative AI</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="generative AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id1015"/> you’re handling questions about generative AI and LLMs, it’s crucial to know what each model family is best at. GPT models are built for generating and understanding text and code while<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="DALL-E model" data-startref="icd1006" data-type="indexterm" id="id1016"/> DALL-E is for creating images. The test often checks if you can pick the right model for the task. For example, a question that involves generating Python code or filling in code snippets is GPT territory, not DALL-E.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For copilot-related questions, remember that copilots are AI assistants embedded in applications. Their main job is to bridge the gap between users and the AI models. This makes it easy for people to get help with everyday tasks using natural language. When you see these questions, think about how <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="copilots " data-type="indexterm" id="id1017"/>copilots boost productivity, such as by suggesting solutions, completing tasks, or offering context-sensitive help. The exam may ask if a copilot is the right choice for a business need, so remember that they’re more than just chatbots. They’re designed to understand context and give tailored assistance.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Prompt engineering<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="prompt engineering" data-type="indexterm" id="id1018"/> has become a hot topic. Know the parts of effective prompting, especially system messages that set the context and limitations for a model’s responses. The exam might quiz you on how to steer model outputs effectively. For example, this can be using system messages to specify tone, format, or other constraints. Be ready for questions on different prompting techniques, and understand when each one is the right fit.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Questions about content safety and harm mitigation are all about responsible AI layers. Know the different layers that help prevent harm: the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="safety system layer, in generative AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id1019"/> safety system layer for <span class="keep-together">content</span> filtering, the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UX (user experience) layer, in generative AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id1020"/> user experience layer for clear documentation, and the metaprompt and grounding layer <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="metaprompt and grounding layer, in generative AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id1021"/>for setting <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI-900 certification exam" data-secondary="topics covered by" data-startref="icd903" data-type="indexterm" id="id1022"/>context.</p>&#13;
