- en: You must be confident by now in building and evaluating a core RAG pipeline.
    Applications such as “chat with your PDF” or question-answering systems based
    on web pages should no longer be a mystery. This part of the book will guide you
    in improving your RAG pipeline and also lay out a blueprint for the layers required
    to build a production-ready RAG system.

- en: In chapter 6, you’ll be able to try out different techniques for improving the
    basic RAG pipeline into a more advanced one. You’ll get to know the techniques
    that improve RAG in three different stages—before, during, and after retrieval.
    You’ll also learn about modularity and how modern RAG systems are made up of replaceable
    components.

    layers without which any RAG system will fail, the essential layers that improve
    system performance, and the enhancement layers that focus on usability, scalability,
    and efficiency of the system.
