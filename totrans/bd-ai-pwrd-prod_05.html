&#13;
<p>In <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic thinking" data-type="indexterm" id="icd501"/>my classes and seminars, I often hear questions like: How should I introduce AI into my product strategy? What can AI do to add value to users and grow my organization and company? Should I build in-house or buy off-the-shelf?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This chapter focuses on thinking strategically as an AI product leader and on the important decisions you might need to make.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Your Business Strategy: Evaluating AI As a Solution" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch05_your_business_strategy_evaluating_ai_as_a_solutio_1736793247595189">&#13;
<h1>Your Business Strategy: Evaluating AI As a Solution</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Traditionally,<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic thinking" data-secondary="business strategy" data-type="indexterm" id="icd502"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="business strategy" data-type="indexterm" id="icd521"/> only product leadership (group PMs, VPs, directors) would be involved in discussions on the strategic direction of a product area. However, what I have been observing nowadays with AI is that some strategic decisions are taking place even at the lowest level of a product manager’s career, and it is crucial for all PMs, regardless of level, to involve leadership and seek feedback and input from them regularly while adopting AI. This company-wide conversation is even more vital when you’re considering, for example, whether to build your AI capabilities in-house or outsource the job to external vendors. I will cover the build-versus-buy debate later in this chapter, but for now, know that having a cohesive AI strategy that permeates your company’s culture is very important.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s assume for a second that you work for a company that already has an existing product offering with little to no AI, and you’re confident that the organization does need AI. Your first step should be to research and answer the following questions:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li class="pagebreak-before less_space">&#13;
	<p>Map AI’s capabilities to your company’s mission. Can AI contribute to your company’s goals? How can it solve existing problems? How might it augment the current user experience or streamline operations?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Identify key <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pain points" data-secondary="identifying" data-type="indexterm" id="id1034"/>pain points in your existing product offering(s) to solve. Where might AI make a significant difference for a specific user segment of your current product(s)? Examples might be improving personalization, automating routine tasks, or offering predictive analytics to enhance <span class="keep-together">decision</span> making.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Estimate the impact on users. How will adding AI affect your user base? Will it improve their experience or make the product more accessible? Will it enhance the core KPIs you and the company care about?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Introducing AI might solve some problems, but it could also introduce new complexities. What are the benefits of integrating AI? <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="integration compatibility" data-type="indexterm" id="id1035"/>What are the potential downsides (such as increased development costs or longer time to market)? How much importance do you attach to each of these benefits and downsides? When you weigh them against one another, what is the result?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>AI features need constant optimization and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="maintenance" data-secondary="business strategy and" data-type="indexterm" id="id1036"/>maintenance. Can your company sustain the long-term upkeep of any AI-driven features you choose to integrate? Does the company have the resources in place that it will need to provide continued support for the AI-driven product, including talent, expertise, and infrastructure?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>How are your <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="competitive analysis" data-type="indexterm" id="id1037"/>competitors using AI? Is there a competitive edge involved in adopting AI in your product? How does the market landscape influence the urgency and approach of your AI integration?</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In the <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#appa_appendix_1736793244857323">Appendix</a>, you can find a worksheet designed to help you with this process.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="AI Might Not Always Be the Answer" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch05_ai_might_not_always_be_the_answer_1736793247595258">&#13;
<h2>AI Might Not Always Be the Answer</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="fix_tracking">The <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic thinking" data-secondary="considering that AI may not be the solution" data-type="indexterm" id="icd503"/>decisions you make around AI are never straightforward. They require balancing the company’s immediate business needs with its long-term strategic goals. For instance, should you develop in-house AI capabilities, which might take longer but offers more control and customization? Or should you purchase third-party solutions to get to market faster, with the trade-off being less flexibility?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Every decision in your business strategy must consider internal factors such as available talent, infrastructure, and expertise, as well as external factors such as market trends and competition. You also need to identify your short-term and long-term AI strategies to ensure that your AI initiatives are suited to your company’s broader strategic objectives.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Adding AI just for the sake of adding AI is a common mistake. By the time you know what problem your AI solution is intended to solve, you should be well aware that not every problem requires an AI solution. Incorporating AI into a product without a thoughtful AI strategy is a recipe for disaster. When you’re considering integrating AI into a business process or product, make sure there’s a clear reason—and a problem that <em>only</em> AI can solve.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>While AI has the potential to solve a wide range of problems, it’s important to recognize that it isn’t always the right tool for the job. In some cases, using AI may introduce unnecessary complexity, costs, or risks. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="when not to use" data-type="indexterm" id="icd503a"/>Here are some scenarios where AI might not be the best solution:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Don’t use AI when there is another way to solve the problem.</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Chances are good that alternative solutions will have less risk, cost less, and lead to equally good outcomes. Before diving into AI, consider whether simpler approaches could achieve the same result. Can you solve the problem more quickly and at a lower cost without AI? Sometimes the answer is yes, and that’s OK. For example, basic automation scripts or rule-based systems might be sufficient for certain tasks. Always evaluate the problem space thoroughly to ensure that AI <em>really is </em>the most effective method to pursue.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Don’t use AI if you can’t get good data.</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Data is the heart of AI. Having enough high-quality data<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data quality" data-secondary="insufficient high-quality data" data-type="indexterm" id="id1038"/> is crucial for training effective AI models. If obtaining quality data is a struggle from the start and ends up being impossible, AI might not be the best path forward. Not every use case can provide the volume, diversity, and quality of data necessary for AI to work reliably. In these situations, consider alternatives that do not rely heavily on data, such as deterministic logic or simpler statistical methods. (See <a data-type="xref" href="#ch05_your_data_strategy_populating_and_adapting_your_m_1736793247595574">“Your Data Strategy: Populating and Adapting Your Model”</a> for more.)</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt class="pagebreak-before less_space">Don’t use AI if you’re not ready for the challenges of productionizing it.</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Building an AI prototype is easy, but <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="productionizing AI, challenges of" data-type="indexterm" id="id1039"/>productionizing AI is not. Many organizations underestimate the challenges involved in deploying and maintaining AI systems in real-world environments. If AI is in its infancy in your organization, you need a compelling reason to go down this path. Robust production requires significant infrastructure investment to support scalability, security, latency, and continuous monitoring—factors that add significant overhead to your AI initiative. Additionally, consider your current tech stack: some companies acquire smaller startups with great technology, but later have to rewrite all of their code due to incompatibilities. This is a critical factor to assess early on.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Don’t use AI if you’re worried it will cost too much.</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>AI solutions can be expensive to build, deploy, and maintain. From hiring data scientists to securing computational resources, the costs can quickly add up. Before moving forward, ask yourself if outsourcing AI development would strain your organization’s budget. Also, weigh these costs against the potential benefits to determine if AI offers a justifiable return on investment. Sometimes a simpler, less costly solution can address the problem adequately.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt class="fix_tracking">Don’t use AI if you aren’t prepared to maintain and iterate on your solution <span class="keep-together">indefinitely</span>.</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Do you have the data, infrastructure, and models you need to develop and maintain an AI solution? Remember that the work doesn’t stop once you train and launch a model. Ongoing maintenance is essential, so you’ll need to plan for it.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In short, although AI is a powerful tool, it’s not always the answer. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="when not to use" data-startref="icd503a" data-type="indexterm" id="id1040"/>While there are no definitive right or wrong answers, these questions will help guide you toward the best path forward. After addressing them, the key is to determine whether the problem is significant enough to warrant the investment of time and resources.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Equally important is evaluating the associated costs and trade-offs. As discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03_essential_ai_pm_knowledge_1736793246808259">Chapter 3</a>, trade-offs aren’t about simply choosing between A and B; instead, think of them as sliders that need careful adjustment. By exploring and balancing the interactions between multiple factors, you can tailor your approach to achieve the optimal <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic thinking" data-secondary="considering that AI may not be the solution" data-startref="icd503" data-type="indexterm" id="id1041"/>outcome.</p>&#13;

<h2>Disruptive or Sustaining? Navigating the Innovator’s Dilemma</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Once <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic thinking" data-secondary="business strategy" data-tertiary="Innovator’s Dilemma" data-type="indexterm" id="icd504"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Innovator’s Dilemma" data-type="indexterm" id="icd505"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="disruptive innovations" data-type="indexterm" id="icd505a"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sustaining innovations" data-type="indexterm" id="icd505b"/>you’ve identified how AI can be integrated into your product to solve a problem or create a new offering, it’s time to consider whether your AI solution is disruptive or sustaining<em>.</em> This is a critical strategic question, and understanding where your AI product fits can have a huge impact on the direction your company takes. Every innovative company faces this challenge, best known as the “Innovator’s Dilemma,” a concept Harvard Business School<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Harvard Business School" data-type="indexterm" id="id1042"/> professor Clayton Christensen<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Christensen, Clayton" data-type="indexterm" id="id1043"/> introduced in his book <em>The Innovator’s Dilemma </em>(Harvard Business Review Press, 1997). In the book, Christensen explores how successful companies, despite doing everything right, can still fail when faced with “disruptive technologies,” pointing out that the strategies that led to a company’s current dominance may become ineffective when new technologies and innovative approaches emerge, threatening to change the status quo.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The dilemma presents two types of innovation. A <em>sustaining</em><strong> </strong>innovation improves upon existing products to better meet customer needs. It’s typically incremental—improving performance, reducing defects, or enhancing user experience—and it aligns with the company’s current strategy. For example, adding AI-driven predictive analytics to an existing product to offer better personalization might fall under sustaining innovation. The key here is that sustaining innovations meet your customers’ <em>current</em> needs.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>By contrast, a <em>disruptive </em>innovation introduces a product or solution that initially targets niche markets or unmet needs in a way that may seem inferior to the current offerings. These innovations often appear less powerful, less refined, or less desirable to the mainstream market. However, they address a niche need so effectively that they eventually redefine the market. Disruptive innovations meet your customers’ <em>future</em> needs, potentially creating new markets or reshaping entire industries.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Take the camera market, for example. Before the rise of smartphones, point-and-shoot cameras were the go-to option for anyone who wanted to take high-quality digital photos. But smartphones disrupted that market. Early on, smartphone cameras<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="smartphone cameras" data-type="indexterm" id="id1044"/> didn’t match the quality of point-and-shoot options, but they were <em>good enough</em> for most people and offered the added convenience of always being at hand. What was once a niche offering (phone cameras) quickly became the dominant product. Despite being “inferior” in quality at first, smartphones met the evolving needs of users—portability and convenience—eventually leading to the decline of standalone camera markets.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>What would a sustaining innovation for the camera market have been? Perhaps improving point-and-shoot features like megapixel count or autofocus speed—enhancements that serve existing users but don’t fundamentally change the nature of the product or market. Now consider how this applies to AI product development. The decision between pursuing a sustaining AI innovation and pursuing a disruptive one is crucial. Sustaining AI solutions may involve integrating existing AI technologies to improve current offerings—such as automating routine processes or improving customer service chatbots<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="customer service chatbots" data-secondary="sustaining innovations" data-type="indexterm" id="id1045"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="chatbots" data-secondary="sustaining innovations" data-type="indexterm" id="id1046"/>. These AI-driven improvements align with what your product already offers and are designed to help you stay competitive within your current market.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>On the other hand, disruptive AI innovations might challenge the way your company has traditionally solved problems. Perhaps you’re using AI to create an entirely new product category that targets an unmet need, even if it seems to offer less functionality or appeal at first glance. The risk is greater, but so is the potential reward, if you can carve out new opportunities in niche markets.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Disruptive innovations tend to begin with lower performance in the areas that traditional customers value. They might not have the polish, reliability, or robust feature set that mature products possess. This makes it difficult for larger companies, especially those serving demanding clients, to justify investing in these nascent technologies. After all, why would a company move forward with a new AI-driven product if it doesn’t immediately match the features of its existing, proven offerings?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>However, disruptive innovations succeed because <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="metrics" data-secondary="disruptive innovations and" data-type="indexterm" id="id1047"/>they <em>prioritize different performance metrics</em>. Rather than focusing on current users, they target new or underserved segments. Over time, these innovations evolve, and as they improve, they often surpass traditional products in ways that redefine <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic thinking" data-secondary="business strategy" data-startref="icd504" data-tertiary="Innovator’s Dilemma" data-type="indexterm" id="id1048"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Innovator’s Dilemma" data-startref="icd505" data-type="indexterm" id="id1049"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="disruptive innovations" data-startref="icd505a" data-type="indexterm" id="id1050"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sustaining innovations" data-startref="icd505b" data-type="indexterm" id="id1051"/>the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic thinking" data-secondary="business strategy" data-startref="icd502" data-type="indexterm" id="id1052"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="business strategy" data-startref="icd521" data-type="indexterm" id="id1053"/>market.</p>&#13;

<h1>Your AI Strategy: To Build or to Buy?</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>One <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic thinking" data-secondary="building AI solutions versus buying" data-type="indexterm" id="icd506"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="building AI solutions versus buying" data-type="indexterm" id="icd518"/>of the most frequent and critical questions that arise when adopting AI <span class="keep-together">is whether</span> to build an in-house AI solution or buy one from a third-party vendor. Both approaches come with distinct advantages and challenges. I’ll break <span class="keep-together">down the</span> key benefits of each approach and guide you through the decision-making process.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">First, let’s look at the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="building AI solutions versus buying" data-secondary=" advantages of building" data-type="indexterm" id="id1054"/>advantages of building your own AI model in-house:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Customization</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p class="fix_tracking">Building<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="customization of AI solutions" data-type="indexterm" id="id1055"/> AI in-house allows you to tailor the solution precisely to your product’s requirements. This ensures a solution that can evolve as your business scales and pivots. Custom models, built from the ground up, can be tailored to handle highly specific tasks but require more data and resources. They are suitable for highly specialized tasks for which a pretrained model’s performance might fall short. Custom models provide more flexibility but require significant data, compute resources, and expertise.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Ownership</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Full <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ownership of technology" data-type="indexterm" id="id1056"/>ownership over the technology means that you control both the data and the AI model. This is particularly valuable in industries where proprietary data and differentiation are key to gaining a competitive edge.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Data security</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Keeping<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="security" data-secondary="building AI solutions versus buying" data-type="indexterm" id="id1057"/> data in-house reduces the risk of breaches and allows for greater control over compliance with data privacy regulations such as <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)" data-secondary="building AI solutions versus buying" data-type="indexterm" id="id1058"/>GDPR and HIPAA<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1059"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1060"/>.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Long-term cost savings</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>While the initial costs of developing an in-house AI system are higher, the long-term savings may outweigh these up-front expenses. Once developed, there are no ongoing licensing or subscription fees.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are also <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="building AI solutions versus buying" data-secondary=" advantages of buying" data-type="indexterm" id="id1061"/>advantages to buying a pretrained AI solution:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Faster time to market</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>A <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="time to market" data-type="indexterm" id="icd507a"/>pretrained model or third-party solution allows you to integrate AI into your product more quickly. This can be a key competitive advantage in fast-moving markets. Pretrained models offer a head start, providing general capabilities that can be fine-tuned for specific applications.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Access to expertise</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Buying from established vendors gives you access to specialized AI knowledge and models that have been tested across multiple use cases and industries, ensuring reliability. Pretrained models are ideal when you want to leverage existing general AI capabilities, especially in domains such as NLP <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="image recognition" data-secondary="building AI solutions versus buying" data-type="indexterm" id="id1062"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="NLP (natural language processing)" data-secondary="building AI solutions versus buying" data-type="indexterm" id="id1063"/>and image recognition.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Scalability</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Many pretrained AI solutions are built with scalability <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="scalability" data-secondary="building AI solutions versus buying" data-type="indexterm" id="id1064"/>in mind, which means they can easily handle growing datasets and increased traffic without requiring significant rework.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Continuous updates and support</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>AI evolves rapidly, and with a third-party solution, you can benefit from continuous updates and improvements. This ensures that your system remains up-to-date with minimal effort on your part.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Now that you know the advantages of each approach, deciding whether to build an in-house AI solution or buy a pretrained AI model comes down to your broader AI strategy and the specific context of your business. Here are the key factors to consider<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="building AI solutions versus buying" data-secondary="factors to consider" data-type="indexterm" id="id1065"/> when making this important decision:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Core competency</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>If AI is core to your product’s value proposition, building in-house allows you to fully customize and control the solution, offering a better alignment with your business needs. This can enhance the overall user experience and scalability. However, if AI is only a supporting feature, buying a third-party solution can help you quickly integrate the necessary functionality at a lower cost.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Resources and expertise</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Building AI in-house requires significant investment in talent, including data scientists and ML engineers, as well as infrastructure such as data storage and compute power. If your organization has the resources and the long-term commitment needed to build AI internally, this option may deliver a tailored solution. On the other hand, if your company lacks the expertise or infrastructure, buying from a third-party provider is a viable option. Third-party vendors bring with them specialized knowledge and have already invested in the talent and infrastructure necessary for AI development.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Time to market</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Developing <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="time to market" data-startref="icd507a" data-type="indexterm" id="id1066"/>​custom AI solutions can be time-consuming, which may delay your product’s launch. If speed is a priority, buying pretrained AI models allows for faster deployment and enables your company to stay competitive in fast-moving markets. This is especially critical in industries where being first to market offers a significant advantage.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Long-term strategy</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>When AI plays a crucial role in your long-term strategy, building in-house can provide more flexibility and control in the future. Custom-built AI solutions allow your company to pivot or evolve its AI capabilities as needed. However, for short-term solutions or when AI is not a long-term focus, purchasing a pretrained model can fulfill immediate needs without the resource-heavy investment required for in-house development.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Cost</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p>Building AI internally requires up-front investments in infrastructure, talent, and time but could offer long-term savings by avoiding licensing fees. Purchasing a pretrained AI model can reduce initial expenses and time to market, although recurring licensing or usage fees can accumulate over time, impacting the total cost of ownership.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Uncertainty <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="uncertainty, embracing and managing" data-type="indexterm" id="id1067"/>is also a big factor in this decision, as you’ll recall from <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01_the_role_of_ai_product_managers_1736793245224676">Chapter 1</a>, where we discussed the probabilistic nature of AI. AI comes with its own set of risks, particularly in areas like algorithmic failures, scalability issues, and responsible AI practices. For example, Tesla’s Autopilot AI has faced scrutiny due to accidents in real-world environments, highlighting the risks involved in deploying AI in critical applications. Purchased AI solutions may alleviate some of these risks by offering tried-and-tested models, but they also make you dependent on external vendors for updates, fixes, and continued support.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Last, it’s always a good idea to research what your <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="competitive analysis" data-type="indexterm" id="id1068"/>competitors are doing. For example, in 2019 Salesforce <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Salesforce" data-type="indexterm" id="id1069"/>acquired Tableau<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tableau" data-type="indexterm" id="id1070"/>, a leading data visualization company, to quickly enhance its analytics capabilities and compete more effectively with rivals. Building a comparable solution in-house would have taken Salesforce significantly longer, potentially causing the company to lose ground to competitors like SAP<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="SAP" data-type="indexterm" id="id1071"/> and Oracle<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Oracle" data-type="indexterm" id="id1072"/>.</p>&#13;

<p>The decision you make should align with your company’s core competencies, available resources, and strategic objectives. In some cases, a hybrid approach—leveraging third-party AI solutions for certain functionalities while developing proprietary AI in-house for others—can be the most effective strategy. We’ll discuss that option <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="building AI solutions versus buying" data-secondary="decision matrix" data-startref="icd517" data-type="indexterm" id="id1073"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic thinking" data-secondary="building AI solutions versus buying" data-startref="icd507" data-tertiary="decision matrix" data-type="indexterm" id="id1074"/>next.</p>&#13;

For example, you could build your proprietary <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="content recommendation systems" data-secondary="hybrid approaches" data-type="indexterm" id="id1078"/>recommendation engine in-house, but use a pretrained language model like GPT-3 for NLP tasks. Another example might be a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="music streaming services" data-secondary="hybrid approaches" data-type="indexterm" id="id1079"/>music streaming service, where you could initially use a pretrained LLM to understand song lyrics and generate metadata. However, if your aim is to develop a unique model that identifies and classifies niche musical genres, building a custom model might be more effective.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For example, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenAI" data-secondary="GPT-4 model" data-type="indexterm" id="id1080"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GPT-4 model" data-type="indexterm" id="id1081"/>OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, available via API, allows businesses to integrate advanced natural language understanding capabilities into their products without extensive development time.

<h1>Your Data Strategy: Populating and Adapting Your Model</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic thinking" data-secondary="data strategy" data-type="indexterm" id="icd509"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data strategy" data-type="indexterm" id="icd516"/>you learned in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02_the_ai_product_development_lifecycle_1736793245641371">Chapter 2</a>, data is the backbone of AI. However, depending on the product and use case, acquiring high-quality, labeled, real-world data can be challenging. In such cases, using <em>synthetic data</em><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="synthetic data" data-secondary="defined" data-type="indexterm" id="id1086"/>—artificially generated data that simulates real-world scenarios—becomes a viable option. It’s also important to recognize that the choice of algorithms and learning methods is only part of the equation. Equally crucial is deciding how to adapt these models to meet your product’s unique needs. This section discusses both of these data decisions.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Synthetic Versus Real-World Data" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ch05_synthetic_versus_real_world_data_1736793247595635">&#13;
<h2>Synthetic Versus Real-World Data</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic thinking" data-secondary="data strategy" data-tertiary="synthetic versus real-world data" data-type="indexterm" id="icd510"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data strategy" data-secondary="synthetic versus real-world data" data-type="indexterm" id="icd515"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="synthetic data" data-secondary="real-world data versus" data-type="indexterm" id="icd512"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="real-world data, synthetic data versus" data-type="indexterm" id="icd512a"/>talk about synthetic data. It’s a tool that can be incredibly powerful when used correctly, but it’s not a silver bullet. Think about it as functioning for AI like a flight simulator functions for pilots. Before getting into a real plane, pilots spend countless hours in simulators that create synthetic scenarios they might encounter in the real world. The same principle applies to AI.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In general, I have seen synthetic data work wonders in healthcare. I first generated synthetic data during my <a href="https://oreil.ly/09HiZ">PhD research</a>, when I needed data from influenza outbreaks to try to predict when an infection would die down. Companies like <a href="https://oreil.ly/oazJT">Syntegra</a> are<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Syntegra" data-type="indexterm" id="id1087"/> creating incredibly realistic (but fake) medical records and images that let AI models learn without compromising anyone’s privacy.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="autonomous vehicles" data-type="indexterm" id="id1088"/> Self-driving car companies use synthetic data too: Waymo’s<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Waymo" data-type="indexterm" id="id1089"/> virtual testing environment, called <a href="https://oreil.ly/i6t33">SimulationCity</a>, lets <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="SimulationCity" data-type="indexterm" id="id1090"/>the company test its vehicles in millions of synthetic scenarios. It’s much safer and more efficient than trying to encounter every possible road situation in real life.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>But here’s the thing—synthetic data has its limits. If you’re building a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="content recommendation systems" data-secondary="synthetic versus real-world data" data-type="indexterm" id="id1091"/>recommendation engine for your ecommerce site, there’s no substitute for real user behavior. You can generate synthetic shopping patterns all day long, but they won’t capture the subtle nuances of how real people browse, compare, and make purchasing decisions. The same goes for <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="NLP (natural language processing)" data-secondary="synthetic data" data-type="indexterm" id="id1092"/>NLP. Synthetic conversations often miss the messy, wonderful complexity of how people actually communicate.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The key lies in knowing when to use which type of data. Here’s what I’ve learned from working with various AI products:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Use synthetic data when . . .</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>You’re dealing with sensitive information (as in healthcare or financial services).</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>You need to test rare but critical scenarios (such as accidents for self-driving cars).</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>You’re in early development and need to move fast.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>Real data collection could be prohibitively expensive.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Stick to real data when . . .</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>User behavior and preferences are central to your product.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>You need to capture cultural or contextual nuances.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
	<li>&#13;
	<p>You’re making high-stakes decisions that directly affect users.</p>&#13;
	</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In some cases, the best approach might be a hybrid <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hybrid approaches to AI" data-type="indexterm" id="id1093"/>one. Start with synthetic data to get your models up and running, then gradually incorporate real data as you gather it. This is exactly <a href="https://oreil.ly/9jDIb">what Tesla does</a>: it<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Tesla" data-secondary="synthetic versus real-world data" data-type="indexterm" id="id1094"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="autonomous vehicles" data-secondary="synthetic versus real-world data" data-type="indexterm" id="id1095"/> uses both synthetic scenarios and real-world driving data to train its autonomous driving systems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Generating good synthetic data is an art in itself. The data needs to maintain the statistical properties of real data while avoiding any accidental patterns that could bias your model. Always validate your synthetic data against real samples when possible, and keep checking that your model’s performance holds up in real-world <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic thinking" data-secondary="data strategy" data-startref="icd510" data-tertiary="synthetic versus real-world data" data-type="indexterm" id="id1096"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data strategy" data-secondary="synthetic versus real-world data" data-startref="icd515" data-type="indexterm" id="id1097"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="synthetic data" data-secondary="real-world data versus" data-startref="icd512" data-type="indexterm" id="id1098"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="real-world data, synthetic data versus" data-startref="icd512a" data-type="indexterm" id="id1099"/>conditions.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="less_space">Fine-tuning, RAG, or Grounding?</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and grounding methods intersect with multiple learning techniques and are essential in determining how your AI model will function, integrate with existing data, and enhance user experiences. Several factors come into play, including latency, data availability, accuracy requirements, and scalability. Here’s a more detailed look at each option, along with real-world AI product examples.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Fine-tuning" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch05_fine_tuning_1736793247595751">&#13;
<h3>Fine-tuning</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Fine-tuning<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="fine-tuning models" data-type="indexterm" id="id1100"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic thinking" data-secondary="data strategy" data-tertiary="fine-tuning" data-type="indexterm" id="id1101"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data strategy" data-secondary="fine-tuning" data-type="indexterm" id="id1102"/> involves taking a pretrained model and training it further on a specific dataset tailored to the problem at hand. It’s most useful when your model needs to adapt its understanding based on new data to specialize in a particular task or domain. It’s best used for scenarios where the accuracy of the model is paramount and the task is well-defined. Fine-tuning is resource intensive: it requires substantial labeled data and computational power.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Content moderation tools,<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="content moderation tools" data-type="indexterm" id="id1103"/> like those used by social media platforms such as Facebook<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Meta" data-secondary="Facebook" data-type="indexterm" id="id1104"/>, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Facebook" data-secondary="content moderation" data-type="indexterm" id="id1105"/>are often fine-tuned to specialize in detecting hate speech or inappropriate content. The investment in fine-tuning is justified by the need for high precision and minimal errors. As another example, an audio streaming service might use fine-tuning to generate better personalized <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="content recommendation systems" data-secondary="fine-tuning models" data-type="indexterm" id="id1106"/>recommendations, training the model on user-specific listening behaviors to predict what songs a user is likely to enjoy.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="RAG" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch05_rag_1736793247595804">&#13;
<h3>RAG</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>RAG <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1107"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1108"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic thinking" data-secondary="data strategy" data-tertiary="retrieval-augmented generation" data-type="indexterm" id="id1109"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data strategy" data-secondary="retrieval-augmented generation" data-type="indexterm" id="id1110"/>enhances generative models by incorporating a retrieval mechanism that accesses a large corpus of information. It provides up-to-date information dynamically, without requiring the model itself to be fully retrained. It’s best used for dynamic, information-heavy contexts in which the model needs to access specific information that is not directly encoded in its parameters.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>RAG is particularly effective for use cases in which information changes frequently, such as news or market trends. To continue our example, a music streaming service<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="music streaming services" data-secondary="RAG" data-type="indexterm" id="id1111"/> might use RAG to <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="content recommendation systems" data-secondary="RAG" data-type="indexterm" id="id1112"/>recommend music or podcasts that align with current social media trends or recent news about artists, offering real-time relevance. For instance, if a particular song becomes popular on TikTok<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="TikTok" data-type="indexterm" id="id1113"/>, RAG could retrieve this information and use it to tailor recommendations quickly.</p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Grounding" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="ch05_grounding_1736793247595865">&#13;
<h3>Grounding</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Grounding<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="grounding models" data-type="indexterm" id="id1114"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strategic thinking" data-secondary="data strategy" data-tertiary="grounding" data-type="indexterm" id="id1115"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data strategy" data-secondary="grounding" data-type="indexterm" id="id1116"/> uses preexisting context, usually via prompt engineering, to guide a base model’s behavior. It’s a more lightweight approach, adding instructions or context to influence the model’s responses or predictions. I have seen it used when rapid iterations are needed and the model requires only slight adjustments or context to perform effectively.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This approach is less resource intensive than fine-tuning and does not require large datasets. For instance, in a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="customer service chatbots" data-secondary="grounding models" data-type="indexterm" id="id1117"/>customer support chatbot<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="chatbots" data-secondary="grounding models" data-type="indexterm" id="id1118"/> like those used by ecommerce platforms, you could implement grounding by prompting the model to adopt a particular tone, focus on specific information, or follow a predefined conversation flow. This can be especially useful during product experimentation, where changes need to be made quickly without retraining the model.</p>&#13;
