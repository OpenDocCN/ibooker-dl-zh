- en: The concept of AI can be traced back to the mid-20th century. In 1956, John
    McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon organized the
    Darmouth Workshop, which is often credited for the birth of AI, as during this
    workshop the term “artificial intelligence” was coined. The researchers wanted
    to see how machines can mimic human intelligence and be used for everyday life.
    In the initial years, the researchers focused on symbolic AI. This approach involved
    using symbols and logic to represent the knowledge and solve the problems. The
    progress in AI slowed down during 1970s and 1980s when the funding was reduced.
    The late 20th century and the early 21st century saw the resurgence of AI, thanks
    to the development of machine learning techniques like neural networks and deep
    learning. The new enabled AI systems started to make predictions and decisions
    by learning from the historical data. With the availability of cloud computing,
    better service, and more processing power, the training of algorithms was faster,
    easier, and cheaper, and there was a shift from rule-driven to data-driven algorithms.
    With the launch of libraries like TensorFlow and Keras, creating deep learning
    networks became something that anyone with an internet connection could do.

    sciences, manufacturing, and many other industries and business functions, improving
    efficiency and decision-making processes, increasing customer satisfaction, and
    decreasing costs. The integration of AI with robotics has resulted in auto-driving
    cars, drones, automation, and digital twins. We now have very intelligent robotic

    you know, supervised learning is for labeled datasets, where we have a target
    variable to train an algorithm. Using supervised learning solutions for categorical
    variables, we can predict the probability for an event to happen or not—for example,
    if the customer will churn or not, whether the incoming credit card transaction
    is fraud or genuine, and so on. Similarly, using supervised learning solutions
    for numeric variables, we can predict an estimated value for a numeric variable—for
    example, what the sales of a store next month will be or the number of calls a
    call center can expect in the next week. Discriminative models predict the conditional
    probability for an output given an input value, and hence they are a great solution

    a series of layers, typically consisting of convolutional or transposed convolutional
    layers in the case of image generation or recurrent layers for text generation.

    the specific objectives and use cases for GenAI within our business priorities.
    This requires determining where it can provide the most value—whether that’s customer
    support and solutions, data analysis/visualizations, personalization, content
    generation, or others.'

    the data available and assess its quality and quantity. High-quality data is essential
    for training and maintaining GenAI models. We also must ensure that our IT infrastructure
    can support the integration of AI systems.'

    an existing pretrained model. If we decide to build a custom model, we will have
    to consider working with AI development teams or external vendors with expertise
    in the field. This is a vital step, as we should choose teams that have the required
    skills to develop the models. It is better to take recommendations from the experts
    in the field.'

    here, and the next step is to gather and preprocess the data necessary to train
    the GenAI model. This may involve cleaning, labeling, and structuring the data
    for training. Data preprocessing is a critical step for model accuracy. The data
    should be representative of the business problem at hand.'

    This process may require powerful hardware and deep learning expertise. There
    might be some iterations to the model to align with our specific business requirements.
    This step can take a lot of time, depending on the quantity of the data, the quality
    of the infrastructure, and the complexity of the solution.'

    We have to regularly update the model with fresh data to keep it accurate and
    effective. We should always plan for scalability and ongoing maintenance. It is
    important to implement monitoring systems to track GenAI’s performance and user
    feedback. This information can help us in making continuous improvements and address
    any problems that arise.'
