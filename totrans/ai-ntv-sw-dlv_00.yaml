- en: 'The software industry stands at a pivotal moment. Systems grow more complex
    by the day, user demands escalate exponentially, and the cost of failure, whether
    financial, reputational, or operational, has never been higher. Yet despite decades
    of progress, many teams remain shackled to outdated practices: manual deployments,
    reactive firefighting, and toolchains that crumble under their own complexity.
    This book exists to bridge the gap between where we are and where we need to be.
    It’s a map for navigating the shift from brittle, high-stakes delivery to AI-driven
    autonomy—a future where software deploys itself, systems self-heal, and innovation
    outpaces risk.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As software engineers by training, we’ve spent years studying the evolution
    of software development and delivery. But OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT in late 2022
    marked a pivotal moment for us. Like many in the field, we saw generative AI not
    just as a coding assistant but as a catalyst for reimagining entire delivery pipelines.
    Over the next three years, we hypothesized, tested, and validated how AI, from
    code generation to agentic workflows, would reshape deployment, testing, and governance.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We wrote this book because the stakes of software delivery have changed. The
    rise of microservices, cloud-native architectures, and AI-generated code has rendered
    traditional DevOps 1.0 practices insufficient. Teams now juggle 10+ tools in a
    single pipeline, battle “dependency hell,” and face threats like SolarWinds-style
    supply chain attacks, all while racing to meet user expectations forged by consumer
    tech giants.

- en: Existing resources focus on historical DevOps concepts or speculate about AI
    in abstract terms. This book connects the dots. Grounded in 25 years of lessons,
    from Agile’s early wins to the Kubernetes orchestration revolution, we pair technical
    rigor with forward-looking insights. Modern tools exemplify this shift. We show
    how AI isn’t just automating tasks but reshaping collaboration, governance, and
    innovation.

    and new frameworks emerge monthly. While we’ve strived to future-proof this book,
    we acknowledge that some details will evolve. What won’t change are the core principles:
    automating toil, prioritizing resilience, and aligning delivery with business
    value.'
