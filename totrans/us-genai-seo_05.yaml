    using it. So what do you need to get started? That’s what we’ll address in this

    in [Chapter 6](ch06.html#ch06_advanced_use_cases_for_generative_ai_in_seo_1748359259642070)),
    you will likely use a variety of tools to create content. This chapter focuses
    on both the necessary and the optional tools for optimizing content creation.
    Every tool has its advantages and disadvantages, so this chapter explains what
    can be done with these tools and the pitfalls to avoid.

    AI tools into those strategies requires changes to corporate procedures. Your

    to adjust. We’ll cover some of the concerns that you and your organization might
    have when generative AI is integrated into your content creation process.

    their expertise, and you want to make sure you’re getting it. If AI-detection
    tools know that your content is machine generated, then Google can detect it as
    well. We cover these tools, show you how to use them, and discuss the pros and
    cons of using AI detection.

    If so, you can try something like “Please update your response to focus on Danny
    Sullivan the race car driver.” You can see this illustrated in the figures in
    the following section, [“An Example of Iterative Prompting”](#ch03_an_example_of_iterative_prompting_1748358214008583).

    These are guidelines that Google provides to people who manually evaluate the
    quality of Google’s search results (“Quality Raters”). These Quality Raters review
    Google’s search results, examine pages that earn high-ranking positions, and then
    score those pages. Based on these scores, Google can see how well its algorithms
    are doing at providing quality content in the results.

    we noted that EEAT isn’t a direct ranking factor, except for sites focused on
    health or financial topics, but the role of the Quality Raters is to indicate
    how they think content should be ranked, and they are expected to consider EEAT

    in [Chapter 2](ch02.html#ch02_essential_background_on_generative_ai_1748358211788823)
    and this chapter, when AI is used to create content, it’s prone to making mistakes,

    can think of this as being strongly correlated with brand. A strong brand is something
    that many larger companies have, but individuals who are experts in their field
    can also have a strong brand. Users tend to associate a strong brand with credibility

    your market—for your company, for your key SMEs, or for both.
