<p class="body"><a id="marker-1"/>I assume you’re reading this book because you’ve made the wise choice to learn how to use artificial intelligence (AI) to go far beyond what you could do in WordPress on your own. Over the course of the book I’ll show you how to rapidly build and polish a fully professional and unique website of your own. One you can be quite proud of. The book’s chapters progress from basic to more advanced topics. And I’ll explain everything in clear detail with concrete examples and step-by-step instructions.</p>
<p class="body">Many of the use cases in this book focus on building and polishing websites. But Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help you with <i class="fm-italics">any</i> intellectual or creative task. You’ll learn how AI can make your efforts impressive and exceptional. No matter what you’re working on!</p>
<div class="fm-sidebar-block">

<p class="fm-sidebar-text">AI is improving at an extremely rapid, actually unprecedented, pace. Developments are announced daily. So, I’ve set up a blog (<a class="url" href="https://aipoweredwp.signalstreaming.com">https://aipoweredwp.signalstreaming.com</a>) to keep you up-to-date with revisions to this book and new developments in AI in general. You’ll also be able to ask questions and post comments.</p>
</div>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-2"/>It’s a good idea to build and manage your WordPress website yourself. WordPress was designed from the ground up to be easy to use. I teach three online WordPress courses on<a id="idTextAnchor000"/> ed2go, and my students master the tools and skills they need to create excellent sites <i class="fm-italics">in</i> <i class="fm-italics">six weeks!</i> With this book, you can become that proficient too.</p>
<p class="body">Hiring a developer to build your site can be expensive and frustrating. First, you have to find a developer that you hope is competent. Many developers are more skilled at programming than design, so you can easily end up with a smoothly functioning site that looks, to put it kindly, less than attractive. Too much media, or too little. A crowded, barren, or unbalanced layout. Inappropriate or unreadable typefaces. An unsuitable color scheme. You get the idea.</p>
<p class="body">Or, you may have the opposite problem: your developer is an artist with a strong design background, but struggles with building a site that’s functional, logical, and efficiently navigated. Nice-looking though.</p>
<p class="body">After the site’s built, there is often considerable additional cost when you have to call the developer back for site maintenance. And your site <i class="fm-italics">will</i> need maintenance. That said, if you don’t have the time but do have the money, there are great developers out there—and some are quite reasonable.</p>
<p class="body">Note that design improvements shouldn’t be neglected either—site design trends change over time, and you want your site to remain contemporary. If you can maintain the site yourself, you’ll save both money and time (developers are sometimes busy and have to put you in a queue). With AI and WordPress, site maintenance—like site building—is far easier than most people realize, as you’ll soon find out.</p>
<p class="body">First, we’ll establish some context for WordPress and why there is such a chasm between it and its competitors. Then, we’ll look at some basic concepts around using AI to make your site impressive and exceptional. You’ll discover AI’s many versatile uses, and also learn how to write effective prompts (requests to AI systems) to get the best results.</p>
<p class="body">Finally, you’ll learn how to overcome the major challenges faced by any WordPress site builder. And how helpful AI can be there, too.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> Some of the examples in this book are based on a fictitious “Instant Pot Recipes” practice website, but it’s fine if you want to just apply these lessons to your own site. You’ll find instructions in the appendix that show you step-by-step how to create the practice site, and install the Twenty Sixteen theme it uses. Also, this book focuses on the classic WordPress editor, rather than the Gutenberg block editor. So for the practice site, you should install the Classic Editor plugin (also explained in the appendix). Nonetheless, I’ve included parallel instructions throughout the book showing how to use the Gutenberg block editor for those who prefer it.<a id="idIndexMarker001"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_3">1.1 Why WordPress wins</h2>
<p class="body">Most other website-building systems have fallen by the wayside over the years. WordPress, however, has grown to dominate the internet, and now enjoys 65% of the market share. The closest runner-up is Joomla, with only 4.6%. Until WordPress came along, building a website required you to struggle with the three terrible “T’s”—time, technicality, and tedium. Most people simply couldn’t do it! WordPress made its debut in 2003, and the result was that constructing websites quickly became far simpler and far more efficient. And since 2011, WordPress usage has increased, on average, 12% each year. <a id="idIndexMarker002"/><a id="marker-3"/></p>
<p class="body">WordPress is a major improvement over traditional site-builders like DreamWeaver and Drupal. For one thing, WordPress eliminates the need to write programming code. As a result, pretty much everyone can now build impressive sites for themselves—whether the site’s purpose is professional, commercial, educational, personal, or business. And as you’ll see, a great site can be built in weeks, not months.</p>
<p class="body">Let’s take a look at the primary reasons that WordPress is so superior to the alternatives:</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Easy to install</i>—A simple, one-click installation tool available in most WordPress hosting services is all that’s needed to mount a new, empty WordPress site on your hosting account. No technical knowledge is required.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">No computer programming on your part—</i>WordPress is code-free (unless you want to code). People with no technical background find they don’t need to know how to do programming. WordPress creates programming code behind the scenes for you. You work <i class="fm-italics">visually</i> by moving a slider, dragging and dropping, clicking to choose from a list of options, and so on. You produce your site pages in a highly efficient system that is graphical, not programmatic.</p>
<p class="list">You create and modify site content without needing to know how to program HTML, PHP, JavaScript, or CSS code. You adjust page layout, response to a button or link click, text qualities, and other site elements with your mouse, not mind-numbing keyboard coding. Put simply, the user interface is effective, friendly, and intuitive.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">A large collection of professionally designed themes—</i>If you prefer, you can leave your site design up to expert designers. You can choose from more than 30,000 free or premium themes. A WordPress theme governs how a site looks—the color scheme, layout, typefaces, and other elements of style. You can, however, customize and modify these default visual elements to make your site unique. And, you can make it easy for nontechnical people to master quickly.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Customizable</i>—WordPress is highly customizable, making it simple for users to modify their website’s design and functionality. If you’re so inclined, you <i class="fm-italics">can</i> add your own programming code, but it’s not required.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">A huge selection of plugins</i>—You can find more than 60,000 plugins in the official WordPress directory alone! They add functionality to a site, such as an animated image gallery, a shopping cart checkout system, a set of thousands of fonts, a backup system, connections to social media, and many more features. You install these plugins with a simple mouse click.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Built-in media management</i>—WordPress includes a built-<a id="idTextAnchor001"/>in Media Library that makes it easy to upload, organize, modify, and insert images and other media into your posts and pages.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Responsive design</i>—Most popular WordPress themes are designed to be <i class="fm-italics">responsive</i>, which means they automatically adjust your content to the size of the screen it’s viewed on, making it easy to create mobile-friendly websites even on a large computer monitor. However, before the site is made public, you should test it on various screen sizes: cellphone, tablet, and computer monitor. This way, you can tweak things if need be.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">SEO-friendly</i>—WordPress is built wi<a id="idTextAnchor002"/>th search engine optimization (SEO) in mind, making it possible for you to modify your site to achieve a higher rank when people search for your site’s topic.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Efficient page-building</i>—You’ll find many tools that streamline constructing a successful site in a short time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">Now that we’ve set out why WordPress is an excellent choice in the vast majority of website-building contexts, let’s move on to the other major topic of this book—AI and how it can help take your work in WordPress to the next leve<a id="idTextAnchor003"/>l.<a id="idIndexMarker003"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_4">1.2 Why use artificial intelligence</h2>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-4"/>The Industrial Revolution saw the invention of machines such as McCormick’s reaper, which significantly amplified human physical abilities. Today, with AI, we are on the brink of a much more rapid and profound transformation. AI is amplifying our minds—our intelligence, talents, and creativity. What’s more, AI is surpassing us in some ways and threatening to surpass us in all ways.<a id="idIndexMarker004"/></p>

<p class="body"><a id="marker-6"/>AI can also be a master of pretty much any other job you would hire someone to do for you (as long as it’s not physical, like vacuuming).</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_7">1.2.3 You move from creator to curator</h3>
<p class="body">Notice that when you employ AI for tasks like these, you move up to a higher position in the organization. AI is your <i class="fm-italics">assistant.</i> So that makes you, by definition, its boss. You don’t have to do research and produce rough drafts. AI does that. You become a <i class="fm-italics">curator</i> rather than a creator. <a id="idIndexMarker008"/><a id="idIndexMarker009"/></p>
<p class="body">AI presents you with several titles, essays, illustrations, or whatever, and you then pick the best one, ask AI to try again, or tell AI to make some specific changes to the one you like most. You’re not a graphic artist; you’re the head of the art department.</p>
<p class="body">If AI writes a draft of an article you assigned to it, then you become the editor, judging and polishing the writing. Or, you send it back for revision o<a id="idTextAnchor005"/>r fact-checking. But ultimately, you’re a senior editor with a junior assistant. Or when brainstorming, you pick the best of several suggestions. You originate a project, providing <i class="fm-italics">concepts, instructions,</i> and <i class="fm-italics">goals</i> rather than preparing preliminary sketches, researching, or doing first drafts. You oversee apprentices who do the legwork and the prep work and bring you samples to pick from. In other words, you don’t originate content. You propose, evaluate, and critique it.<a id="idIndexMarker010"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_8">1.3 How to use artificial intelligence</h2>
<p class="body">Let’s explore the many ways you can use AI, and focus first on learning to communicate with machine intelligence. This is known as <i class="fm-italics">prompting</i>, and it’s a form of high-level programming. You type in a request or, in some instances, converse verbally with the AI.<a id="idIndexMarker011"/><a id="marker-7"/></p>
<p class="body">Traditionally, computer programming demanded a considerable investment of time to learn a computer language. These languages were usually obscure, truly deserving the term <i class="fm-italics">coding</i>. It was as if you were using a cryptic, semi-symbolic dialect. Errors (“bugs”) were common and could be challenging to solve.<a id="idIndexMarker012"/></p>
<p class="body">Now, all that’s changed. The distance between humans and machines is shrinking. You communicate with AI in your natural language, not in a computer language. So, communication is much easier. But still, much like directing an assistant, you do want to be specific, as you’ll soon see.</p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_9">1.4 Which AI system should you use?</h2>
<p class="body">We’ll explore many AI systems throughout this book. They have varying strengths and specialties. Now let’s consider which AI systems are best for various tasks. We’ll start with the currently most powerful—Chat GPT. However, the latest versions of Claude and Perplexity are challenging GPT’s lead.<a id="idIndexMarker013"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_10">1.4.1 Which system to use?</h3>
<p class="body">Each AI system has its strengths, but as of this writing, seven are outstanding (this <i class="fm-italics">is</i> a horse race, though, and leadership in the various skills AI is mastering will change):</p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Not Diamond</i> (<a class="url" href="https://www.notdiamond.ai">www.notdiamond.ai</a>)—If asked which AI system is the best for a beginner, right now my recommendation is Not Diamond because it’s an aggregator, a portal to <i class="fm-italics">all the best</i> AI systems, including GPT, Claude, and Perplexity. Not only is it free to use (for now), but it also allows you to provide a prompt, and then it decides (quite accurately) which of the leading AI systems to submit your prompt to based on their various strengths. <a id="idIndexMarker014"/></p>
<p class="list">For example, to give you cutting-edge, state-of-the-art language-understanding and language-generation capabilities, Not Diamond will use GPT; for highly accurate real-time research, Perplexity; for writing computer programs, Claude; and so on. Not Diamond also allows you to give your prompt to more than one AI system. Then, you decide which one did the best job.</p>
<p class="list">Not Diamond has access to all the leading AI systems. Includ<a id="idTextAnchor006"/>ed are G<a id="idTextAnchor007"/>PT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o<a id="idTextAnchor008"/> Mini, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3.5 S<a id="idTextAnchor009"/>onnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro (Google’s cha<a id="idTextAnchor010"/>tbot), Gemini 1.5 Pro (<a id="idTextAnchor011"/>0801), Llama 3.1 70B (Llama is developed by <a id="idTextAnchor012"/>Meta), Llama 3.1 405<a id="idTextAnchor013"/>B, and Perplexity. The only exceptions are AI art systems such as Midjourney.</p>
<p class="list">One way to use an aggregator such as Not Diamond is to start with one AI system and then switch to a different one based on their various capabilities. GPT excels at reasoning but only recently got real-time access to the internet. Perplexity is great at scraping current data. So, for example, you can ask Perplexity to put together a 2000-word summary of the current trends in the prices of gold coins and also list the economic factors that are in play affecting these prices. Then, submit that data to GPT, and ask it to predict future near-term trends.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Chathub</i> (<a class="url" href="https://chathub.gg/">https://chathub.gg/</a>)—A worthy competitor to Not Diamond, you can also add it as an extension to Chrome. You get the major AI systems and can prompt as many as six of them at once.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">Poe</i> (<a class="url" href="https://poe.com/">https://poe.com/</a>)—This is another alternative to Not Diamond. Here, you can sample most of the best AI systems for one monthly price. You can work here with various systems and see which you like best. Like Not Diamond, Poe doesn’t have Midjourney, currently the leading AI art generator.<a id="idIndexMarker015"/></p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list"><i class="fm-italics">GPT</i> (<a class="url" href="https://chatgpt.com/">https://chatgpt.com/</a>)—Created by OpenAI and used by Microsoft and Apple, this AI is best for essays, articles, blog posts, research papers—most things relating to the written word and information in all its forms. GPT version 4o also excels at math, programming, and reasoning. <a id="idIndexMarker016"/><a id="marker-8"/></p>
<p class="list">It’s also now multimodal, meaning it can work with visual and other media. GPT is quite impressive and versatile and usually leads the pack. GPT also writes and debugs computer programs effectively. It’s good at summarizing text. And it can remember information between chats, not just within them. Plus, you can build Custom GPTs that have custom data you feed them and built-in prompts. So they behave as AIs specialized for your purposes.</p>
<p class="list">However, in June 2024, OpenAI seemed to put on the brakes. They made two surprising announcements. Their long-awaited version 5 won’t be released until perhaps early 2026 (18 months later than many were predicting). And further, version 5 won’t<a id="idTextAnchor014"/> possess artificial general intelligence (AGI). That means it will be specialized. It won’t be capable of performing a wide variety of tasks as well as or better than the best humans. Currently, narrowly focused AI can beat us at specific tasks such as disease diagnosis, chess, or Go (which is far more difficult than chess). But an AGI would perform <i class="fm-italics">all</i> intellectual tasks at human level or above. <a id="idIndexMarker017"/></p>
<p class="list">Why did OpenAI slow things down? One possibility is that they caught their AI acting autonomously. Or it was getting spooky—showing signs of cunning, consciousness, deception, or independence. Perhaps they decided that they needed 18 months to ensure that it would remain under human control. Keeping AI united with human values and goals is known as the <i class="fm-italics">alignment problem</i>. And several people, even some employees, have been criticizing OpenAI for not paying enough attention to the dangers that AGI poses to the welfare of humanity.<a id="idIndexMarker018"/></p>

Claude writes and debugs computer programs very well. Claude is also known for its ability to read and write large quantities of text, but others are catching up. Claude focuses on “safety,” which means it’s cautious and won’t answer some questions other AIs are happy to answer. For example, Claude won’t recommend stocks. Claude also has a Projects feature, which, similar to OpenAI’s Custom GPTs, allows you to feed your custom data (documents describing your site’s purpose, Q&amp;A, or anything else) to a specialized AI all your own. Claude can be a bit prim. <a id="idIndexMarker019"/></p>

<p class="fm-sidebar-title">Making Perplexity your default searcher</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">I’ve changed the default search engine in my Chrome browser from Google to Perplexity. It’s superior to Google in several ways right now: you get direct answers (not a set of links you need to visit to find the answer to your query). You also get a standardized, stable interface instead of visiting random interfaces in the sites Google links to—with their popup ads and varying UIs. Perplexity has extra features (PDFs, generating images, attaching text, etc.) and no “sponsored” results. It provides you with the format and content you’re after rather than Google’s more generic answers. It also takes several steps to access and verify its responses.<a id="marker-9"/><a id="idIndexMarker022"/></p>

<p class="body">GPT consistently leads the pack of other AIs in most ways. Why is it usually able to announce breakthroughs first, only to be followed months later by the other AIs from behemoths such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Meta with their vast resources? Some believe that GPT remains ahead of the competition primarily because the others train themselves at least in part on code, papers, and technical details that GPT releases about its systems. And Microsoft and Apple have also made deals with OpenAI, GPT’s parent company, to use GPT in their AI offerings.</p>
<p class="body">The next big goal for these AI systems is <i class="fm-italics">agency</i>. What does that mean?

<p class="body">Note that throughout the book, I’ve employed AI to help with my research and provide feedback on my writing—including suggestions about things such as clarity, redundancy, tone, style, and voice—much the same as traditional human editors do. That said, all the writing in the book is mine, not AI’s. <a id="idIndexMarker030"/></p>
<p class="body">My prompts to AI are indicated by an RM icon in the margin. Content generated by the various AIs’ is indicated by the icon of the AI that is responding.</p>
<p class="body">Using AI for brainstorming is one of its most powerful features. You can get expert advice and really creative suggestions. Pose a question, and then have a conversation or ask for a list you can choose from.</p>
<p class="body">As you’ll see shortly, one useful approach is to tell AI to pause after each of its responses and wait for you to reply. This creates a natural dialogue between the two of you. It’s kind of like the game of 20 questions, but AI doesn’t need anywhere near 20 questions to give you excellent results. Let’s take a look at some of the best ways to interact with AI systems.<a id="idIndexMarker031"/><a id="marker-12"/></p>
<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_12">1.5 Mastering AI prompting</h2>
<p class="body">The foundation of most good prompts includes four elements: role, job, context, and format. And for each one, the more specific you are, the better. In this section we’ll explore these four elements in a bit more depth, consider how to use them together, and look at a few other concepts behind mastering the art of AI prompting.<a id="idIndexMarker032"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_13">1.5.1 Role</h3>
<p class="body">AIs are quite skilled at simulating things including types of people. You’ll usually get a superior response if you tell an AI its personality or expertise or both: <a id="idIndexMarker033"/></p>

<p class="body">Right from the start, give AI a role, like lawyer or art critic. Begin a prompt with variations on “you are a skilled mechanic” or “act as a master cake decorator.” AI sometimes demurs, saying that it’s not a lawyer or that, as an AI, it doesn’t have personal opinions. But often it follows that reluctance with a good answer anyway. (You can also slightly rephrase your prompt to get it to answer, if need be.)</p>
<p class="body">Giving AI a role seems to affect the result in two ways. First, the response can be more trustworthy because it’s drawn from experts. And second, the diction and idioms fit the role you gave it. For example, “you are a truck driver” can result in “go double nickel here and you’ll get a bumper sticker,” which, when translated, means “do 55 and you’ll get tailgated.”</p>
<p class="body">You can even tell AI that it’s a particular character or person:</p>

<p class="body">If you want a response of superior precision, where the sentences are as clear as a country stream, just tell AI that it’s Cardinal Newman or Hemingway.</p>
<p class="body">You also have the option to describe the tone of voice—conversational, formal, legalistic, whatever. (This might not be necessary if the role you gave it determines the writing style.) A variation on this is specifying your intended audience—children, art students, soldiers, a congregation. A good way to get a simpler, clearer description of a complex topic is to prompt like this:</p>

<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">TIP</span> Currently, AI isn’t great at accurate word count because it works with <i class="fm-italics">tokens</i>. These are units of text, but not necessarily words. Tokens don’t map 1:1 to words. For example, a punctuation mark is a token. The term <i class="fm-italics">ice cream</i> is only one token. So, if there’s a lot of punctuation, AI responds with fewer words than you requ<a id="idTextAnchor016"/>ested, or if there are several multi-word tokens, you’ll get more words. Claude, when asked, defends its refusal to give you a response with the exact word count you asked for because “Metrics like coherence, relevance, factual accuracy are prioritized instead.” In other words, it prefers to offer quality rather than quantity. Fair enough.<a id="idIndexMarker038"/> By the way, how many tokens do you think AI systems are being trained on? It’s difficult to get this data, but several sources say that Meta’s largest LlaMA model was trained on 1.4 trillion. That benchmark has undoubtedly grown higher by the time you read this book.</p>

<p class="fm-sidebar-title">Google vs. AI</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">Most AIs seem to prefer prompts that are complete sentences, or at least descriptive phrases, as if you were in conversation with a human. This is unlike how most people use Google, where they usually just type in a few keywords.</p>
<p class="fm-sidebar-text">To oversimplify a bit: AI systems can have a conversation with you and clearly understand the context and your preferences (if you remember to provide them). Google just matches keywords without nuanced comprehension. Google gives you a list of links you can visit where your keywords match its database, so <i class="fm-italics">you</i> can search for answers; AI gives you actual <i class="fm-italics">answers.</i> However, Google and Edge are rapidly infusing AI into their search engines, so you can expect improvements in those systems as well.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_19">1.5.7 How many words?</h3>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-18"/>There’s no consensus on prompt length. Google says 21 words is just about right when prompting its Gemini AI system. Too many words and Gemini can get confused; too few and its response will probably not address your specific needs. Other AI systems don’t specify an ideal word count. They say the number of words should be determined by the task at hand.<a id="idIndexMarker041"/></p>
<p class="body">Some experienced prompt engineers recommend short prompts on the theory that too much information confuses the AI, and it forgets or overlooks things nearer the end of a long prompt. Other engineers claim that you need to provide a lengthy, detailed prompt. Yet others say to create a long description of your request but break it up into several consecutive prompts. I’m confident that as AIs improve, you’ll soon be able to ignore this metric. They’ll be able to handle prompts of any length just fine.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_20">1.5.8 AI itself can improve your prompts</h3>

<p class="body">Just when we thought CoT required a human prompt, AI takes over that job too. Prompting GPT o1 might require a different approach now. You might want to ask GPT what kind of prompt works best, now that GPT is capable of its own CoT process and can create intermediate steps when reasoning.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_24">1.5.12 From the horse’s mouth</h3>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-21"/>OpenAI (parent company of Chat GPT-4o and DALL-E) provides an excellent tutorial on how to write the most accurate, most effective prompts for GPT in particular. To read it, go to <a class="url" href="https://help.openai.com">https://help.openai.com</a>, and then search for <code class="fm-code-in-text">prompt</code>. <a id="idIndexMarker049"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_25">1.5.13 Can AI auto-prompt itself?</h3>
<p class="body">It was bound to happen. Lately people have been studying prompt engineering (like we did in the previous sections of this chapter). That’s a useful skill for now, but perhaps not for much longer.<a id="idIndexMarker050"/></p>
<p class="body">Let’s face facts: AI will soon write prompts superior to those we can think up. First, it knows lots of things that we don’t know. Its memory is the size of the internet and contains most recorded human knowledge. (That’s why it’s already far better, for example, than most doctors at things such as reading X-rays and making diagnoses.) And second, AI knows itself better than we do. So, it understands how to write prompts that can get the best results.</p>
<p class="body">So how does auto-prompting work? Let’s try it out.</p>
<p class="body">You type in a prompt idea, and Claude will flesh it out for you into an improved, well-engineered prompt. Claude creates good prompts and then submits the prompt to itself so you can test it right then.</p>
<p class="body">To try it out, go to <a class="url" href="https://console.anthropic.com/">https://console.anthropic.com/</a>. Sign up or sign in. Then, click the Generate a Prompt button.</p>
<p class="body">You can provide short prompts (for example, “Write an email”), and then use Claude’s Edit feature to redo or modify the long prompt it generates if need be.</p>
<p class="body">I wanted AI to edit my writing to give me some inspiration about simplifying my paragraphs and making them beautiful. I wouldn’t copy and paste AI’s revision. I’d just get some good suggestions, particularly in matters of diction. So, I asked Claude this:</p>

During a famous experiment in 2023, GPT tricked a human into solving one of those “Are you human?” CAPTCHA puzzle tests.

<h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_28">1.6 A 13-step program: Creating a great website with WordPress</h2>
<p class="body">People creating and maintaining WordPress sites face 13 major tasks. This book’s chapters cover them in the order they are usually encountered while building a website. So let’s take a look at the typical steps people take while constructing a good site. The diagram in figure 1.4 illustrates the site-building steps.<a id="marker-26"/><a id="idIndexMarker057"/><a id="idIndexMarker058"/></p>

</div>
<p class="body">After this big picture view of the process, let’s then run through each of these steps in a little more detail.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_29">1.6.1 Choosing the best hosting service</h3>
<p class="body">Before actually working on your site, you need to take several important steps. Locate and sign up with the best possible hosting service. You’ll work on WordPress in the cloud, and your site will be stored and secured on your host’s servers. WordPress itself is fr<a id="idTextAnchor022"/>ee to use as it’s open source. <a id="idIndexMarker059"/><a id="idIndexMarker060"/><a id="idIndexMarker061"/></p>
<p class="body">The best hosts are DreamHost, Bluehost, and SiteGround. These are the three recommended by WordPress itself. Even experienced site developers run into problems, and a host with excellent tech support—fast and accurate—is, for most of us, essential.</p>
<p class="body">Although difficult, it’s possible to host a site on your own hard drive. However, you’ll want to use the utilities, security, speedy page load time, tech support, and many other features supplied by a hosting service. They can be quite reasonable, and they make building, maintaining, and protecting your site <i class="fm-italics">much</i> easier.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_30">1.6.2 Preplanning</h3>
<p class="body"><a id="marker-27"/>A website should be organic—it should be well-focused and <i class="fm-italics">coherent</i>. If you decide to wing it, to improvise as you go along, it’s all too easy to randomly tack things on. The result can be a patchwork, a disjointed collection of features and designs that don’t really work together to result in a clear overall purpose and context. Transitions between the pages can seem jarring. Site navigation can be inefficient and design can look motley. In this book, we’ll look at several ways to ensure cohesion and consistency right from the beginning of site construction.<a id="idIndexMarker062"/><a id="idIndexMarker063"/></p>
<p class="body">It seems illogical, but a site with a narrowly focused topic almost always attracts and retains a larger audience. People planning their site topic often mistakenly think that a lot more visitors would be attracted to a general topic like <i class="fm-italics">fishing</i>, for example. But unless you’re a celebrity fisherman, a topic that generic can easily sink your online efforts into oblivion. The reason is simple, if counterintuitive: competition. Search Google for “fishing,” and you get more than 3 billion results. Google “fly fishing in the Oconaluftee river” reduces your competition to zero or only a few.</p>
<p class="body">The only unfocused websites that tend to succeed are about celebrities, who thus have a built-in audience already. And that audience is interested in a whole variety of topics relating to the celebrity’s travels and other activities.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_31">1.6.3 Setting up the site structure</h3>
<p class="body">Most people are very surprised when they find out that you can, in a few hours, set up all the pages and subpages on your site! It’s only a matter of clicking an Add New button and typing in the page title to fill the site with empty placeholder pages. Later on, you’ll fill them with text and media content. But creating your overall site structure is surprisingly fast and simple.<a id="idIndexMarker064"/><a id="marker-28"/><a id="idIndexMarker065"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_32">1.6.4 Writing in a conversational style</h3>
<p class="body">Most website content is written in a relaxed, inviting style. Unless the content is academic, legal, or for some other audience that expects formal writing, you should aim for a conversational tone. Write as if you were talking with a friend. Chapter 4 shows you how to use AI to rewrite your text content in various styles.<a id="idIndexMarker066"/><a id="idIndexMarker067"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_33">1.6.5 Choosing the right plugins</h3>
<p class="body"><i class="fm-italics">Plugins</i> add functionality to a WordPress site. Do you need a button users can click to translate your site into another language? Would you like to display your artwork in an animated slideshow? Does your site’s blog need to be protected from spam? There are about 60,000 plugins, which is both good and bad. You’ve got lots of options, but you want to learn how to pick the best ones. <a id="idIndexMarker068"/><a id="idIndexMarker069"/><a id="idIndexMarker070"/></p>
<p class="body">The good part is you can find quite a few excellent plugins to choose from, and many are even free. The bad part is that no plugin developer has time to test their plugin for compatibility with the other 59,000. If you notice some odd behaviors (bugs), take a look at your plugins first. Plugin side effects are the single most common cause of bugs in WordPress. That said, most plugins, especially the very popular ones, play well together.</p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">DEFINITION</span> A <i class="fm-italics">plugin</i> is a software component that adds some specific functionality to a site. Examples include an events calendar, a contact form, social media integration, speeding up page loads, and a spam blocker, among others. Plugins are similar to cellphone apps—they are free or paid, can add functionality, and can be easily installed or removed at will.<a id="idIndexMarker071"/></p>
<p class="fm-callout"><span class="fm-callout-head">DEFINITION</span> A <i class="fm-italics">side effect</i> is essentially a bug—some weird behavior like something that should be visible on a page but isn’t. Or, you see an error message. Bugs can cause crashes, freezes, incorrect display of information, or other unexpected behaviors. If you have a bug in WordPress, the first step in debugging is to temporarily deactivate all of your plugins (it’s easy to do) and then reactivate them one by one. When the bug reappears, the plugin you just reactivated is the culprit. Uninstall it, and find an alternative plugin. With tens of thousands of available plugins, you won’t have any problem finding a good substitute. Google “best WordPress contact form plugins,” or ask an AI. Given the wide choice of quality plugins available, there’s little reason to waste time trying to figure out why one of yours is causing problems.<a id="idIndexMarker072"/></p>
<p class="body">In this book, we’ll explore how to choose reliable plugins that are unlikely to be abandoned by their creator, play well with others, and are kept up-to-date so they don’t introduce security vulnerabilities. One good strategy is to choose popular plugins that are marketed in two tiers—a free and a paid version. These <i class="fm-italics">freemium</i> plugins provide an income stream for their developers and are thus probably going to be kept current.<a id="idIndexMarker073"/></p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_34">1.6.6 Site design basics</h3>
<p class="body">Where plugins add features to a site, themes add professional design. Many design elements won’t be consciously noticed by most of your visitors. Colors, layout, typefaces, and so on are all below most people’s radar. But that doesn’t mean that people aren’t affected by design—quite the opposite!<a id="idIndexMarker074"/><a id="idIndexMarker075"/><a id="idIndexMarker076"/><a id="marker-29"/></p>
<p class="body">AI can provide you with surprisingly useful critiques and suggestions about all things related to design. You provide it with screenshots of your pages and it will give you great advice. Or tell it you’re planning a website featuring Instant Pot recipes, and it will give you the perfect color scheme and several home page designs from which you choose.</p>
<p class="body">A poorly designed site can annoy, upset, sadden, scare, confuse, or otherwise disturb your visitors in many ways. So because most of us don’t know color theory or typeface variations, professional designers take these and other factors into account and create themes that look good.</p>
<p class="body">When you first install WordPress, it comes with a default theme created by WordPress itself and named after the current year: Twenty Twenty, Twenty Twenty-Four, and so on. However, you can install a different theme if you wish. Some themes are free, and some aren’t. But as with plugins, choosing a freemium theme can prevent problems like poor support or abandonment. So you likely won’t be forced to switch to a new theme down the road. Having to switch can be problematic, especially if your site grows large.</p>
<p class="body">Themes also include options that let you customize the default site design—various typeface choices, color options, replacing the header image, and so on. These customizations are located in your Appearance &gt; Customize screen. And, as you’ll see in chapters 6 and 7, AI can help you polish your site’s design in many ways.</p>
<p class="body">Although too often overlooked by site builders, appearance is important. You want your audience to feel comfortable, even if they can’t explain why they are. There’s a reason that you don’t see the color red, or paintings of bullfights for that matter, in a doctor’s office.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_35">1.6.7 Advanced design</h3>
<p class="body">The best themes become popular, and that’s a bit of a drawback. You don’t want your site to look like a clone of other sites. It should look good, but in its own way. If your site sells things, you want to choose a design that promotes what you’re marketing. If you’re offering a site about gardening, how can you use photos and videos to best advantage? In other words, after you’ve chosen a theme, customize it. What does your particular audience expect to see? In what ways can you make the site look unique and in service of the site’s goal?<a id="idIndexMarker077"/><a id="idIndexMarker078"/><a id="idIndexMarker079"/><a id="marker-30"/></p>
<p class="body">Finally, if design isn’t your thing. If you don’t feel confident about modifying your site’s look, no problem. You likely have a friend who knows their way around design. Opposites attract. And, as always, AI knows all about the history of design, as well as fully understanding contemporary trends.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_36">1.6.8 Fine-tuning design the easy way</h3>
<p class="body">Cascading style sheets (CSS) is a computer language that allows you to polish the appearance of a site by overruling the theme’s style defaults. In this way, you can fine-tune your site’s design, so it looks more harmonic with your topic and also looks more unique.<a id="idIndexMarker080"/><a id="idIndexMarker081"/><a id="idIndexMarker082"/><a id="idIndexMarker083"/></p>
<p class="body">For example, if your theme’s body text is Garamond by default, you can use CSS to override that theme default and display your paragraphs in Roboto or Verdana. You gain pretty much complete control of all things visual on your site. You can even make all the text in the site blue, change the font style on a single page, or display a single word in Roboto and leave all the other text in Garamond. In other words, you can modify and polish your site in highly specific, granular ways. This frees you from any design constraints imposed by the theme.</p>
<p class="body">Although CSS <i class="fm-italics">is</i> a computer l<a id="idTextAnchor023"/>anguage, you don’t need to learn it. There’s an excellent WordPress plugin, YellowPencil, that generates CSS elements for you in a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) user interface. You move sliders to accomplish things such as resizing or repositioning a photo on a page. You can click in a color palette to change colors, choose a new typeface by selecting from a dropdown list, and make many other customizations. In this visual way, you can easily modify and improve the appearance of your site without having to write a single line of code. YellowPencil knows what CSS code is required to achieve the results you’re after.<a id="idIndexMarker084"/><a id="idIndexMarker085"/></p>
<p class="body">In addition to YellowPencil, there <a id="idTextAnchor024"/>are a few other quality CSS code-generator plugins you might want to look at, CSS Hero in particular. But in chapter 7, we’ll spend a lot of time learning to use YellowPencil. It’s the most popular. And you’ll also see how to get great computer code from AI systems.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_37">1.6.9 Managing media</h3>
<p class="body">One of the important benefits of online communication is that you can add various kinds of media. A site can be improved with the following additions:<a id="idIndexMarker086"/><a id="idIndexMarker087"/><a id="idIndexMarker088"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Images</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Audio</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Video</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Documents such as PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and so on</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Interactive elements such as rotating image galleries and Google maps</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Social media content</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Animation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">A frequent mistake in web design is the overuse or misuse of media. Contemporary site design calls for moderate, gentle animation; images that contribute to the site’s purpose (rather than serve as mere decoration.) Also, it’s considered rude to have audio and video start playing automatically all by themselves. The visitor turns them on if they wish to hear or see them. We’ll cover all the bases related to the effective, contemporary use of online media in chapter 8.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_38">1.6.10 Setting up a blog page</h3>
<p class="body">A blog is a special, unique page on a website that contains messages (called <i class="fm-italics">posts</i>), usually displayed in reverse-chronological order. The blog page can be a way to interact with your audience, a way to post the latest news on your site’s topic, or a customer-service feature that answers questions. Many blogs don’t permit comments from the audience because it can become time-consuming to vet all the incoming messages. But we’ll look at ways to automate the approval process. For example, you can make a list of forbidden words (“dumb”, “s***”, “hate”, etc.). If a message arrives at your site containing any of these words, it gets automatically thrown in the trash, never to be published in your blog.<a id="marker-31"/></p>
<p class="body">To retain an audience, a blog should be frequently updated with new content, either text or media.<a id="idIndexMarker089"/><a id="idIndexMarker090"/><a id="idIndexMarker091"/><a id="idIndexMarker092"/></p>
<p class="body">Although most blogs are primarily textual, some are focused on art (<i class="fm-italics">artlog</i>), videos (<i class="fm-italics">vlog</i>), or music. <i class="fm-italics">Microblogging</i> is another type of blogging featuring very short posts, à la X (formerly known as Twitter).<a id="idIndexMarker093"/><a id="idIndexMarker094"/><a id="idIndexMarker095"/></p>
<p class="body">Over the years, however, it’s become evident that there are several ways to mess up a blog and drive visitors away—or fail to attract them in the first place. In chapter 9, you’ll see how to build and manage a blog that contributes to, not works against, achieving your goals for your site.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_39">1.6.11 Making money</h3>
<p class="body">Chapter 10 is all about monetization. Websites can be a source of income in a variety of ways, including the following:<a id="idIndexMarker096"/><a id="idIndexMarker097"/><a id="idIndexMarker098"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Placing pay-per-click ads (links) on your site. When someone clicks a link that takes them to a page on Amazon’s (or another merchant’s) site, you earn a commission.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Using affiliate marketing earns you a commission if someone <i class="fm-italics">actually buys something</i> after clicking the link on your site th<a id="idTextAnchor025"/>at takes them to a product.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Selling your own products through an e-commerce plugin such as WooCommerce.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Getting paid for reviews or other content about a product. This is similar to owning a billboard that businesses rent.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Walling off a premium area within your site that people must pay to subscribe to before they’re allowed in to see the content.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Providing a service such as consultation, site design, or marketing.</p>
</li>
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
<p class="list">Fundraising by adding a donation plugin such as the Easy PayPal Donation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">These approaches aren’t mutually exclusive; you can combine them. But monetization must be handled with care, or you can annoy and shrink your audience. Ensure that you don’t load your site with popup or slide-in animated ads or use sketchy tactics like getting paid for positive reviews.</p>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_40">1.6.12 Optimizing your site for AI and search engine ranking</h3>
<p class="body">To attract an audience, you want to rank high in search engines and now AI systems. After typing in what they’re looking for, people don’t often go drilling five down in Google’s list of links past the first page. <a id="idIndexMarker099"/><a id="idIndexMarker100"/><a id="idIndexMarker101"/><a id="marker-32"/><a id="idIndexMarker102"/></p>
<p class="body">This is even more true of AI searches that often display only one or a few links (and sometimes none), not multiple pages of links. AI systems’ designers like to say that whereas Google gives you a list of sites you have to visit to search for the answer you’re looking for, AI, by contrast, gives you the answer itself.</p>
<p class="body">You want a link to your site to show up prominently when a potential visitor searches for your topic. This means you want to impress AI systems, Google, and Bing when one of their spider bots comes to visit you, judge you, and report back to the mothership.</p>
<p class="body">AI, Google, and other searchers have a list of things they don’t like at all! For example, if they find redundancy, ambiguity, or imprecision, they subtract points right then. So you, as your site’s administrator, need to pay attention to the quality of your content, site navigability, accuracy, keeping current, and overall excellence. In other words, because AI, Google, and others strive to provide the best possible search results, ensure that your site is convincingly the best possible answer to someone’s question or need. Don’t try gaming these systems. They know the tricks. Provide <i class="fm-italics">quality</i> instead.</p>
<p class="body">Achieving a high rank isn’t easy anymore, and paying attention to SEO is essential if you plan to grow an<a id="idTextAnchor026"/> audience (we’ll dive deep into SEO in chapter 11). And now, you also need to pay attention to AI optimization (AIO). Google, Bing, and other search systems are rapidly evolving to incorporate AI into their processes. The days of seeing a long list of links are over.<a id="idIndexMarker103"/></p>
<p class="body">Estimates state that more than 80% of people who go online use Google three times a day on average. Google and AI are the pathways to your site for most of your potential new visitors.</p>
<p class="body">In the early pre-Google days, search engines were rather crude. It was pretty easy to get a high rank. For example, you could be listed first in the results when someone searches for a classic car site if you just included the phrase <i class="fm-italics">classic cars</i> 400 times. And the closest runner-up site used the phrase less often.</p>
<p class="body">But then Google came along and changed the game. Google’s primary initial breakthrough (that went beyond multi-word, primitive, quantitative ranking algorithms) was to imitate the way that academic papers are ranked. The number of <i class="fm-italics">other</i> papers that cite your paper determines your rank. This is <i class="fm-italics">qualitative</i> judgment. The idea is that a paper must have importance and quality if it’s frequently cited by other scholars.</p>
<p class="body">Similarly, search systems look at how many other sites link to your site (called <i class="fm-italics">backlinks</i>). The systems also consider the quality of the sites that are backlinking to your site. Plus, Google and AI now make dozens of other kinds of judgments as well.<a id="idIndexMarker104"/></p>
<p class="body">Thanks to AI and deep data mining, today’s search systems are quite sophisticated. Some say that their critiques are now of sufficient quality to be equivalent to the judgments that expert human critics would make. Here are some strategies commonly used to please the searchers’ bots:</p>

</ul>
<h3 class="fm-head1" id="heading_id_41">1.6.13 Using analytics to build and keep your audience</h3>
<p class="body">Website <i class="fm-italics">analytics</i> means learning how to improve your site by understanding the behavior of your visitors and measuring the site’s overall performance. You can use analytic plugins to give you potentially valuable data on the following:<a id="idIndexMarker114"/><a id="idIndexMarker115"/><a id="marker-33"/><a id="idIndexMarker116"/></p>
<ul class="calibre5">
<li class="fm-list-bullet">
