    and learned that they are pretrained on vast amounts of text. Specifically, our
    focus was on decoder-only LLMs based on the transformer architecture, which underlies
    the models used in ChatGPT and other popular GPT-like LLMs.

    LLMs with millions to billions of parameters using a next-word prediction task
    yields models with impressive capabilities. These models can then be further finetuned
    to follow general instructions or perform specific target tasks. But before we
    can implement and train LLMs, we need to prepare the training dataset, as illustrated
    in figure 2.1.

    *embedding*. Using a specific neural network layer or another pretrained neural
    network model, we can embed different data types—for example, video, audio, and
    text, as illustrated in figure 2.2\. However, it’s important to note that different
    data formats require distinct embedding models. For example, an embedding model
    designed for text would not be suitable for embedding audio or video data.

    of converting raw data into a three-dimensional numerical vector.

    images, or even entire documents, to points in a continuous vector space—the primary
    purpose of embeddings is to convert nonnumeric data into a format that neural
    networks can process.

- en: While word embeddings are the most common form of text embedding, there are
    also embeddings for sentences, paragraphs, or whole documents. Sentence or paragraph
    embeddings are popular choices for *retrieval-augmented generation.* Retrieval-augmented
    generation combines generation (like producing text) with retrieval (like searching
    an external knowledge base) to pull relevant information when generating text,
    which is a technique that is beyond the scope of this book. Since our goal is
    to train GPT-like LLMs, which learn to generate text one word at a time, we will
    focus on word embeddings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Several algorithms and frameworks have been developed to generate word embeddings.
    One of the earlier and most popular examples is the *Word2Vec* approach. Word2Vec
    trained neural network architecture to generate word embeddings by predicting
    the context of a word given the target word or vice versa. The main idea behind
    Word2Vec is that words that appear in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.
    Consequently, when projected into two-dimensional word embeddings for visualization
    purposes, similar terms are clustered together, as shown in figure 2.3.

    scatterplot for visualization purposes as shown here. When using word embedding
    techniques, such as Word2Vec, words corresponding to similar concepts often appear
    close to each other in the embedding space. For instance, different types of birds
    appear closer to each other in the embedding space than in countries and cities.

- en: While we can use pretrained models such as Word2Vec to generate embeddings for
    machine learning models, LLMs commonly produce their own embeddings that are part
    of the input layer and are updated during training. The advantage of optimizing
    the embeddings as part of the LLM training instead of using Word2Vec is that the
    embeddings are optimized to the specific task and data at hand. We will implement
    such embedding layers later in this chapter. (LLMs can also create contextualized
    output embeddings, as we discuss in chapter 3.)
  prefs: []

- en: Unfortunately, high-dimensional embeddings present a challenge for visualization
    because our sensory perception and common graphical representations are inherently
    limited to three dimensions or fewer, which is why figure 2.3 shows two-dimensional
    embeddings in a two-dimensional scatterplot. However, when working with LLMs,
    we typically use embeddings with a much higher dimensionality. For both GPT-2
    and GPT-3, the embedding size (often referred to as the dimensionality of the
    model’s hidden states) varies based on the specific model variant and size. It
    is a tradeoff between performance and efficiency. The smallest GPT-2 models (117M
    and 125M parameters) use an embedding size of 768 dimensions to provide concrete
    examples. The largest GPT-3 model (175B parameters) uses an embedding size of
    12,288 dimensions.

    up into individual tokens. These tokens are then converted into token IDs using
    a vocabulary. The token IDs are converted into embedding vectors to which positional

    used as input for the main LLM layers.
