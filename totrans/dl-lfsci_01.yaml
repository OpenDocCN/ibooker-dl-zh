    a passion for data can pursue, few areas can match the fundamental impact of biomedical
    research. The advent of modern medicine has fundamentally changed the nature of
    human existence. Over the last 20 years, we have seen innovations that have transformed
    the lives of countless individuals. When it first appeared in 1981, HIV/AIDS was
    a largely fatal disease. Continued development of antiretroviral therapies has
    dramatically extended the life expectancy for patients in the developed world.
     Other diseases, such as hepatitis C, which was considered largely untreatable
    a decade ago, can now be cured. Advances in genetics are enabling the identification
    and, hopefully soon, the treatment of a wide array of diseases. Innovations in
    diagnostics and instrumentation have enabled physicians to specifically identify
    and target disease in the human body. Many of these breakthroughs have benefited
    from and will continue to be advanced by computational methods.

    The availability of robotics and miniaturized experiments has brought about dramatic
    increases in the amount of experimental data that can be generated. In the 1980s
    a biologist would perform a single experiment and generate a single result. This
    sort of data could typically be manipulated by hand with the possible assistance
    of a pocket calculator. If we fast-forward to today’s biology, we have instrumentation
    that is capable of generating millions of experimental data points in a day or
    two. Experiments like gene sequencing, which can generate huge datasets, have
    become inexpensive and routine.

    and how it can be applied in the life sciences. We begin with machine learning,
    which has been defined as “the science (and art) of programming computers so that
    they can learn from data.”^([1](ch01.xhtml#idm45806181338792))

    to deep learning. We begin with an example of how this type of machine learning
    can be used to perform a simple task like linear regression, and progress to more
    sophisticated models that are commonly used to solve real-world problems in the
    life sciences. Machine learning typically proceeds by initially splitting a dataset
    into a training set that is used to generate a model and a test set that is used
    to assess the performance of the model. In [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#introduction_to_deep_learning)
    we discuss some of the details surrounding the training and validation of predictive
    models. Once a model has been generated, its performance can typically be optimized
    by varying a number of characteristics known as *hyperparameters*. The chapter
    provides an overview of this process. Deep learning is not a single technique,
    but a set of related methods. [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#introduction_to_deep_learning)

    predicting the toxicity of molecules. In a second programming example, we show
    how DeepChem can be used to classify images, a common task in modern biology.

    of how machine learning can be applied to molecules. We begin by introducing molecules,
    the building blocks of everything around us. Although molecules can be considered
    analogous to building blocks, they are not rigid. Molecules are flexible and exhibit
    dynamic behavior. In order to characterize molecules using a computational method
    like deep learning, we need to find a way to represent molecules in a computer.
    These encodings can be thought of as similar to the way in which an image can
    be represented as a set of pixels. In the second half of [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#machine_learning_for_molecules),
    we describe a number of ways that molecules can be represented and how these representations

    possible. A key component of predicting the effects of drugs on the body is understanding
    their interactions with proteins. In order to understand these effects, we begin
    with an overview of how proteins are constructed and how protein structures differ.
    Proteins are entities whose 3D structure dictates their biological function. For
    a machine learning model to predict the impact of a drug molecule on a protein’s
    function, we need to represent that 3D structure in a form that can be processed
    by a machine learning program. In the second half of [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#biophysical_machine_learning),
    we explore a number of ways that protein structures can be represented. With this
    knowledge in hand, we then review another code example where we use deep learning

    have revealed that the interactions of DNA and RNA are much more complex than
    originally believed. In the second half of [Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml#deep_learning_for_genomics),

    to medical diagnosis. Medicine is incredibly complex, and no physician can personally
    embody all of the available medical knowledge. In an ideal situation, a machine
    learning model could digest the medical literature and aid medical professionals
    in making diagnoses. While we have yet to reach this point, a number of positive
    steps have been made. [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#deep_learning_for_medicine) begins
    with a history of machine learning methods for medical diagnosis and charts the
    transition from hand-encoded rules to statistical analysis of medical outcomes.
    As with many of the topics we’ve discussed, a key component is representing medical
    information in a format that can be processed by a machine learning program. In
    this chapter, we provide an introduction to electronic health records and some
    of the issues surrounding these records. In many cases, medical images can be
    very complex and the analysis and interpretation of these images can be difficult
    for even skilled human specialists. In these cases, deep learning can augment
    the skills of a human analyst by classifying images and identifying key features.
    [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#deep_learning_for_medicine) concludes with a number of
    examples of how deep learning is used to analyze medical images from a variety

    discovery efforts. Scientists use deep learning models to evaluate the interactions
    between drug molecules and proteins. These interactions can elicit a biological
    response that has a therapeutic impact on a patient. The models we’ve discussed
    so far are *discriminative models*. Given a set of characteristics of a molecule,
    the model generates a prediction of some property. These predictions require an
    input molecule, which may be derived from a large database of available molecules
    or may come from the imagination of a scientist. What if, rather than relying
    on what currently exists, or what we can imagine, we had a computer program that
    could “invent” new molecules? [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#generative_models) presents
    a type of deep learning program called a *generative model*. A generative model
    is initially trained on a set of existing molecules, then used to generate new
    molecules. The deep learning program that generates these molecules can also be
    influenced by other models that predict the activity of the new molecules.

- en: Up to now, we have discussed deep learning models as “black boxes.” We present
    the model with a set of input data and the model generates a prediction, with
    no explanation of how or why the prediction was generated. This type of prediction
    can be less than optimal in many situations. If we have a deep learning model
    for medical diagnosis, we often need to understand the reasoning behind the diagnosis.
    An explanation of the reasons for the diagnosis will provide a physician with
    more confidence in the prediction and may also influence treatment decisions.
    One historic drawback to deep learning has been the fact that the models, while
    often reliable, can be difficult to interpret. A number of techniques are currently
    being developed to enable users to better understand the factors that led to a
    prediction. [Chapter 10](ch10.xhtml#interpretation_of_deep_models) provides an
    overview of some of these techniques used to enable human understanding of model
    predictions. Another important aspect of predictive models is the accuracy of
    a model’s predictions. An understanding of a model’s accuracy can help us determine
    how much to rely on that model. Given that machine learning can be used to potentially
    make life-saving diagnoses, an understanding of model accuracy is critical. The
    final section of [Chapter 10](ch10.xhtml#interpretation_of_deep_models) provides
    an overview of some of the techniques that can be used to assess the accuracy
    of model predictions.

    a real-world case study using DeepChem. In this example, we use a technique called
    virtual screening to identify potential starting points for the discovery of new
    drugs. Drug discovery is a complex process that often begins with a technique
    known as *screening*. Screening is used to identify molecules that can be optimized
    to eventually generate drugs. Screening can be carried out experimentally, where
    millions of molecules are tested in miniaturized biological tests known as assays,
    or in a computer using virtual screening. In virtual screening, a set of known
    drugs or other biologically active molecules is used to train a machine learning
    model. This machine learning model is then used to predict the activity of a large
    set of molecules. Because of the speed of machine learning methods, hundreds of
    millions of molecules can typically be processed in a few days of computer time.
