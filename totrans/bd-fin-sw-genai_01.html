<p>The term “FinTech” became common in the last few decades as shorthand for financial technology. In fact, <em>financial technology</em> is a term that could be applied to inventions from long ago, such as the 19th-century cash register and telegraph, and even the earliest coin purses from circa 3,300 BCE. Today, FinTech helps empower crowdfunding opportunities through websites such as GoFundMe and Kickstarter. Gig service apps such as Uber and DoorDash rely on FinTech to facilitate fast payments. Payment services such as Venmo and Zelle can offer fast person-to-person (P2P) and business-to-business (B2B) payments thanks to FinTech. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are certainly classified as FinTech, but even the more traditional banking, investing, and credit companies have FinTech at their core.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p7">
<p>What is FinTech, then? Simply put, it is using technology to improve the handling of money. Today, FinTech refers to software that offers quicker, more convenient, and/or new ways to handle money. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p8">
<p>As you can see, a FinTech developer has the opportunity to work on many kinds of software. It should not be hard to imagine that the career paths open up for full stack FinTech developers, or those who can work on all aspects from frontend to backend. We are fond of saying that a full stack developer gets to be curious about many different areas. As a full stack developer, you will have opportunities to work on the different pieces that compose an application—from the user interface (UI) that customers will see down to the backend processing that fulfills requests from the UI and everything in between. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p9">
<p>Imagine receiving a reported problem about a customer interaction that is taking too long and ruining the user experience (UX). Where other developers will have to throw in the towel at one of their assigned boundaries, you will have the opportunity to trace that problem from the button click, through the application programming interface (API), to the server, and down to the specific Structured Query Language (SQL) statement to see how it can be addressed. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p10">
<p>This book will teach you about full stack development using a real-world FinTech project. The book aims to provide a high-level understanding of several aspects of software development encountered at FinTech companies, both large and small. After working through the project presented in the following chapters, you should have a better understanding of the areas of software development that interest you most and which topics you may want to dive deeper into. In much the same way that FinTech and full stack provide us with many different opportunities, we hope to present the reader with similar opportunities for learning both FinTech and software development. The varied topics should fire your imagination and encourage you to dive deeper into one or more topics.</p>

<h2 class="readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">1.1</span> The Futuristic FinTech project</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p12">
<p>This book will take you on a journey as a new software developer with a fictional FinTech company known as Futuristic FinTech. This means that it will be beneficial for you to have a little software development experience in a modern programming language, as we do not aim to teach you programming from the ground up. Instead, you should have a basic understanding of loops, if-statements, and similar. As this book does not focus on a single language or technology, newer developers should find much to learn about, while more seasoned developers should find some new tools or techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p13">
<p>To help you put your learning into practice, this book will take on a typical project for a large company such as Futuristic FinTech. This project addresses the need to modernize one of Futuristic FinTech’s numerous products. Products that need modernization are usually existing products that have been with the company for a long time. They are usually well established in their marketplace and used by many customers. The company may undertake modernizing these products for any number of reasons, such as</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p14">The company owns a product due to an acquisition or merger that does not meet the company’s existing design guidelines.</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p15">A product has come under renewed scrutiny because of new compliance or regulatory changes.</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p16">A product is being repositioned in its marketplace or marketed to a new audience.</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p17">A product requires expensive hardware or additional software to maintain it, and modernizing it will provide a more cost-effective solution.</li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p18">
<p>The project we are undertaking is the updating of a dashboard related to a payment system common for facilitating payment (such as paying a mortgage or car loan) and movement of funds (transferring money from a checking account to a higher-interest savings account at another institution) in the United States—the Automated Clearing House (ACH). </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p19">
<p>Our ACH dashboard project will require us to gain an understanding of ACH processing and full stack development as we tackle the aspects of database design, APIs, backend processing, and presenting everything within a UI. Along the way, we introduce different approaches and technology that we have worked with as FinTech developers ourselves. We will also explore how generative AI tools can make us more productive in our daily work, helping us to write, troubleshoot, and conduct many other tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p20">
<h2 class="readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">1.2</span> ACH dashboard</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p21">
<p>As mentioned, we will be building out an example payment system commonly used in US-based payments known as the ACH. However, the ACH system will often interact with equivalent systems in other countries such as</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p22">Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) in Canada</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p23">Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) in Europe</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p24">Bankers Automated Clearing System (BACS) in the United Kingdom</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p25">Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS) in Australia</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p26">National Automated Clearing House (NACH) in India</li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p27">
<p>ACH payments are a great way to get introduced to FinTech because they are a real-world example of how transactions flow between financial institutions. Once we have transactions flowing into a database, the world of FinTech will really open up to us. We will touch on many areas of software development and FinTech as we build out and then enhance our ACH dashboard, as shown in figure 1.1.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p28">
<p>Knowing the pieces that feed into the dashboard helps see the big picture. We can also take a look at how these pieces may come into play when loading an ACH file into the dashboard. Figure 1.2 gives us a high-level overview of the sequence of events that our dashboard will eventually execute once it is built out. Being able to load ACH files is the first step in interacting with the dashboard.</p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p30">
<p>Once we complete the ACH dashboard, we will take a look at all of the potential paths that are open to our project and hopefully find a fascinating direction to take the project in. While ACH likely affects us on a regular basis (is your payroll automatically deposited, or do you schedule credit card payments, mortgage payments, or other loans?), it is equally likely that you never heard of it before. Let us look at just how important the ACH is.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p31">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">1.2.1</span> How important is the ACH?</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p32">
<p>Figure 1.3 shows the trends in noncash payments in trillions of dollars between 2000 and 2021 as gathered by the latest Federal Reserve Payments Study (<a href="https://mng.bz/5g2z"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/mng.bz/5g2z</span></a>). Notice how ACH transfers have been dramatically increasing, taking a larger part of business, especially since the decline of checks.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p33">
<p>ACH is a dominant US standard, but there is a rise in the need for real-time payments. Earlier, we had mentioned P2P and B2B. There are other payment types as well, but the underlying idea is a quick real-time payment between two accounts. In response, ACH has developed the idea of same-day ACH, which can considerably speed up the time it takes to process an ACH payment, moving it from days to hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p34">

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p35">
<p>Real-time payments and their providers are positioning this standard as the next revolution in payments, and they are likely to gain some traction in the future. Real-time processing is set to be responsible for $10 billion per year by 2026, still a long way to go to affect the trillions of dollars processed by ACH every year. In either case, the lessons learned from this book will give us a handle on payment processing regardless of the technology being used. Now that we have an understanding of ACH, let us take a look at how we are going to accomplish building out this project, which will be done using an Agile methodology known as SAFe.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p36">
<h2 class="readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">1.3</span> SAFe Agile</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p37">
<p>According to the 17<span class="_Superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">th</span> Annual State of Agile Report, 71% of respondents use Agile in their software development lifecycle (SDLC) (see <a href="https://mng.bz/6e2y"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/mng.bz/6e2y</span></a>). This book draws on principles from SAFe Agile because we have direct experience with it at large Fortune 500 FinTech companies. Moreover, Scaled Agile (the creators of SAFe) states that over 20,000 organizations worldwide use the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe). </p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p39">
<p>As mentioned, even large FinTech companies that can traditionally lag in the adoption of technology have made the switch to Agile. The large fictitious FinTech company we joined known as Futuristic FinTech is no exception and has adopted SAFe as their approach to development. In the following chapters, as we build out our ACH project, we’ll try to adhere to some of the principles of the framework and Agile methodology in general. One of the key events in SAFe Agile is the Program Increment (PI) Planning Session, which helps plan out the work for the coming sprints.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text print-book-callout" id="p40">
<p><span class="print-book-callout-head">Definition</span> A program increment (PI) is a timebox (a set amount of time) that is anywhere from 8 to 12 weeks long. The PI usually consists of four iterations called “sprints”; that term is from Scrum and has been used by many different software tools (e.g., JIRA). A sprint is typically a two-week period but can be more or less, depending on what the teams decide.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p41">
<p>As part of the PI planning, the division displays a product roadmap for the coming year that shows various commitments the business has made, expected regulatory changes, and company initiatives. During this PI planning session, work will be broken up into epics. These epics are larger projects or initiatives. For instance, some companies may call their release an epic (such as the Spring 2024 release), and projects for the release are broken down into user stories. Still others may create their individual projects as epics and break down tasks for that project as user stories. Throughout the book, we try to work in short development cycles, and that is one of the main concepts of Agile as well. If we are breaking up the work into smaller manageable pieces, we should be okay, regardless of what we call those smaller chunks (of course, having some consistency helps with communication).</p>
</div>
<div class="callout-container sidebar-container">
<div class="readable-text" id="p42">
<h5 class="callout-container-h5 readable-text-h5">The Agile methodology</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p43">
<p>It should not come as a big surprise that every company is different. Many FinTech companies have their roots in Waterfall methodology but have moved to Agile recently. It is likely that we will encounter groups (divisions, business units, or teams) that follow Agile in different capacities—from the purists to those that have been dragged along kicking and screaming. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p44">
<p>Our aim is not to teach Agile per se, but rather to roughly work within the bounds of an Agile framework as we work through our project. If you want to dive into Agile more deeply, we encourage you to take a look at <em>Becoming Agile</em> (2009, Manning) by Greg Smith and Ahmed Sidky, and the Agile Manifesto (<a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"><span class="Hyperlink">https://agilemanifesto.org/</span></a>) is a required reading as well. But don’t worry: the manifesto is a quick read!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p45">
<p>The PI planning is about coming together as a group, and you will interact with business analysts, QA, developers, tech writers, and so forth to come up with a plan for the coming work. Figure 1.4 shows a PI planning board using a template found in Miro, a popular collaboration tool for just this type of activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p46">
<p>On the PI planning board, we should be able to find our team and assigned work. In our case, we have been assigned a project to create a new ACH dashboard as part of a companywide initiative to modernize legacy software. Typically, the PI planning session lasts for a day with the focus on prioritizing work, determining dependencies, and hammering out requirements that must be met. In addition, we identify risks using a ROAM (resolved, owned, accepted, mitigated) board and finally take a confidence vote where everyone uses a “fist-of-five” vote where they hold up their hand and vote (or via supported tools). If the average vote is a three or higher, the plan is committed, and we can get to work. If not, we review and rework the plan. Often, there are concerns about the amount of work, time to complete it, and any existing knowledge gaps. Working through these concerns is part of the process, and it can take some time. We are going to fast-forward through that and jump into the project that our team has been assigned since we can always find out more about SAFe and all its moving parts on their website (<a href="https://scaledagileframework.com/"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/scaledagileframework.com/</span></a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p48">
<p>Coming out of PI planning, we should have a promising idea of our project and the goals we are aiming for within the coming sprints. Our team has picked up the stories for modernizing the ACH dashboard. Modernizing legacy software can be tricky as not only must we deal with the technical challenges of design and development but also consider the effects of our changes on the customers as well. Some industries (and</p>

<p>individuals) can be notoriously slow to change. In the case of individuals, they know the current system, processes, and its idiosyncrasies. They have learned how to navigate the system to get their work done, so why change something that works? These are reasonable questions that we should consider for any project.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p51">
<p>In our case, the company has treated our ACH dashboard project, as a utility type task—a necessity for business but nothing more. However, since ACH is such a large part of how transactions are being processed by financial institutions, customers have begun asking for enhanced functionality for some time now. To maintain a competitive advantage, the business wants to modernize the dashboard. There is potential for better analytics of the transactions, fraud monitoring, as well as expanding the use of the dashboard to customers originating transactions. With these capabilities on the agenda, we need to look at providing a product that not only provides those capabilities but has a look and feel consistent with the rest of the products offered. Figure 1.5 shows an example of how the legacy interface currently looks.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p52">
<p>While the interface is functional, there is room for improvement. The business has reported the limitations that the team should work to address.</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p53">

<h5 class="figure-container-h5"><span class="">Figure 1.5</span><span class=""> </span><span class="">Legacy ACH Interface</span></h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p54">
<p>The current limitations of the legacy interface are as follows:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p55"><em>Unable to upload file</em><em>s</em>—Operations must currently ensure the files are uploaded, and then the back office can select them from the drop-down. This creates an unnecessary delay in processing.</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p56"><em>Rudimentary reportin</em><em>g</em>—Only file totals are reported. This method does not produce meaningful analytics. The system stores files in a legacy database that lends itself to reporting.</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p57"><em>Access limitatio</em><em>n</em>—The interface requires a connection to the backend server running on an IBM Power, while this system can run a webserver. Our SecOps team prefers to offload this task to a different server due to the extensive routing and firewall protection in place for this server.</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p58"><em>Stylin</em><em>g</em>—The new dashboard will eventually be marketed as a separate component in a wider system or to end-users that manage ACH files. The business wants existing style guidelines to be applied to the new project.</li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p59">
<p>The business has envisioned a modern website (figure 1.6) that will address these concerns and has assigned our team to work on this project.</p>

<h5 class="figure-container-h5">Figure 1.7 ACH dashboard initiative</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p63">
<p>The modernization initiative includes the following:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p64"><em>PostgreSQ</em><em>L</em>—Ensure a relational database is used and that ACH files are parsed into the database so that the Business Intelligence group can perform analytics on the data.</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p65"><em>Next.j</em><em>s</em>—Use a production-ready React framework such as Next.js. Ensure that the interface can support visualizations.</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p66"><em>Docke</em><em>r</em>—We want to ensure our application is split into components that are running in containers.</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p67"><em>Pytho</em><em>n</em>—Currently, our legacy applications, such as the ACH processing system, are written in COBOL. New projects should use Python as the primary language.</li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p68">
<p>It should be noted that we can substitute any of these components as we deem necessary (for the purposes of working on this project; on the job, chances are we will not have that luxury). That is something that we will bring up repeatedly in the following chapters. For instance, if you are more comfortable with MySQL or your company uses Java instead of Python and you would be better served by using those technologies, then, by all means, use them. You may have a tougher time reworking the examples from Python into Java (if you do not have experience in one or the other), but you will also learn a lot that way as well. Is there a technology you wish we had used instead? Feel free to reach out and let us know—perhaps we will tackle that next!</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p69">
<p>We would also like to note that the process of modernization is something that you will come across repeatedly in your career. It may be that all the Python/Java/Golang code in your company will need to be replaced by the next generation of languages at some point in your career. It may be that the company will hire a new chief technology officer who is more experienced in another technology stack and wants to move in that direction. Regardless of whether the decision is good or bad, we may be forced to endure the transition. Now that we have a bit more understanding of the project, let us take a look at some of the tools we will be using.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p70">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">1.4.1</span> Tools of the trade</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p71">
<p>As part of the ACH dashboard project, the team will be using the following tools. As in the previous section where suggested that readers may choose to replace Python with Java, or choose to use MySQL in place of Postgres— depending on their current technology stack—the same applies to these tools. If there are tools that are more suited to your current environment, please feel free to use those. Many of these tools will be discussed later, but we wanted to give you an idea of the toolset being used.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p72">
<p>The tools selected by our team are</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p73"><em>JetBrains PyChar</em><em>m</em>—Either the community or professional edition. We use the Professional edition and run our APIs, UI, and Docker from within it.</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p74"><em>JetBrains Webstor</em><em>m</em>—An additional tool for our UI development in Next.js. </li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p75"><em>Visual Studio Cod</em><em>e</em>—We use it for working with Docker and Plant UML, but it can also be in place of JetBrains PyCharm/Webstorm.</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p76"><em>JetBrains Qodan</em><em>a</em>—Used for code review.</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p77"><em>ChatGPT</em>—We chose it for coding assistance because there is a free version available for use to experiment with. Also, if our company cannot not provide an integrated experience, we can still use generative AI by accessing <a href="https://chat.openai.com/"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/chat.openai.com/</span></a>.</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p78"><em>GitHub Copilo</em><em>t</em>—It provides AI coding assistance for various IDEs. Having a subscription to GitHub Copilot will let us get assistance in PyCharm, Webstorm, and Visual Studio Code, to name just a few.</li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p79">
<p>We will also introduce various plugins that we use as well; however, we wanted to ensure that we set the playing field before we started to dive into the rest of the book. It is also possible to run the project using a single IDE. Personally, we tended to use JetBrains PyCharm Professional for all the development (Python, Next.js, and Docker) and that worked out great. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p80">
<p>Before we dive into the project, let us take a closer look at generative AI. This book is not a comprehensive book on generative AI. For that, you may want to look at <em>Introduction to Generative AI</em> (2024, Manning) by Numa Dhamani and Maggie Engler or <em>Generative AI in Action</em> (2024, Manning) by Amit Bahree. Instead, we will briefly introduce generative AI and some important concepts when working with it. Then, as we work through the project, we will show some specific cases where we found generative AI helpful (and some where it was a hindrance). </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p81">
<h2 class="readable-text-h2"><span class="num-string">1.5</span> A first look at generative AI</h2>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p82">
<p>In their last companywide meeting, Futuristic FinTech’s executive team expressed an interest in adopting generative AI tools to help drive efficiencies within the company. Several initiatives have been started in different company divisions to evaluate different tools and ways to incorporate generative AI. The ACH dashboard project can also use generative AI with the modernization project. The company has asked that we gain a better understanding of the capabilities, limitations, and liabilities of generative AI. So, what is one way we can think of generative AI?</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p83">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">1.5.1</span> A better rubber duck</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p84">
<p>We can think of generative AI as the next iteration of the rubber duck. Rubber duck debugging was popularized by the book <em>The Pragmatic Programmer </em>by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas (Addison-Wesley, 1999), and it provides a way of encouraging us to voice our thought process to a less intimidating audience than our boss or team lead! By speaking out loud to a rubber duck (or any inanimate object), we are often able to identify the problem before involving anyone else. We have often called over a co-worker only to point at the screen showing our captive audience how this piece of code could not possibly fail, only to see the immediate problem with our solid piece of code. Having a rubber duck to “bounce” ideas off is an invaluable resource (and quite cost-effective). If we are shy of speaking out loud (even when no one is around), some tools offer the ability to type out our thoughts. Slack has a channel that functions as a sounding board for our thoughts. Entering the channel will display “You can also talk to yourself here, but please bear in mind you’ll have to supply both sides of the conversation.” There is also a rubber duck chatbot service at <a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/cyberduck/"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/rubberduckdebugging.com/cyberduck/</span></a> and multiple generative AI rubber duck sites such as <a href="https://rubberducktherapy.app/"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/rubberducktherapy.app/</span></a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p85">
<p>We can look at generative AI as the evolution of that rubber duck. Generative AI allows our rubber duck to provide ideas and feedback instead of just a sounding board. We will still encourage the use of a rubber duck as well because it provides insight into our thought process and a cheap therapist when our day is long, and our code is uncooperative. </p>

<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p86">
<p>Generative AI is a subset of machine learning that powers tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. Generative AI can generate new content and is based on the use of large language models (LLMs). We see generative AI being quickly adopted into workflows in a variety of industries and roles, not just in technical areas but also in areas such as HR and marketing. Generative AI provides us with greater efficiency, which in turn saves time, and we all know time is money.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p87">
<p>In the next section, we put a FinTech spin on the old classic “Hello, World!” program with generative AI.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p88">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">1.5.2</span> Hello, Check 21!</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p89">
<p>“Well, where to begin?” we may think when we first see the ChatGPT prompt. We may want to get started with diving right in and seeing the kind of coding chops ChatGPT has, but let us first take a look at some other possibilities with ChatGPT. FinTech is filled with regulations that we need to be aware of, so we first ask it to “Please summarize the Check 21 regulation.” After reading the response, we find it to be a little dry as we are software developers, not business analysts. So, while we may need the details later on, we just want to get a general impression. We can try refining our prompt: “Summarize the benefits of Check 21 for the average bank customer.” This gives us something that may be a little more aligned with what we wanted to understand from the beginning. We could refine our prompt further: “Tell me about Check 21 in a couple of sentences,” and we again get a suitable response. One interesting thing to ask is “If we had to describe Check 21 in a single word, what would it be?” The response was “Digitalization,” which is actually a pretty good way to describe it.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p90">
<p>Of course, as software developers, we came here to code! Let us assume that we do not have any Python coding experience, but maybe we have knowledge of other languages and software development in general. We would like to see if ChatGPT can get us going with Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p91">
<p>Let us take the traditional “Hello, World!” program, but put a FinTech twist on it by instead printing “Current Balance: $1000.00.” With ChatGPT, we say, “In Python, show me the code to print a line that says ‘Current Balance: $1000.00’” and we get the associated code of print (“Current Balance: $1000.00”). It is important to note that the updates to ChatGPT and the fact that ChatGPT is not deterministic may cause the responses that we receive to vary. We may find that we enter the same prompt multiple times and receive different responses each time. So, if you are following along, it is okay if some of the responses vary slightly.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p92">
<p>As you can see, with Python, all we have to do is print a single line; we do not have the overhead of importing libraries or setting up main functions that we may find in Java or C. So, we decided to expand on that program a little bit by telling ChatGPT, “Expand the program to allow the user to enter the current balance amount that is then printed.” That also works as expected, giving us a simple program shown in the following listing.</p>

<p>Now, we really like the simple program we have written so far. However, when looking at the return value for <code>print_balance</code>, we see it is returning <code>None</code>. This makes sense since we are only calling a print statement within the code. However, to make the code even more maintainable, we can just return the formatted string and let the caller decide how they want to handle it. After all, this function should not decide how to handle the output as the caller may want to write it to a file or return it in an API call. We believe it is a good habit not to assume that the return value will always be handled the same way (in this case, printed). Often, we have had to rework large swaths of code because of an assumption that it would always be printed (in one of our cases, printed to an open network connection). The resulting business logic was so intertwined and the deadline so tight that we ended up copying the existing code and ripping out the print statements, so we could return what we needed. This resulted in technical debt (work that needed to be done in the future to address the duplicated code). Therefore, we want to return just the formatted string to get us into the habit of not assuming our function should be doing something specific with the output. So, we then tell ChatGPT to return a string instead of printing it, “Update the code so that <code>print_balance</code> will return the string and then print it.”</p>

<h5 class="callout-container-h5 readable-text-h5">Prompt engineering and problem formulation</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p102">
<p>Generative AI has led to a lot of buzz in the areas of prompt engineering and problem formulation. Somewhat ironically, these are not only subjects for generative AI but probably areas we should have been working on in our daily lives anyway! Prompt engineering is referred to as being able to craft meaningful input (prompts) for the LLM to decipher. After all, the model will need to be able to parse the prompt and form a response, so the input does matter because garbage in results in garbage out more often than not. Thus, prompt engineering focuses on </p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="readable-text" id="p103">Clear and specific prompts</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p104">Keeping prompts concise</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p105">Correct grammar and spelling</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p106">Using examples when appropriate</li>
</ul>
<div class="readable-text" id="p107">
<p>There is a notion that prompt engineering is not that important as models are continuously improving and becoming increasingly better at handling prompts. However, being able to clearly articulate our perspective and keeping it concise is a skill that most of us could benefit from. Have you ever just stopped reading a lengthy email? Yup, us too. While prompt engineering may be something that falls out of favor, there are many different approaches, some of which may currently be necessary depending on the problem you are working with. We recommend checking out various techniques defined at <a href="https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques"><span class="Hyperlink">https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques</span></a> or <span class="CharOverride-5">Generative AI in Action</span> by Amit Bahree (Manning, 2024).</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p108">
<p>Problem formulation refers to the ability to clearly define our problem. This is another skill that is obviously applicable to daily life, not just to our new generative AI overlords. Would we rather work with someone who asks for our help by saying, “This program is broken, and I sure didn’t do anything wrong!” or the co-worker who says, “I tried to speed up execution of this program for the DevOps group as part of ticket 123, and now the formatting is off”?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p109">
<p>While having generative AI write our code can be helpful, as new software developers, we will be fielding a lot of support-type work where we need to troubleshoot problems. Let us look at how generative AI may help us with debugging.</p>

<div class="readable-text" id="p110">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">1.5.3</span> Help! This code is not working!</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p111">
<p>Another benefit of generative AI is the ability to help us identify problems with code. This can be valuable for keeping our sanity or making us look like a hero to our co-workers. For example, let us say we have code that should keep a list of the last transactions a customer made so that we can easily retrieve them in our code. Probably not an unreasonable feature for most financial software. In the following listing, we defined a simple function that keeps a list of transactions.</p>

Another possibility is that something is happening that we are not anticipating. Keep that in mind because, on occasion, we will be staring at a part of the code we think is the problem, but we can’t figure it out. We may spend hours struggling only to find that both the problem and answer lie in another part of the code. We have some unit tests that go along with this problem as well, which are shown in the next listing.</p>

<p>So, if we wanted to take a break and look at fixing this for ourselves before moving on, we certainly could do that now. Then we can come back and see what ChatGPT <br/>gives us. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p118">
<p>Welcome back! Hopefully, we were able to give this a try to play around with the code a little bit, but let us jump right back in and enter this into ChatGPT. As we saw, the code from listing 1.5 has a logic flaw: we expect to see three transactions listed but only see two. We simply ask ChatGPT, “Why doesn’t this code work?” which we did on purpose just to disregard some of the prompt engineering and problem formulation that we discussed earlier. We wanted to see what type of response we would recieve, and it was a great response as ChatGPT identified two problems that it did not like with the code:</p>
</div>
<div class="callout-container sidebar-container prompt-response-sidebar">
<div class="readable-text" id="p119">
<p><strong class="response-head-image"><img alt="image" height="undefined" src="../Images/Response-Chatgpt.png" width="undefined"/></strong> The code you’ve provided is aimed at adding a new transaction to the user’s transaction list while ensuring that the length of the list doesn’t exceed the given “max.” If adding a new transaction would exceed the “max,” the oldest transaction is removed.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p120">
<p>However, there are a couple of problems:</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li class="readable-text" id="p121">The name “max” is a built-in Python function that returns the largest of the input values. It would be better to avoid using it as a variable name. Let’s change it to something like “max_length.”</li>
<li class="readable-text" id="p122">The condition for popping a transaction is “if len(user_transactions) + 1 &gt;= max:”. This means if you have “max_length = 3” and the current length of “user_transactions” is 2, it will remove the first transaction before adding the new one, thus always keeping the length as 2. This is incorrect. The correct condition should be “if len(user_transactions) + 1 &gt; max_length:”.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p123">
<p>As we can see, a couple of problems were pointed out: first, we used the name “max” in our code. Our IDE flagged this as well since <code>max</code> is a built-in Python function. As we saw earlier with this name shadowing, the code will still work but can become a bit more convoluted when trying to follow it. Second, the other suggestion was to update the if statement in the code to be <code>if</code> <code>len(user_transactions)</code> <code>+</code> <code>1</code> <code>&gt;</code> <code>max_length:</code>. With either of these solutions in place, we can rerun the code or rerun the tests to confirm that the code is working better.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p124">
<p>One thing we always find interesting is the number of solutions to any problem; sometimes we solve something only to go back later and say, “What were we thinking!?” We thought that ChatGPT would have just dropped the <code>+</code> <code>1</code> and kept the existing logic. If we found that puzzling, then we might ask ChatGPT about it. We followed up with “What if we were to change the line to <code>if len(user_transactions)</code> <code>&gt;= max_length:</code>?” and ChatGPT gave us some additional information but also confirmed that “this change will indeed make the code work correctly for the intended purpose!” We have the code and <code>pytests</code> confirming both ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p125">
<p>We cannot really provide insight into why ChatGPT chose one way over another, but we take this as confirmation that, again, generative AI is a tool that can be used but should not necessarily be taken as the end all be all. We tried to follow up with “Is there a performance benefit to one way versus the other?” and ChatGPT gave a reasonable answer. One thing we found interesting was that it started putting <code>if</code> <code>len(user_transactions)</code> <code>&gt;=</code> <code>max_length:</code> as its suggested change and favored it because it was intuitive and provided better readability. Either way, we hope that you will also see the usefulness in being able to get some feedback from generative AI tools to help us determine code flaws and potential enhancements.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p126">
<p>Sometimes it is not necessarily a code problem that we have but more of a “I am sure that you need to use an equal sign to assign a variable, but it is not working.” Generative AI can be of huge help when you know what you want to do but cannot quite remember how to do it in a particular language or environment. We look at how generative AI can help in the next section.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p127">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">1.5.4</span> Help! I forgot the syntax!</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p128">
<p>Another benefit of generative AI is just getting started with the syntax. Sometimes, as a full stack developer, constantly switching from one language to another can make us dizzy. We may find ourselves knowing what we want to accomplish but not being quite sure how to get there. As we saw with the first example, we can have our generative AI tools get started for us as long as we know how we want to go about the process. For instance, in our first example, we were able to define a function, pass parameters, and use type hints. If we are not aware of these constructs or are unwilling to learn about them, then it is unlikely that generative AI will be of much use to us.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p129">
<p>Let us try another example from full stack development. Previously, we were working with Python, but let’s switch gears and jump to the UI with HTML5 and D3.js. We like to use VS Code with the Live Server plugin when working with HTML and scripting. Everyone has varying levels of experience with HTML5 and D3.js, from never having heard of them to an expert. However, even if our experience is having seen a bar graph or used one on a website, we can work our way through this without too many problems. We can ask ChatGPT to “create a simple d3.js bar chart in an html5 page” and end up with something respectable but, by no means, award winning (figure 1.8).</p>

<p>That graph looks okay, but we want to add some labels to the axis. That should be something we have come across when seeing visualizations before and should not be that far of a jump for us to consider adding to the visualization. We can simply enter, “Can you update the code to add axis labels?” at the prompt, and we will see that labels were successfully added. Even though we may not be sure how to write the code, we know what we want the code to do, and that is enough to get us going in the right direction for this example. See the output with axis labels in figure 1.9.</p>

<p>This is looking pretty good now. We may not win any contests, but it certainly helps get the point across with our visualization. Now, we can see about adding a little interactivity when we hover the mouse over a bar. We enter “Can the code be updated to change the bar color and display the value for the bar when I hover with the mouse?” on the prompt, and we get an interactive graph. The bar changes color from blue to orange when we hover along with the value being displayed near the mouse. Playing around with this, we can see it works reasonably well, but one thing we are not happy with is that the tooltip with the value appears where the mouse enters the bar but doesn’t move with the mouse as it moves within the bar itself. We could fix this by updating the code to update the position when the mouse moves, or maybe we should just display the value above the bar when we hover, or perhaps just display the value above the bar all the time. Feel free to play around with some of these or implement other approaches!</p>

<p>The label does not appear quite centered, and when it is displayed over the largest bar, it goes off-screen. We could probably coerce ChatGPT into getting it just the way we want, or we could dive into the code and try to work through it. Either way, we should have been able to come up with a decent bar graph even if we have not used D3.js or are not familiar with HTML. These code snippets can also act as training tools for us to play around with the code to use and learn from. Maybe we aren’t sure how to use the <code>append</code> or <code>on</code> methods from d3.js, reviewing these samples or the generated code is a great way to see them in action. </p>

<h5 class="callout-container-h5 readable-text-h5">Verification</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p140">
<p>Since we just worked through some examples that we may not have been very familiar with, it is probably a good time to go over verification. We should never have tools such as ChatGPT write us a bunch of code that we could never understand. It can be beneficial to see how things are done, and we can even use it to generate code for ourselves (see the following sections for some additional insights on security/privacy/ownership concerns). But remember that sticking that code in and checking it means that we will own it. There have been many times where we have been asked about a code change that we made a decade ago because we were the last person to change that module. </p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p141">
<p>Here is a Perl one-liner generated from ChatGPT that validates an email address is formatted correctly. Feel free to insert it into your existing software solution—just be ready to own it in the middle of the night when the support staff calls you to say that the customer email import process is broken!</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p142">
<div class="code-area-container">
<pre class="code-area">perl -e 'my $email = "user@example.com"; if ($email =~ /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-<br/>]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/) { print "$email is a valid email address.\n"; } else { print "$email is an invalid email address.\n"; }'</pre>

</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p143">
<p>If you were unfamiliar with regular expressions and Perl, how likely would you be to put that in your code?</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p144">
<p>Another feature of tools such as ChatGPT is the ability to ask for references. Perhaps, after seeing the regular expression to validate an email, you decide that you may want to validate the results by doing a bit more research. By asking ChatGPT to provide sources for the code, it will refer you to the Perl documentation (<code>perldoc</code>). It will also refer to general regular expression knowledge, as well as the official standard for email addresses (RFC-5322). This can give us a good starting point when we want to learn a bit more about code we do not understand. </p>

<p>We see how powerful and helpful generative AI is, but in the next section we’ll take a look at a potential pitfall when using it.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p146">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">1.5.5</span> Did I just give away my data?</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p147">
<p>The next example of the benefits of generative AI is the ability to have it take input and process it for us. For example, let us say that a banker provides us with a report file, and they want some reporting done with it. They provide us with a comma-separated value (CSV) file and want us to total it up. Why they cannot do that in Excel is beyond us, but we figure it may be a good chance for us to get some additional Python practice and maybe try generative AI. We are provided some data formatted as</p>
</div>
<div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p148">
<div class="code-area-container">
<pre class="code-area">"ssn", "account", "balance"
"000-65-4320", 1, "$1.00"
"000-65-4321", 1, "$2.00"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p149">
<p>When we paste that data into the prompt, ChatGPT responds with “It looks like you’ve provided a list of Social Security Numbers (SSNs) paired with account numbers and corresponding balances. How can I assist you with this data?” which is a very nice response. Compare that response to one we may receive from your co-worker if you just threw a similar printout in front of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p150">
<p>So, at the prompt, we enter “Given this sample file, write a python program to print a report with totals” and paste in our data below the prompt. It prints the program from the following listing.</p>

lines = data.strip().split("\n")
total = 0.0

# Skip the header row

    balance_str = line.split(",")[2].strip().replace("$", "")
    total += float(balance_str)

print(f"Total Balance: ${total:.2f}")</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p152">
<p>The code looks reasonable, so we go ahead and run it. However, the code runs into a value error: <code>ValueError:</code> <code>could</code> <code>not</code> <code>convert</code> <code>string</code> <code>to</code> <code>float:</code> <code>'"1.00"'</code>. So, the code produced from ChatGPT contains an error. We can try to fix this on our own, or we can let ChatGPT know that it has a problem. Feel free to review and troubleshoot the error to see whether it can be fixed before moving on!</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p153">
<p>The problem turned out to be the quotes in the <code>balance_str</code>. To correct it, we can add an additional <code>replace</code> to handle the double quotes, so the line becomes <code>balance_str</code> <code>=</code> <code>line.split(",")[2].strip().replace('$',</code> <code>'').replace('"',</code> <code>'')</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p154">
<p>While this is potentially a very helpful way to use generative AI, there are some potential drawbacks. One is that we have just entered nonpublic information (NPI) into ChatGPT. If the tool we are using ingests the data for training, then potentially, we have exposed customer information to an insecure source, as it may show up in responses to other users. We must be very careful about the data that we enter into any tool, not just when using generative AI, as we want to be sure that the information is stored securely. In our case, any SSN starting with <code>000</code> is invalid, so we are not using real data.</p>
</div>
<div class="callout-container sidebar-container">
<div class="readable-text" id="p155">
<h5 class="callout-container-h5 readable-text-h5">Ownership</h5>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p156">
<p>We covered the potential concerns about entering secured data into generative AI, and we should also be aware of entering proprietary information into it as well. If our proprietary code is being used to train the system, it may not be proprietary for very long. Always look at the Terms of Service (ToS) and End-User License Agreement (EULA).</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p157">
<p>Another concern may be that of ownership of responses: if we ask the model to generate some code that goes into a product which we are selling, then who owns that code? Do we have to pay royalties to them? These types of questions/concerns are what we should keep in mind as we make the transition of student or developing for personal use versus developing in a corporate environment. Corporations can be very prickly about releasing sensitive data and rightfully so. Their business may depend on trade secrets, and there could be substantial fines for mishandling sensitive data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p158">
<p>Concerns about ownership lead us to similar concerns about privacy and security, which we discuss in the next section.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p159">
<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">1.5.6</span> Privacy and security</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p160">
<p>Other areas of generative AI that we need to be aware of—which will be a pervasive topic throughout our careers—are the areas of privacy and security. It may be possible that feeding our code into a generative AI tool is helping to train it, and our proprietary code could end up getting output as an answer to someone else’s prompt. Tools such as GitHub Copilot specifically state that they do not store or share our code. In that same aspect, we will need to be careful about sensitive information such as nonpublic information (NPI) or personally identifiable information (PII) that we input into the model as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p161">
<p>Maybe we want the generative AI tool to summarize the quarterly earnings report for each business unit, so we can create a compelling infographic and think that generative AI could make that helpful. Well now, we have just potentially shared corporate/trade secrets with the model! So, some care and thought should be given to what we enter the system. If using generative AI to troubleshoot problems as we did in the previous section, it may be beneficial to create a smaller code snippet that is more generalized but still suffers the same problem we are troubleshooting. Who knows, we may just figure out the problem in the process!</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p162">
<p>The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) has specific guidance on the adoption of generative AI at <a href="https://genai.owasp.org/"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/genai.owasp.org/</span></a>. It is interesting to review the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs and generative AI and see what type of exploits we may encounter. Knowing about the potential dangers will hopefully help us avoid them.</p>

<h3 class="readable-text-h3"><span class="num-string">1.5.7</span> Staying up to date</h3>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p164">
<p>One last concern might be how recent the data in the model is. If the model is based on older data, we may not get the results we intend. In the majority of cases, we have seen when asking tools such as ChatGPT for the latest version of Java or NPM, it is aware enough to qualify its response. In other cases, our question may indicate that it is a potential version problem. For instance, when asking ChatGPT “How<span class="CharOverride-7"> do I connect to PostgreSQL in Python?” it provides a reasonable example of using </span><code>psycopg2</code><span class="CharOverride-7">. However, there is a newer rewrite of </span><code>psycopg2</code><span class="CharOverride-7"> called </span><code>psycopg3</code><span class="CharOverride-7">. If we try to refine our example and ask ChatGPT to use </span><code>psycopg3</code><span class="CharOverride-7"> instead of </span><code>psycopg2</code><span class="CharOverride-7">, it again says that its data may be out of date:</span></p>

<div class="callout-container sidebar-container prompt-response-sidebar">
<div class="readable-text" id="p165">
<p><strong class="response-head-image"><img alt="image" height="undefined" src="../Images/Response-Chatgpt.png" width="undefined"/></strong> It seems like there might be a typo in your request. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there is no library called<span class="_Body-Char"> </span><code>psycopg3</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p166">
<p>Of course, if we were not aware of <code>psycopg2</code> or given instructions to use <code>psycopg3</code>, we may be thrown off course a little bit but not to worry. We might think that if there was confusion about whether our assignment was <code>psycopg2</code> or <code>psycopg3</code>, we could easily ask our co-workers. However, if we are new to the job and thrown into the deep end of the pool, we may be reluctant to ask our new mentor (who is undoubtedly very busy) to clarify such a simple oversight.</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p167">
<p>It is interesting to see that we can ask ChatGPT to treat <code>psycopg3</code> as a drop-in replacement for <code>psycopg2</code> by entering the following at the prompt<code>:</code> “<code>psycopg3</code> is a rewrite of <code>psycopg2</code>. Can you simply replace <code>psycopg2</code> with <code>psycopg3</code> in the given example?”</p>
</div>
<div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p168">
<p>Then, ChatGPT will again generate a reasonable response:</p>
</div>
<div class="callout-container sidebar-container prompt-response-sidebar">
<div class="readable-text" id="p169">
<p><strong class="response-head-image"><img alt="image" height="undefined" src="../Images/Response-Chatgpt.png" width="undefined"/></strong> I apologize for the confusion earlier. Since I don’t have information about <code>psycopg3</code> as of my last update in September 2021, I’ll assume its usage is similar to <code>psycopg2</code>. If <code>psycopg3</code> is indeed a rewrite of <code>psycopg2</code>, the usage should be quite similar.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="readable-text" id="p170">
<p>This is yet another aspect of verification that we must be aware of—if the tools are not up to date and giving us suggestions, there could be vulnerabilities to the particular version or various improvements that we might be missing out on. Again, generative AI is giving us a good starting point, but it is still up to us to do some due diligence to ensure everything is on the up and up.</p>
