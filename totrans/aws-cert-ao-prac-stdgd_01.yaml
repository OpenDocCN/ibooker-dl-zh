    it’s changing how we work across almost every field you can name: software, marketing,
    healthcare, finance, education, and beyond. What used to be the domain of data
    scientists and PhDs has gone mainstream. Today, if you understand how to use AI
    effectively, you’ve got an edge.'

    having a certification can make a real difference. It’s more than just a piece
    of paper. It’s proof that you know your stuff and can apply it where it matters.'
