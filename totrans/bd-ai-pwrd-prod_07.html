<h1><span class="label">Chapter 7. </span>AI Tools for <span class="keep-together">Product Managers </span></h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI PMs (AI product managers)" data-secondary="tools for" data-type="indexterm" id="icd701"/>was once asked whether AI will replace product managers. I responded by <a href="https://oreil.ly/y1MZZ">quoting</a> Harvard Business School<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Harvard Business School" data-type="indexterm" id="id1183"/> professor Dr. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Lakhani, Karim" data-type="indexterm" id="id1184"/>Karim Lakhani:<em> </em>“AI won’t replace humans—but humans with AI will replace humans without AI.” In this instance, product managers will not be replaced by AI; product managers who don’t leverage AI will be replaced by product managers who do.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In this chapter, I discuss the “AI-enhanced” type of AI PM and the AI tools that can enhance your craft if as one. A clarification: in recent conversations, I’ve noticed a common misconception—people often use the terms <em>AI product management</em> and <em>AI for product managers</em> interchangeably. While they might sound similar, these are two distinct concepts. Understanding the difference is crucial for grasping the broader landscape of AI’s role in product development.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>AI product management <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI PMs (AI product managers)" data-secondary="AI product management versus AI for product managers" data-type="indexterm" id="id1185"/></em>refers to the craft of creating AI products: products that are inherently powered by AI technologies. This role involves a deep collaboration with data scientists, ML engineers, designers, and other stakeholders to integrate AI into user experiences.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>AI for product managers</em>, on the other hand, refers to AI-enhanced PMs who can leverage AI to enhance their product management craft, whether they’re working on an AI product or focusing on another  (non-AI-powered product) area. These tools use AI to streamline various aspects of the product development lifecycle, such as sifting through vast amounts of market data to identify trends, or analyzing user feedback to highlight common pain points. This isn’t about building AI into your product; it’s about <em>using</em> AI to build a <span class="keep-together">better product.</span></p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Tools to Enhance the AIPDL" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="ch07_tools_to_enhance_the_aipdl_1736793248032589">&#13;
<h1>Tools to Enhance the AIPDL</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Before<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI PMs (AI product managers)" data-secondary="tools for" data-tertiary="AIPDL enhancement" data-type="indexterm" id="icd702"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AIPDL (AI Product Development Lifecycle)" data-secondary="tools for enhancing" data-type="indexterm" id="icd704"/> we dive in, I should tell you that while I’ve mapped these tools to the different stages of the AIPDL where they can best help you, the mapping in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch07_table_1_1736793248027419">Table 7-1</a> is just a guideline. Many of these tools are applicable in multiple stages of the AIPDL, and in some cases, the entire lifecycle. This framework is intended to give you a head start, but how you choose to leverage these tools will vary based on your workflow and evolving needs.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Additionally, each PM may have a completely different workflow, based on how they decide to incorporate AI into their work. These workflows evolve as new tools emerge and as advancements in AI provide new capabilities. Experimenting with different AI tools will allow you to craft a system that works best for <span class="keep-together">you—</span>and this system will likely change as you and the tools develop. While the following tools are among those that I recommend, there are others that I use throughout the AIPDL: for example, Google Gemini as a one-stop-shop tool and NotebookLM, which helps process large amounts of information and makes it more applicable to the use case I have in hand, i.e., adding as an input a two hour-long YouTube video and getting almost instantly the key points that are relevant to my work.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>One word of caution: when using third-party AI tools, it’s important to be mindful of the privacy and security<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="privacy" data-secondary="third-party AI tools" data-type="indexterm" id="id1186"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="security" data-secondary="third-party AI tools" data-type="indexterm" id="id1187"/> of any confidential information you’re sharing. Some of these tools might handle sensitive data, so it’s always a good idea to consult with your company’s privacy and legal teams to determine which tools are appropriate to use and which are not. Please note that the tooling landscape changes extremely fast.

<p>As <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI PMs (AI product managers)" data-secondary="tools for" data-startref="icd702" data-tertiary="AIPDL enhancement" data-type="indexterm" id="id1217"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AIPDL (AI Product Development Lifecycle)" data-secondary="tools for enhancing" data-startref="icd704" data-type="indexterm" id="id1218"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI PMs (AI product managers)" data-secondary="tools for" data-tertiary="collaboration and tracking" data-type="indexterm" id="icd703"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="collaboration" data-secondary="tools for" data-type="indexterm" id="icd705"/>discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#ch04_the_ai_pm_s_day_to_day_1736793247322408">Chapter 4</a>, maintaining close collaboration with your cross-functional teams and stakeholders is essential for ensuring alignment. To minimize risks and be set for success, it’s crucial to figure out ways to collaborate efficiently with your partners. Here are some tools I have used in the past that help streamline communication, task tracking, and milestone management across <em>all</em> stages of the AIPDL:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Aha!</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p><a href="https://www.aha.io">Aha!</a> is a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Aha!" data-type="indexterm" id="id1219"/>road map software tool designed for product and strategic planning. It enables product managers to outline the product vision, strategy, and timeline, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned on overarching goals. Aha! also offers scenario analysis, which allows you to plan for future challenges and explore alternative strategies, making it a powerful tool for navigating the uncertainty and complexity often inherent in AI product development.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Trello</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p><a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Trello" data-type="indexterm" id="id1220"/> known for its simple UI and flexible, visual dashboards. It helps teams track tasks and assignments through customizable boards, lists, and cards, making it easy to adapt to the changing needs of AI projects. Trello’s flexibility is particularly useful for AI PMs who need to manage multiple workflows and stakeholders, providing a clear overview of task progression and team responsibilities at every stage of development.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt class="pagebreak-before less_space">Jira</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/jira">Jira</a> is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Jira" data-type="indexterm" id="id1221"/>one of the most widely used project management tools in software development, particularly for managing large, complex projects. It is favored by engineering teams for tracking bugs, issues, and feature development, making it a great fit for AI PMs who need to coordinate closely with engineering. Jira’s robust reporting features provide detailed insights into project health, progress, and bottlenecks, making it a valuable tool for managing the intricate workflows involved in AI-driven products.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
	<dt>Productboard</dt>&#13;
	<dd>&#13;
	<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/prdbrd">Productboard</a> goes<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Productboard" data-type="indexterm" id="id1222"/> beyond standard project management by integrating user insights, competitive research, and feedback from multiple channels into one platform. This tool allows product managers to evaluate and prioritize features based on business impact and customer needs. Productboard’s impact scoring and timeline visualization capabilities help PMs make data-driven decisions while adjusting priorities in real time, ensuring that AI product development stays aligned with both user demands and business goals.</p>&#13;
	</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Each tool has its strengths, and your choice of which to use will depend on the specific needs of your product, organization, and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="AI PMs (AI product managers)" data-secondary="tools for" data-startref="icd703" data-tertiary="collaboration and tracking" data-type="indexterm" id="id1223"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="collaboration" data-secondary="tools for" data-startref="icd705" data-type="indexterm" id="id1224"/>team.</p>&#13;

<h1>Conclusion</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I’ve outlined how AI tools can empower product managers throughout the entire AIPDL, from ideation to rollout. These tools serve not only to streamline your workflows, but also to enhance decision making and drive strategic insights that would be impossible without AI. It’s not about building AI into your products exclusively, but about using AI to amplify your own capabilities as a product manager. As the landscape of AI tools evolves, your role in product development will continue to expand, and those who leverage these tools effectively will stay ahead in an increasingly competitive market.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Before moving forward, remember that your workflows are personal. The tools presented in this chapter are just a starting point. Your unique work style, your company’s structure, and the evolving nature of AI technology will continuously influence how you utilize these tools. And, as always, exercise caution when using third-party AI tools—always consult your company’s privacy and security teams to ensure compliance.</p>&#13;
