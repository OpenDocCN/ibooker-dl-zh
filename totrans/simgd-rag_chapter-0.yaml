- en: How machines understand human intent has always been a subject of deep interest
    for me. Although I embarked on my journey into AI and machine learning in 2007,
    it was in early 2016 that I became fascinated by natural language processing (NLP),
    while building a virtual data analyst. When Google released BERT in 2018, I became
    convinced that NLP was on the brink of a revolution.

  zh: 机器如何理解人类意图一直是我深感兴趣的主题。虽然我在2007年开始踏上AI和机器学习之旅，但直到2016年初，在构建一个虚拟数据分析师时，我对自然语言处理（NLP）产生了浓厚的兴趣。当谷歌在2018年发布BERT时，我坚信NLP正站在革命的边缘。
- en: In 2022, following the release of text-davinci-002, a model in OpenAI’s GPT-3
    series, I decided to join Yarnit, a generative-AI-based content marketing platform,
    to build the AI backbone of the application. The mission was to create a platform
    where enterprise content marketing teams could generate marketing assets—social
    media posts, blogs, emails, and more—at high speed, large scale, and lower cost,
    with greater accuracy. It quickly became apparent that no generative model could
    achieve this effectively without incorporating brand-specific knowledge and access
    to proprietary data. This realization led me to explore retrieval-augmented generation
    (RAG).

  zh: 在2022年，随着OpenAI的GPT-3系列模型text-davinci-002的发布，我决定加入基于生成式AI的内容营销平台Yarnit，构建应用的AI核心。我们的使命是创建一个平台，企业内容营销团队能够以高速、大规模和低成本生成营销资产——社交媒体帖子、博客、电子邮件等等，并且具有更高的准确性。很快，很明显，没有将品牌特定知识和对专有数据的访问纳入其中的生成模型无法有效地实现这一点。这一认识引导我探索检索增强生成（RAG）。
- en: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to meet user expectations. While they
    are incredibly effective at storing and generating knowledge, they are also prone
    to hallucinations—confident yet incorrect outputs. This is where RAG provides
    a breakthrough, allowing LLMs to retrieve relevant, real-time, and factual information
    before generating responses. The beauty of RAG lies in its simplicity of concept
    combined with the nuance of implementation. The transformative potential of RAG
    in overcoming LLMs’ core limitations is what has kept both researchers and practitioners
    deeply engaged.

  zh: 大型语言模型（LLMs）往往无法满足用户期望。虽然它们在存储和生成知识方面非常有效，但它们也容易产生幻觉——自信但错误的输出。这就是RAG提供突破的地方，它允许LLMs在生成响应之前检索相关、实时和事实信息。RAG的美丽之处在于其概念简单性与实施细节的微妙结合。RAG在克服LLMs核心限制方面的变革潜力，使得研究人员和实践者都保持着高度的兴趣。
- en: When I began researching RAG, it was still a relatively unexplored area. Formal
    learning resources were scarce, and most knowledge was scattered across blogs,
    social media posts, research papers, and discussion forums. I shared many of my
    own findings on social platforms and in blog posts. Eventually, the idea of consolidating
    all these learnings into a comprehensive book took shape.

  zh: 当我开始研究RAG时，它还是一个相对未开发的领域。正式的学习资源很少，大部分知识都散布在博客、社交媒体帖子、研究论文和讨论论坛中。我在社交媒体平台和博客文章中分享了许多自己的发现。最终，将所有这些学习成果整合成一本综合书籍的想法逐渐成形。
- en: With the goal of creating a simple, practical resource for technology professionals
    building LLM-based applications, I started working on this book in mid-2024\.
    Over time, it has evolved into a foundational guide to RAG, covering both breadth
    and depth, while ensuring practical implementation through clear explanations
    and simple Python code.

  zh: 为了创建一个简单、实用的资源，为构建基于大型语言模型（LLM）的应用的技术专业人士提供帮助，我在2024年中期开始着手编写这本书。随着时间的推移，它已经发展成一本关于检索增强生成（RAG）的基础指南，涵盖了广度和深度，同时通过清晰的解释和简单的Python代码确保了实际应用。
- en: I firmly believe that RAG is an essential skill for anyone working with AI applications
    and that mastering it requires a solid conceptual foundation. This book is designed
    to provide just that. Writing it has been an incredibly enriching experience,
    and I have learned a great deal along the way. I hope you find it both enlightening
    and enjoyable.
