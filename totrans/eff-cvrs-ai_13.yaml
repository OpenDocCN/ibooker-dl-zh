- en: People have different expectations for interacting with a chatbot than for interacting
    with other humans. Humans may chit-chat with each other at the start of an interaction,
    but chatbots usually get right to business. Humans are good at smoothing over
    misunderstandings, while chatbots are sometimes, well, robotic.

- en: Users may have a personal bias against chatbots before an interaction starts.
    With a phone-based AI, they may immediately press and hold the 0 key (to get to
    an operator); on a chatbot, they may repeatedly type “representative.” Or they
    may engage in this behavior after the AI makes a mistake. In either case, we call
    these *opt-outs*—the user is opting out of an AI experience and opting for an
    interaction with a human.

- en: Chapter 11 digs into why users opt out at differing points of an interaction
    from the beginning to the end, and it offers techniques that make opt-outs less
    likely. Opt-outs cannot be eliminated, so chapter 12 shows what to do when they
    happen, namely summarizing the AI interaction in a manner useful for a human agent
    who will continue the interaction where the AI left off.
