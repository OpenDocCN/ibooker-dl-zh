- en: This appendix lists many popular generative AI tools available at the time of
    writing. I expect some parts of the AI market to organize as an oligopoly, meaning
    that there will be a few key players instead of a multitude. This will be especially
    true of companies that build foundation models, as model training incurs high
    one-off costs that few companies will be able to afford. So, the market of foundation
    models will become similar to the cloud computing market, which is dominated by
    three main competitors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, I expect convergence in terms of models’ capabilities, as different
    foundation models are becoming increasingly similar. There also seems to be a
    tendency toward building multimodal AI, so you may not need to use different models
    to process text, images, and video.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other cases, such as lighter AI apps (e.g., simple wrappers around LLMs)
    or smaller specialized AI models, we may observe a multitude of competitors. This
    market may become similar to fitness apps, in which there are thousands of options
    to choose from.
