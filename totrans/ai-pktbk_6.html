  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text" id="p2"> 
   <p>This appendix lists many popular generative AI tools available at the time of writing. I expect some parts of the AI market to organize as an oligopoly, meaning that there will be a few key players instead of a multitude. This will be especially true of companies that build foundation models, as model training incurs high one-off costs that few companies will be able to afford. So, the market of foundation models will become similar to the cloud computing market, which is dominated by three main competitors. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p3"> 
   <p>Furthermore, I expect convergence in terms of models’ capabilities, as different foundation models are becoming increasingly similar. There also seems to be a tendency toward building multimodal AI, so you may not need to use different models to process text, images, and video.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p4"> 
   <p>In other cases, such as lighter AI apps (e.g., simple wrappers around LLMs) or smaller specialized AI models, we may observe a multitude of competitors. This market may become similar to fitness apps, in which there are thousands of options to choose from.</p>

   <p>The following are popular tools that help software engineers write code:</p> 
  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p25"><em>GitHub Copilo</em><em>t</em>—An AI coding assistant that can be in­­stalled as a plug-in on multiple popular IDEs. It can be used mainly in two different ways. One way is to type into a chat window to interact with a chatbot and ask questions about the code or ask it to perform tasks. The other way is for the assistant to autocomplete your code as you type it—you can accept suggestions by pressing the Tab key on your keyboard. You must pay a monthly subscription to use it, but there is a free trial. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p26"><em>Curso</em><em>r</em>—A standalone, AI-powered IDE, built on top of Visual Studio. You can chat with the AI assistant or accept code autocompletions by pressing the Tab key. There is a free version with a limited number of completions and paid subscriptions with a higher number or an unlimited number of completions.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p27"><em>JetBrains AI Pr</em><em>o</em>—The company behind popular IDEs such as PyCharm and IntelliJ offers an add-on subscription to access an AI assistant. You can chat with the assistant about the code, and you can also accept autocompletions by pressing the Tab key. These autocompletions are powered by their cloud-based LLM, but users not subscribed to the AI add-on can still benefit from simpler autocompletions run locally. Users must pay a monthly license to add the AI assistant to its IDEs. </li>

In addition to making the models publicly available, the company has released the data used to train its models and the algorithms used to filter and curate the data. Stable Diffusion is released under an open source license with usage restrictions. In particular, users are not allowed to “generate or disseminate verifiably false information,” “harm minors,” or “provide medical advice,” among other restrictions (<a href="https://mng.bz/YDpe"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/mng.bz/YDpe</span></a>).</li>

  </div> 
  <ul> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p41"><em>Hugging Fac</em><em>e</em>—This company hosts the de facto repository of AI models. Open source models are usually published there. The company also maintains a suite of libraries, including <em>Transformers,</em> which helps use pretrained models. The company also maintains libraries that help fine-tune models easily.</li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p42"><em>PyTorc</em><em>h</em>—A popular Python library used to create and train machine learning models. Historically, PyTorch has been favored by the academic community, which uses the library to quickly prototype and analyze models, although it seems to be growing in popularity elsewhere. Hugging Face’s Transformers library is built on top of PyTorch. </li> 
   <li class="readable-text" id="p43"><em>TensorFlo</em><em>w</em>—A popular alternative to PyTorch. It is usually favored by those who deploy high-performing ML models in production, although it seems to be losing popularity to PyTorch as of late. The GPT-2 model, whose code was made publicly available by OpenAI, uses TensorFlow (<a href="https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/"><span class="Hyperlink">https:</span><span class="Hyperlink">/</span><span class="Hyperlink">/github.com/openai/gpt-2/</span></a>).
