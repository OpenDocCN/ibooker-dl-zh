This is because each image is 28 × 28 pixels, and each feature simply represents one pixel’s intensity, from 0 (white) to 255 (black). Let’s take a peek at one digit from the dataset ([Figure 3-1](#some_digit_plot)). All we need to do is grab an instance’s feature vector, reshape it to a 28 × 28 array, and display it using Matplotlib’s `imshow()` function. We use `cmap=\"binary\"` to get a grayscale color map where 0 is white and 255 is black:    ```py import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  def plot_digit(image_data):     image = image_data.reshape(28, 28)     plt.imshow(image, cmap=\"binary\")     plt.axis(\"off\")  some_digit = X[0] plot_digit(some_digit) plt.show() ```  ![A pixelated grayscale image of a handwritten digit resembling the number 5, from the MNIST dataset.](assets/hmls_0301.png)  ###### Figure 3-1\\. Example of an MNIST image    This looks like a 5, and indeed that’s what the label tells us:    ```py >>> y[0] `'5'` ```   ```py`To give you a feel for the complexity of the classification task, [Figure 3-2](#more_digits_plot) shows a few more images from the MNIST dataset. There’s quite a large variety of digit shapes. That said, the images are clean, well centered, not too rotated, and the digits all have roughly the same size: this dataset will not require much preprocessing (real-world datasets aren’t usually that friendly).    But wait! You should always create a test set and set it aside before inspecting the data closely. The MNIST dataset returned by `fetch_openml()` is actually already split into a training set (the first 60,000 images) and a test set (the last 10,000 images):^([2](ch03.html#id1288))    ``` X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = X[:60000], X[60000:], y[:60000], y[60000:] ```py    The training set is already shuffled for us, which is good because this guarantees that all cross-validation folds will be similar (we don’t want one fold to be missing some digits). Moreover, some learning algorithms are sensitive to the order of the training instances, and they perform poorly if they get many similar instances in a row. Shuffling the dataset ensures that this won’t happen.⁠^([3](ch03.html#id1293))  ![Handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, showcasing a variety of numbers used to train machine learning models.](assets/hmls_0302.png)  ###### Figure 3-2\\.

This “5-detector” will be an example of a *binary classifier*, capable of distinguishing between just two classes, 5 and non-5\\. First we’ll create the target vectors for this classification task:    ```py y_train_5 = (y_train == '5')  # True for all 5s, False for all other digits y_test_5 = (y_test == '5') ```    Now let’s pick a classifier and train it. A good place to start is with a *stochastic gradient descent* (SGD, or stochastic GD) classifier, using Scikit-Learn’s `SGDClassifier` class. This classifier is capable of handling very large datasets efficiently. This is in part because SGD deals with training instances independently, one at a time, which also makes SGD well suited for online learning, as you will see later. Let’s create an `SGDClassifier` and train it on the whole training set:    ```py from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier  sgd_clf = SGDClassifier(random_state=42) sgd_clf.fit(X_train, y_train_5) ```    Now we can use it to detect images of the number 5:    ```py >>> sgd_clf.predict([some_digit]) `array([ True])` ```   ``The classifier guesses that this image represents a 5 (`True`). Looks like it guessed right in this particular case! Now, let’s evaluate this model’s performance.``  ```py```````", "```````py`````` # Performance Measures    Evaluating a classifier is often significantly trickier than evaluating a regressor, so we will spend a large part of this chapter on this topic. There are many performance measures available, so grab another coffee and get ready to learn a bunch of new concepts and acronyms!    ## Measuring Accuracy Using Cross-Validation    A good way to evaluate a model is to use cross-validation, just as you did in [Chapter 2](ch02.html#project_chapter). Let’s use the `cross_val_score()` function to evaluate our `SGDClassifier` model, using *k*-fold cross-validation with three folds. Remember that *k*-fold cross-validation means splitting the training set into *k* folds (in this case, three), then training the model *k* times, holding out a different fold each time for evaluation (see [Chapter 2](ch02.html#project_chapter)):    ```py >>> from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score `>>>` `cross_val_score``(``sgd_clf``,` `X_train``,` `y_train_5``,` `cv``=``3``,` `scoring``=``\"accuracy\"``)` `` `array([0.95035, 0.96035, 0.9604 ])` `` ```   ```py`` ```` Wow! Above 95% accuracy (ratio of correct predictions) on all cross-validation folds? This looks amazing, doesn’t it? Well, before you get too excited, let’s look at a dummy classifier that just classifies every single image in the most frequent class, which in this case is the negative class (i.e., *non*-5):    ```py from sklearn.dummy import DummyClassifier  dummy_clf = DummyClassifier() dummy_clf.fit(X_train, y_train_5) print(any(dummy_clf.predict(X_train)))  # prints False: no 5s detected ```    Can you guess this model’s accuracy? Let’s find out:    ```py >>> cross_val_score(dummy_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3, scoring=\"accuracy\") `array([0.90965, 0.90965, 0.90965])` ```   `That’s right, it has over 90% accuracy! This is simply because only about 10% of the images are 5s, so if you always guess that an image is *not* a 5, you will be right about 90% of the time. Beats Nostradamus.    This demonstrates why accuracy is generally not the preferred performance measure for classifiers, especially when you are dealing with *skewed datasets* (i.e., when some classes are much more frequent than others). A much better way to evaluate the performance of a classifier is to look at the *confusion matrix* (CM).` ```py` `````  ```py```````", "```````py````` ```py```````", "```````py```` ```py```````", "```````py``` ## Confusion Matrices    The general idea of a confusion matrix is to count the number of times instances of class A are classified as class B, for all A/B pairs. For example, to know the number of times the classifier confused images of 8s with 0s, you would look at row #8, column #0 of the confusion matrix.    To compute the confusion matrix, you first need to have a set of predictions so that they can be compared to the actual targets. You could make predictions on the test set, but it’s best to keep that untouched for now (remember that you want to use the test set only at the very end of your project, once you have a classifier that you are ready to launch). Instead, you can use the `cross_val_predict()` function:    ``` from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict  y_train_pred = cross_val_predict(sgd_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3) ```py    Just like the `cross_val_score()` function, `cross_val_predict()` performs *k*-fold cross-validation, but instead of returning the evaluation scores, it returns the predictions made on each test fold. This means that you get a clean prediction for each instance in the training set (by “clean” I mean “out-of-sample”: the model makes predictions on data that it never saw during training).    Now you are ready to get the confusion matrix using the `confusion_matrix()` function. Just pass it the target classes (`y_train_5`) and the predicted classes (`y_train_pred`):    ``` >>> from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix `>>>` `cm` `=` `confusion_matrix``(``y_train_5``,` `y_train_pred``)` ```py `>>>` `cm` `` `array([[53892,   687],`  `[ 1891,  3530]])` `` ``` ```py   ``````py ````` ```py` Each row in a confusion matrix represents an *actual class*, while each column represents a *predicted class*. The first row of this matrix considers non-5 images (the *negative class*): 53,892 of them were correctly classified as non-5s (they are called *true negatives*), while the remaining 687 were wrongly classified as 5s (*false positives*, also called *type I errors*). The second row considers the images of 5s (the *positive class*): 1,891 were wrongly classified as non-5s (*false negatives*, also called *type II errors*), while the remaining 3,530 were correctly classified as 5s (*true positives*). A perfect classifier would only have true positives and true negatives, so its confusion matrix would have nonzero values only on its main diagonal (top left to bottom right):    ``` >>> y_train_perfect_predictions = y_train_5  # pretend we reached perfection `>>>` `confusion_matrix``(``y_train_5``,` `y_train_perfect_predictions``)` `` `array([[54579,     0],`  `[    0,  5421]])` `` ```py   `` `The confusion matrix gives you a lot of information, but sometimes you may prefer a more concise metric. An interesting one to look at is the accuracy of the positive predictions; this is called the *precision* of the classifier ([Equation 3-1](#equation_three_one)).    ##### Equation 3-1\\. Precision  $precision equals StartFraction upper T upper P Over upper T upper P plus upper F upper P EndFraction$  *TP* is the number of true positives, and *FP* is the number of false positives.    Now consider a model that only makes positive predictions when it’s extremely confident. Let’s push this to the extreme and suppose that it always makes negative predictions, except for a single positive prediction on the instance it’s most confident about. If this one prediction is correct, then the classifier has 100% precision (precision = 1/1 = 100%). Obviously, such a classifier would not be very useful, since it would ignore all but one positive instance. For this reason, precision is typically used along with another metric named *recall*, also called *sensitivity* or the *true positive rate* (TPR): this is the ratio of positive instances that are correctly detected by the classifier ([Equation 3-2](#equation_three_two)).    ##### Equation 3-2\\. Recall  $recall equals StartFraction upper T upper P Over upper T upper P plus upper F upper N EndFraction$  *FN* is, of course, the number of false negatives.    If you are confused about the confusion matrix, [Figure 3-3](#confusion_matrix_diagram) may help.  ![Illustrated confusion matrix with examples of true negatives, false positives, false negatives, and true positives, used to explain prediction performance.](assets/hmls_0303.png)  ###### Figure 3-3\\.

When it claims an image represents a 5, it is correct only 83.7% of the time. Moreover, it only detects 65.1% of the 5s.    It is often convenient to combine precision and recall into a single metric called the *F[1] score*, especially when you need a single metric to compare two classifiers. The F[1] score is the *harmonic mean* of precision and recall ([Equation 3-3](#equation_three_three)). Whereas the regular mean treats all values equally, the harmonic mean gives much more weight to low values. As a result, the classifier will only get a high F[1] score if both recall and precision are high.    ##### Equation 3-3\\.

This is not always what you want: in some contexts you mostly care about precision, and in other contexts you really care about recall. For example, if you trained a classifier to detect videos that are safe for kids, you would probably prefer a classifier that rejects many good videos (low recall) but keeps only safe ones (high precision), rather than a classifier that has a much higher recall but lets a few really bad videos show up in your product (in such cases, you may even want to add a human pipeline to check the classifier’s video selection). On the other hand, suppose you train a classifier to detect shoplifters in surveillance images: it is probably fine if your classifier only has 30% precision as long as it has 99% recall. Sure, the security guards will get a few false alerts, but almost all shoplifters will get caught. Similarly, medical diagnosis usually requires a high recall to avoid missing anything important. False positives can be ruled out by follow-up medical tests.    Unfortunately, you can’t have it both ways: increasing precision reduces recall, and vice versa.

For many applications, 48% recall wouldn’t be great at all.    ###### Tip    If someone says, “Let’s reach 99% precision”, you should ask, “At what recall?”    Since Scikit-Learn 1.5, there are two new classes you can use to more easily adjust the decision threshold:    *   The `FixedThresholdClassifier` class lets you wrap a binary classifier and set the desired threshold manually. If the underlying classifier has a `predict_proba()` method, then the threshold should be a value between 0 and 1 (the default is 0.5). Otherwise, it should be a decision score, comparable to the output of the model’s `decision_function()` (the default is 0).           *   The `TunedThresholdClassifierCV` class uses *k*-fold cross-validation to automatically find the optimal threshold for a given metric. By default, it tries to find the threshold that maximizes the model’s *balanced accuracy*: that’s the average of each class’s recall. However, you can select another metric to optimize for (see the documentation for the full list of options).`` ```py ```` ```py`` `````", "``````py` ``````", "``````py``` ``````", "```` ```py````", "```py` ```", "```py```", "``` ```", "```````py```  ``````py``` ``````py`` ``````py` ## The ROC Curve    The *receiver operating characteristic* (ROC) curve is another common tool used with binary classifiers. It is very similar to the precision/recall curve, but instead of plotting precision versus recall, the ROC curve plots the *true positive rate* (another name for recall) against the *false positive rate* (FPR). The FPR (also called the *fall-out*) is the ratio of negative instances that are incorrectly classified as positive. It is equal to 1 – the *true negative rate* (TNR), which is the ratio of negative instances that are correctly classified as negative. The TNR is also called *specificity*. Hence, the ROC curve plots *sensitivity* (recall) versus 1 – *specificity*.    To plot the ROC curve, you first use the `roc_curve()` function to compute the TPR and FPR for various threshold values:    ``` from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve  fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_train_5, y_scores) ```py    Then you can plot the FPR against the TPR using Matplotlib. The following code produces the plot in [Figure 3-7](#roc_curve_plot). To find the point that corresponds to 90% precision, we need to look for the index of the desired threshold. Since thresholds are listed in decreasing order in this case, we use `<=` instead of `>=` on the first line:    ``` idx_for_threshold_at_90 = (thresholds <= threshold_for_90_precision).argmax() tpr_90, fpr_90 = tpr[idx_for_threshold_at_90], fpr[idx_for_threshold_at_90]  plt.plot(fpr, tpr, linewidth=2, label=\"ROC curve\") plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], 'k:', label=\"Random classifier's ROC curve\") plt.plot([fpr_90], [tpr_90], \"ko\", label=\"Threshold for 90% precision\") [...]  # beautify the figure: add labels, grid, legend, arrow, and text plt.show() ```py    Once again there is a trade-off: the higher the recall (TPR), the more false positives (FPR) the classifier produces. The dotted line represents the ROC curve of a purely random classifier; a good classifier stays as far away from that line as possible (toward the top-left corner).    One way to compare classifiers is to measure the *area under the curve* (AUC). A perfect classifier will have a ROC AUC equal to 1, whereas a purely random classifier will have a ROC AUC equal to 0.5\\. Scikit-Learn provides a function to estimate the ROC AUC:    ``` >>> from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score `>>>` `roc_auc_score``(``y_train_5``,` `y_scores``)` `` `np.float64(0.9604938554008616)` `` ```py  ``````py ````` ![ROC curve showing the true positive rate versus the false positive rate, with a highlighted point indicating a threshold for 90% precision and 48% recall.](assets/hmls_0307.png)  ###### Figure 3-7\\. A ROC curve plotting the false positive rate against the true positive rate for all possible thresholds; the black circle highlights the chosen ratio (at 90% precision and 48% recall)    ###### Tip    Since the ROC curve is so similar to the precision/recall (PR) curve, you may wonder how to decide which one to use. As a rule of thumb, you should prefer the PR curve whenever the positive class is rare or when you care more about the false positives than the false negatives. Otherwise, use the ROC curve. For example, looking at the previous ROC curve (and the ROC AUC score), you may think that the classifier is really good. But this is mostly because there are few positives (5s) compared to the negatives (non-5s). In contrast, the PR curve makes it clear that the classifier has room for improvement: the curve could really be closer to the top-right corner (see [Figure 3-6](#precision_vs_recall_plot) again).    Let’s now create a `RandomForestClassifier`, whose PR curve and F[1] score we can compare to those of the `SGDClassifier`:    ```py from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier  forest_clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42) ```    The `precision_recall_curve()` function expects labels and scores for each instance, so we need to train the random forest classifier and make it assign a score to each instance. But the `RandomForestClassifier` class does not have a `decision_function()` method, due to the way it works (we will cover this in [Chapter 6](ch06.html#ensembles_chapter)). Luckily, it has a `predict_proba()` method that returns estimated class probabilities for each instance, and we can just use the probability of the positive class as a score, so `precision_recall_curve()` will work.^([4](ch03.html#id1369)) We can call the `cross_val_​predict()` function to train the `RandomForestClassifier` using cross-validation and make it predict class probabilities for every image as follows:    ```py y_probas_forest = cross_val_predict(forest_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3,                                     method=\"predict_proba\") ```    Let’s look at the estimated class probabilities for the first two images in the training set:    ```py >>> y_probas_forest[:2] `array([[0.11, 0.89],`  `[0.99, 0.01]])` ```   ```py` The model predicts that the first image is positive with 89% probability, and it predicts that the second image is negative with 99% probability. Since each image is either positive or negative, the estimated probabilities in each row add up to 100%.    ###### Warning    These are *estimated* probabilities, not actual probabilities. For example, if you look at all the images that the model classified as positive with an estimated probability between 50% and 60%, roughly 94% of them are actually positive. So, the model’s estimated probabilities were much too low in this case—but models can be overconfident as well. The `CalibratedClassifierCV` class from the `sklearn.calibration` package can calibrate the estimated probabilities using cross-validation, making them much closer to actual probabilities (see the notebook for a code example). This is important in some scenarios, such as medical diagnosis, financial risk assessment, or fraud detection.    The second column contains the estimated probabilities for the positive class, so let’s pass them to the `precision_recall_curve()` function:    ``` y_scores_forest = y_probas_forest[:, 1] precisions_forest, recalls_forest, thresholds_forest = precision_recall_curve(     y_train_5, y_scores_forest) ```py    Now we’re ready to plot the PR curve. It is useful to plot the first PR curve as well to see how they compare ([Figure 3-8](#pr_curve_comparison_plot)):    ``` plt.plot(recalls_forest, precisions_forest, \"b-\", linewidth=2,          label=\"Random Forest\") plt.plot(recalls, precisions, \"--\", linewidth=2, label=\"SGD\") [...]  # beautify the figure: add labels, grid, and legend plt.show() ```py  ![Precision-recall curves compare the performance of RandomForestClassifier and SGDClassifier, with the RandomForest curve closer to the top-right corner, indicating superior performance.](assets/hmls_0308.png)  ###### Figure 3-8\\. Comparing PR curves: the random forest classifier is superior to the SGD classifier because its PR curve is much closer to the top-right corner, and it has a greater AUC    As you can see in [Figure 3-8](#pr_curve_comparison_plot), the `RandomForestClassifier`’s PR curve looks much better than the `SGDClassifier`’s: it comes much closer to the top-right corner. Its F[1] score and ROC AUC score are also significantly better:    ``` >>> y_train_pred_forest = y_probas_forest[:, 1] >= 0.5  # positive proba ≥ 50% `>>>` `f1_score``(``y_train_5``,` `y_train_pred_forest``)` ```py `0.9274509803921569` `>>>` `roc_auc_score``(``y_train_5``,` `y_scores_forest``)` `` `0.9983436731328145` `` ``` ```py   ``` `` `Try measuring the precision and recall scores: you should find about 99.0% precision and 87.3% recall.

Some Scikit-Learn classifiers (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, `RandomForestClassifier`, and `GaussianNB`) are capable of handling multiple classes natively. Others are strictly binary classifiers (e.g., `SGDClassifier` and `SVC`). However, there are various strategies that you can use to perform multiclass classification with multiple binary classifiers.    One way to create a system that can classify the digit images into 10 classes (from 0 to 9) is to train 10 binary classifiers, one for each digit (a 0-detector, a 1-detector, a 2-detector, and so on). Then when you want to classify an image, you get the decision score from each classifier for that image and you select the class whose classifier outputs the highest score. This is called the *one-versus-the-rest* (OvR) strategy, or sometimes *one-versus-all* (OvA).    Another strategy is to train a binary classifier for every pair of digits: one to distinguish 0s and 1s, another to distinguish 0s and 2s, another for 1s and 2s, and so on. This is called the *one-versus-one* (OvO) strategy. If there are *N* classes, you need to train *N* × (*N* – 1) / 2 classifiers. For the MNIST problem, this means training 45 binary classifiers! When you want to classify an image, you have to run the image through all 45 classifiers and see which class wins the most duels. The main advantage of OvO is that each classifier only needs to be trained on the part of the training set containing the two classes that it must distinguish.    Some algorithms (such as support vector machine classifiers) scale poorly with the size of the training set. For these algorithms OvO is preferred because it is faster to train many classifiers on small training sets than to train few classifiers on large training sets. For most binary classification algorithms, however, OvR is preferred.    Scikit-Learn detects when you try to use a binary classification algorithm for a multiclass classification task, and it automatically runs OvR or OvO, depending on the algorithm. Let’s try this with a support vector machine classifier using the `sklearn.svm.SVC` class (see the online chapter on SVMs at [*https://homl.info*](https://homl.info)). We’ll only train on the first 2,000 images, or else it will take a very long time:    ```py from sklearn.svm import SVC  svm_clf = SVC(random_state=42) svm_clf.fit(X_train[:2000], y_train[:2000])  # y_train, not y_train_5 ```    That was easy! We trained the `SVC` using the original target classes from 0 to 9 (`y_train`), instead of the 5-versus-the-rest target classes (`y_train_5`). Since there are 10 classes (i.e., more than 2), Scikit-Learn used the OvO strategy and trained 45 binary classifiers. Now let’s make a prediction on an image:    ```py >>> svm_clf.predict([some_digit]) `array(['5'], dtype=object)` ```   ```py``````", "```````py` That’s correct! This code actually made 45 predictions—one per pair of classes—and it selected the class that won the most duels.⁠^([5](ch03.html#id1386)) If you call the `decision_function()` method, you will see that it returns 10 scores per instance: one per class. Each class gets a score equal to the number of won duels plus or minus a small tweak (max ±0.33) to break ties, based on the classifier scores:    ``` >>> some_digit_scores = svm_clf.decision_function([some_digit]) `>>>` `some_digit_scores``.``round``(``2``)` `` `array([[ 3.79,  0.73,  6.06,  8.3 , -0.29,  9.3 ,  1.75,  2.77,  7.21,`  `4.82]])` `` ```py   ``````py```````", "```` ```py````", "```py```", "``` The highest score is 9.3, and it’s indeed the one corresponding to class 5:    ```", "```   ```", "```````py````` ```py```````", "```` When a classifier is trained, it stores the list of target classes in its `classes_` attribute, ordered by value. In the case of MNIST, the index of each class in the `classes_` array conveniently matches the class itself (e.g., the class at index 5 happens to be class `'5'`), but in general you won’t be so lucky; you will need to look up the class label like this:    ```py >>> svm_clf.classes_ `array(['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'], dtype=object)` `>>>` `svm_clf``.``classes_``[``class_id``]` `` `'5'` `` ```   ```py````", "```py```", "``````py``````", "```py from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier  ovr_clf = OneVsRestClassifier(SVC(random_state=42)) ovr_clf.fit(X_train[:2000], y_train[:2000]) ```", "```py >>> ovr_clf.predict([some_digit]) `array(['5'], dtype='<U1')` `>>>` `len``(``ovr_clf``.``estimators_``)` `` `10` `` ```", "```py```", "````py` ````", "```` Training an `SGDClassifier` on a multiclass dataset and using it to make predictions is just as easy:    ```py >>> sgd_clf = SGDClassifier(random_state=42) `>>>` `sgd_clf``.``fit``(``X_train``,` `y_train``)` ``` `>>>` `sgd_clf``.``predict``([``some_digit``])` `` `array(['3'], dtype='<U1')` `` ```py ```   ```py````", "```py```", "```py```", "```py >>> sgd_clf.decision_function([some_digit]).round() `array([[-31893., -34420.,  -9531.,   1824., -22320.,  -1386., -26189.,`  `-16148.,  -4604., -12051.]])` ```", "```py```", "``` >>> cross_val_score(sgd_clf, X_train, y_train, cv=3, scoring=\"accuracy\") `array([0.87365, 0.85835, 0.8689 ])` ```", "````` It gets over 85.8% on all test folds. If you used a random classifier, you would get 10% accuracy, so this is not such a bad score, but you can still do much better. Simply scaling the inputs (as discussed in [Chapter 2](ch02.html#project_chapter)) increases accuracy above 89.1%:    ```py >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler `>>>` `scaler` `=` `StandardScaler``()` ```` `>>>` `X_train_scaled` `=` `scaler``.``fit_transform``(``X_train``.``astype``(``\"float64\"``))` ```py `>>>` `cross_val_score``(``sgd_clf``,` `X_train_scaled``,` `y_train``,` `cv``=``3``,` `scoring``=``\"accuracy\"``)` `` `array([0.8983, 0.891 , 0.9018])` `` ``` ```py` ``` ```py`` `````", "``````py` ``````", "``````py``` ``````", "```` ```py````", "```py` ```", "```py```", "``` ```", "```````py``` ``````py```````", "``````py``````", "``````py``````", "``` ```", "```py```", "````py````", "```py```", "````py````", "```py`  ```", "```py```", "``````py`` ``````", "``` from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay  y_train_pred = cross_val_predict(sgd_clf, X_train_scaled, y_train, cv=3) ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(y_train, y_train_pred) plt.show() ```", "``` ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(y_train, y_train_pred,                                         normalize=\"true\", values_format=\".0%\") plt.show() ```", "``` sample_weight = (y_train_pred != y_train) ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(y_train, y_train_pred,                                         sample_weight=sample_weight,                                         normalize=\"true\", values_format=\".0%\") plt.show() ```", "``` cl_a, cl_b = '3', '5' X_aa = X_train[(y_train == cl_a) & (y_train_pred == cl_a)] X_ab = X_train[(y_train == cl_a) & (y_train_pred == cl_b)] X_ba = X_train[(y_train == cl_b) & (y_train_pred == cl_a)] X_bb = X_train[(y_train == cl_b) & (y_train_pred == cl_b)] [...]  # plot all images in X_aa, X_ab, X_ba, X_bb in a confusion matrix style ```", "``` import numpy as np from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier  y_train_large = (y_train >= '7') y_train_odd = (y_train.astype('int8') % 2 == 1) y_multilabel = np.c_[y_train_large, y_train_odd]  knn_clf = KNeighborsClassifier() knn_clf.fit(X_train, y_multilabel) ```", "``` >>> knn_clf.predict([some_digit]) `array([[False,  True]])` ```", "``````py And it gets it right! The digit 5 is indeed not large (`False`) and odd (`True`).    There are many ways to evaluate a multilabel classifier, and selecting the right metric really depends on your project. One approach is to measure the F[1] score for each individual label (or any other binary classifier metric discussed earlier), then simply compute the average score. The following code computes the average F[1] score across all labels:    ``` >>> y_train_knn_pred = cross_val_predict(knn_clf, X_train, y_multilabel, cv=3) `>>>` `f1_score``(``y_multilabel``,` `y_train_knn_pred``,` `average``=``\"macro\"``)` `` `0.976410265560605` `` ```py   ````` ```py` This approach assumes that all labels are equally important, which may not be the case. In particular, if you have many more pictures of Alice than of Bob or Charlie, you may want to give more weight to the classifier’s score on pictures of Alice. One simple option is to give each label a weight equal to its *support* (i.e., the number of instances with that target label). To do this, simply set `average=\"weighted\"` when calling the `f1_score()` function.⁠^([6](ch03.html#id1415))    If you wish to use a classifier that does not natively support multilabel classification, such as `SVC`, one possible strategy is to train one model per label. However, this strategy may have a hard time capturing the dependencies between the labels. For example, a large digit (7, 8, or 9) is twice more likely to be odd than even, but the classifier for the “odd” label does not know what the classifier for the “large” label predicted. To solve this issue, the models can be organized in a chain: when a model makes a prediction, it uses the input features plus all the predictions of the models that come before it in the chain.    The good news is that Scikit-Learn has a class called `ClassifierChain` that does just that! By default it will use the true labels for training, feeding each model the appropriate labels depending on their position in the chain. But if you set the `cv` hyperparameter, it will use cross-validation to get “clean” (out-of-sample) predictions from each trained model for every instance in the training set, and these predictions will then be used to train all the models later in the chain. Note that the order of the classifiers in the chain may affect the final performance. Here’s an example showing how to create and train a `ClassifierChain` using the cross-validation strategy. As earlier, we’ll just use the first 2,000 images in the training set to speed things up:    ``` from sklearn.multioutput import ClassifierChain  chain_clf = ClassifierChain(SVC(), cv=3, random_state=42) chain_clf.fit(X_train[:2000], y_multilabel[:2000]) ```py    Now we can use this `ClassifierChain` to make predictions:    ``` >>> chain_clf.predict([some_digit]) `array([[0., 1.]])` ```py ```` ```py`` ``````", "``````py ````` ```py`# Multioutput Classification    The last type of classification task we’ll discuss here is called *multioutput–multiclass classification* (or just *multioutput classification*). It is a generalization of multilabel classification where each label can be multiclass (i.e., it can have more than two possible values).    To illustrate this, let’s build a system that removes noise from images. It will take as input a noisy digit image, and it will (hopefully) output a clean digit image, represented as an array of pixel intensities, just like the MNIST images. Notice that the classifier’s output is multilabel (one label per pixel) and each label can have multiple values (pixel intensity ranges from 0 to 255). This is thus an example of a multioutput classification system.    ###### Note    The line between classification and regression is sometimes blurry, such as in this example. Arguably, predicting pixel intensity is more akin to regression than to classification. Moreover, multioutput systems are not limited to classification tasks; you could even have a system that outputs multiple labels per instance, including both class labels and value labels.    Let’s start by creating the training and test sets by taking the MNIST images and adding noise to their pixel intensities, using a random number generator’s `integers()` method. The target images will be the original images:    ``` rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=42) noise_train = rng.integers(0, 100, (len(X_train), 784)) X_train_mod = X_train + noise_train noise_test = rng.integers(0, 100, (len(X_test), 784)) X_test_mod = X_test + noise_test y_train_mod = X_train y_test_mod = X_test ```py    Let’s take a peek at the first image from the test set ([Figure 3-12](#noisy_digit_example_plot)). Yes, we’re snooping on the test data, so you should be frowning right now.  ![A pixelated, noisy image of the number seven on the left and a clean version on the right, illustrating the effect of noise reduction.](assets/hmls_0312.png)  ###### Figure 3-12\\. A noisy image (left) and the target clean image (right)    On the left is the noisy input image, and on the right is the clean target image. Now let’s train the classifier and make it clean up this image ([Figure 3-13](#cleaned_digit_example_plot)):    ``` knn_clf = KNeighborsClassifier() knn_clf.fit(X_train_mod, y_train_mod) clean_digit = knn_clf.predict([X_test_mod[0]]) plot_digit(clean_digit) plt.show() ```py  ![A grayscale pixelated image of the digit seven, demonstrating a cleaned-up version after applying a K-Neighbors Classifier.](assets/hmls_0313.png)  ###### Figure 3-13\\. The cleaned-up image    Looks close enough to the target! This concludes our tour of classification. You now know how to select good metrics for classification tasks, pick the appropriate precision/recall trade-off, compare classifiers, and more generally build good classification systems for a variety of tasks. In the next chapters, you’ll learn how all these machine learning models you’ve been using actually work.    # Exercises    1.  Try to build a classifier for the MNIST dataset that achieves over 97% accuracy on the test set. Hint: the `KNeighborsClassifier` works quite well for this task; you just need to find good hyperparameter values (try a grid search on the `weights` and `n_neighbors` hyperparameters).           2.  Write a function that can shift an MNIST image in any direction (left, right, up, or down) by one pixel.⁠^([7](ch03.html#id1426)) Then, for each image in the training set, create four shifted copies (one per direction) and add them to the training set. Finally, train your best model on this expanded training set and measure its accuracy on the test set. You should observe that your model performs even better now! This technique of artificially growing the training set is called *data augmentation* or *training set expansion*.           3.  Tackle the Titanic dataset. A great place to start is on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/c/titanic). Alternatively, you can download the data from [*https://homl.info/titanic.tgz*](https://homl.info/titanic.tgz) and unzip this tarball like you did for the housing data in [Chapter 2](ch02.html#project_chapter). This will give you two CSV files, *train.csv* and *test.csv*, which you can load using `pandas.read_csv()`. The goal is to train a classifier that can predict the `Survived` column based on the other columns.           4.  Build a spam classifier (a more challenging exercise):               1.  Download examples of spam and ham from [Apache SpamAssassin’s public datasets](https://homl.info/spamassassin).                       2.  Unzip the datasets and familiarize yourself with the data format.                       3.  Split the data into a training set and a test set.                       4.  Write a data preparation pipeline to convert each email into a feature vector. Your preparation pipeline should transform an email into a (sparse) vector that indicates the presence or absence of each possible word. For example, if all emails only ever contain four words, “Hello”, “how”, “are”, “you”, then the email “Hello you Hello Hello you” would be converted into a vector [1, 0, 0, 1] (meaning [“Hello” is present, “how” is absent, “are” is absent, “you” is present]), or [3, 0, 0, 2] if you prefer to count the number of occurrences of each word.                                    You may want to add hyperparameters to your preparation pipeline to control whether to strip off email headers, convert each email to lowercase, remove punctuation, replace all URLs with “URL”, replace all numbers with “NUMBER”, or even perform *stemming* (i.e., trim off word endings; there are Python libraries available to do this).                       5.  Finally, try out several classifiers and see if you can build a great spam classifier, with both high recall and high precision.                      Solutions to these exercises are available at the end of this chapter’s notebook, at [*https://homl.info/colab-p*](https://homl.info/colab-p).    ^([1](ch03.html#id1283-marker)) By default Scikit-Learn caches downloaded datasets in a directory called *scikit_learn_data* in your home directory.    ^([2](ch03.html#id1288-marker)) Datasets returned by `fetch_openml()` are not always shuffled or split.    ^([3](ch03.html#id1293-marker)) Shuffling may be a bad idea in some contexts—for example, if you are working on time series data (such as stock market prices or weather conditions). We will explore this in [Chapter 13](ch13.html#rnn_chapter).    ^([4](ch03.html#id1369-marker)) Scikit-Learn classifiers always have either a `decision_function()` method or a `predict_proba()` method, or sometimes both.    ^([5](ch03.html#id1386-marker)) In case of a tie, the first class is selected, unless you set the `break_ties` hyperparameters to `True`, in which case ties are broken using the output of the `decision_function()`.    ^([6](ch03.html#id1415-marker)) Scikit-Learn offers a few other averaging options and multilabel classifier metrics; see the documentation for more details.    ^([7](ch03.html#id1426-marker)) You can use the `shift()` function from the `scipy.ndimage.interpolation` module. For example, `shift(image, [2, 1], cval=0)` shifts the image two pixels down and one pixel to the right.```` ```py`` ``````", "``````py` ``````", "``````py``` ``````", "```````py`````` ```py```````", "```````py``` ``````py```````", "```````py` ``````py```````", "```````py``` ``````py```````", "```````py```` ```py```````", "```````py```````", "``````py``````", "```````py``````"]
