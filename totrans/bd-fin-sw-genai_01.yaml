- en: The term “FinTech” became common in the last few decades as shorthand for financial
    technology. In fact, *financial technology* is a term that could be applied to
    inventions from long ago, such as the 19th-century cash register and telegraph,
    and even the earliest coin purses from circa 3,300 BCE. Today, FinTech helps empower
    crowdfunding opportunities through websites such as GoFundMe and Kickstarter.
    Gig service apps such as Uber and DoorDash rely on FinTech to facilitate fast
    payments. Payment services such as Venmo and Zelle can offer fast person-to-person
    (P2P) and business-to-business (B2B) payments thanks to FinTech. Cryptocurrencies
    like Bitcoin and Ethereum are certainly classified as FinTech, but even the more
    traditional banking, investing, and credit companies have FinTech at their core.

  zh: “FinTech”这个术语在过去的几十年中变得普遍，作为金融技术的简称。实际上，“金融技术”这个术语可以应用于很久以前的发明，比如19世纪的现金登记机和电报，甚至可以追溯到公元前3300年的最早的钱包。如今，FinTech通过GoFundMe和Kickstarter等网站帮助赋予众筹机会。像Uber和DoorDash这样的零工服务应用依赖FinTech来促进快速支付。像Venmo和Zelle这样的支付服务能够提供快速的个人对个人（P2P）和企业对企业（B2B）支付，这都得益于FinTech。比特币和以太坊这样的加密货币当然被归类为FinTech，但即使是更传统的银行、投资和信贷公司，其核心也都有FinTech的元素。

- en: As part of the PI planning, the division displays a product roadmap for the
    coming year that shows various commitments the business has made, expected regulatory
    changes, and company initiatives. During this PI planning session, work will be
    broken up into epics. These epics are larger projects or initiatives. For instance,
    some companies may call their release an epic (such as the Spring 2024 release),
    and projects for the release are broken down into user stories. Still others may
    create their individual projects as epics and break down tasks for that project
    as user stories. Throughout the book, we try to work in short development cycles,
    and that is one of the main concepts of Agile as well. If we are breaking up the
    work into smaller manageable pieces, we should be okay, regardless of what we
    call those smaller chunks (of course, having some consistency helps with communication).

    type task—a necessity for business but nothing more. However, since ACH is such
    a large part of how transactions are being processed by financial institutions,
    customers have begun asking for enhanced functionality for some time now. To maintain
    a competitive advantage, the business wants to modernize the dashboard. There
    is potential for better analytics of the transactions, fraud monitoring, as well
    as expanding the use of the dashboard to customers originating transactions. With
    these capabilities on the agenda, we need to look at providing a product that
    not only provides those capabilities but has a look and feel consistent with the
    rest of the products offered. Figure 1.5 shows an example of how the legacy interface
    currently looks.

  zh: 1.5.1 更好的橡皮鸭
- en: We can think of generative AI as the next iteration of the rubber duck. Rubber
    duck debugging was popularized by the book *The Pragmatic Programmer* by Andy
    Hunt and Dave Thomas (Addison-Wesley, 1999), and it provides a way of encouraging
    us to voice our thought process to a less intimidating audience than our boss
    or team lead! By speaking out loud to a rubber duck (or any inanimate object),
    we are often able to identify the problem before involving anyone else. We have
    often called over a co-worker only to point at the screen showing our captive
    audience how this piece of code could not possibly fail, only to see the immediate
    problem with our solid piece of code. Having a rubber duck to “bounce” ideas off
    is an invaluable resource (and quite cost-effective). If we are shy of speaking
    out loud (even when no one is around), some tools offer the ability to type out
    our thoughts. Slack has a channel that functions as a sounding board for our thoughts.
    Entering the channel will display “You can also talk to yourself here, but please
    bear in mind you’ll have to supply both sides of the conversation.” There is also
    a rubber duck chatbot service at [https://rubberduckdebugging.com/cyberduck/](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/cyberduck/)

    AI allows our rubber duck to provide ideas and feedback instead of just a sounding

    ChatGPT. FinTech is filled with regulations that we need to be aware of, so we
    first ask it to “Please summarize the Check 21 regulation.” After reading the
    response, we find it to be a little dry as we are software developers, not business
    analysts. So, while we may need the details later on, we just want to get a general
    impression. We can try refining our prompt: “Summarize the benefits of Check 21
    for the average bank customer.” This gives us something that may be a little more
    aligned with what we wanted to understand from the beginning. We could refine
    our prompt further: “Tell me about Check 21 in a couple of sentences,” and we
    again get a suitable response. One interesting thing to ask is “If we had to describe
    Check 21 in a single word, what would it be?” The response was “Digitalization,”
    which is actually a pretty good way to describe it.'

    and we get the associated code of print (“Current Balance: $1000.00”). It is important
    to note that the updates to ChatGPT and the fact that ChatGPT is not deterministic
    may cause the responses that we receive to vary. We may find that we enter the

- en: Now, we really like the simple program we have written so far. However, when
    looking at the return value for `print_balance`, we see it is returning `None`.
    This makes sense since we are only calling a print statement within the code.
    However, to make the code even more maintainable, we can just return the formatted
    string and let the caller decide how they want to handle it. After all, this function
    should not decide how to handle the output as the caller may want to write it
    to a file or return it in an API call. We believe it is a good habit not to assume
    that the return value will always be handled the same way (in this case, printed).
    Often, we have had to rework large swaths of code because of an assumption that
    it would always be printed (in one of our cases, printed to an open network connection).
    The resulting business logic was so intertwined and the deadline so tight that
    we ended up copying the existing code and ripping out the print statements, so
    we could return what we needed. This resulted in technical debt (work that needed
    to be done in the future to address the duplicated code). Therefore, we want to
    return just the formatted string to get us into the habit of not assuming our
    function should be doing something specific with the output. So, we then tell
    ChatGPT to return a string instead of printing it, “Update the code so that `print_balance`
    will return the string and then print it.”
  id: totrans-115

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 现在，我们真的很喜欢我们迄今为止编写的简单程序。然而，当我们查看 `print_balance` 的返回值时，我们发现它返回 `None`。这很合理，因为我们只是在代码中调用了一个打印语句。然而，为了使代码更加易于维护，我们只需返回格式化的字符串，让调用者决定他们想要如何处理它。毕竟，这个函数不应该决定如何处理输出，因为调用者可能想要将其写入文件或通过
    API 调用返回。我们认为，不假设返回值总是以相同的方式处理（在这种情况下，打印）是一个好习惯。我们经常不得不重新编写大量代码，因为假设它总是会被打印出来（在我们的一个案例中，打印到一个开放的网络上）。结果，业务逻辑变得非常复杂，截止日期非常紧张，我们最终不得不复制现有的代码，移除打印语句，以便返回我们需要的。这导致了技术债务（未来需要完成的工作以解决重复的代码）。因此，我们只想返回格式化的字符串，以养成不假设我们的函数应该对输出执行特定操作的习惯。因此，我们告诉
    ChatGPT 返回一个字符串而不是打印它，“更新代码，使 `print_balance` 返回字符串并打印它。”

    keeping the length as 2\. This is incorrect. The correct condition should be “if

    but can become a bit more convoluted when trying to follow it. Second, the other
    suggestion was to update the if statement in the code to be `if` `len(user_transactions)`
    `+` `1` `>` `max_length:`. With either of these solutions in place, we can rerun
    the code or rerun the tests to confirm that the code is working better.'

    logic. If we found that puzzling, then we might ask ChatGPT about it. We followed
    up with “What if we were to change the line to `if len(user_transactions)` `>=
    max_length:`?” and ChatGPT gave us some additional information but also confirmed

    follow up with “Is there a performance benefit to one way versus the other?” and
    ChatGPT gave a reasonable answer. One thing we found interesting was that it started
    putting `if` `len(user_transactions)` `>=` `max_length:` as its suggested change
    and favored it because it was intuitive and provided better readability. Either
    way, we hope that you will also see the usefulness in being able to get some feedback

    with, it is probably a good time to go over verification. We should never have
    tools such as ChatGPT write us a bunch of code that we could never understand.
    It can be beneficial to see how things are done, and we can even use it to generate
    code for ourselves (see the following sections for some additional insights on
    security/privacy/ownership concerns). But remember that sticking that code in
    and checking it means that we will own it. There have been many times where we
    have been asked about a code change that we made a decade ago because we were
    the last person to change that module.

    Perhaps, after seeing the regular expression to validate an email, you decide
    that you may want to validate the results by doing a bit more research. By asking
    ChatGPT to provide sources for the code, it will refer you to the Perl documentation
    (`perldoc`). It will also refer to general regular expression knowledge, as well
    as the official standard for email addresses (RFC-5322). This can give us a good
    starting point when we want to learn a bit more about code we do not understand.

    take input and process it for us. For example, let us say that a banker provides
    us with a report file, and they want some reporting done with it. They provide
    us with a comma-separated value (CSV) file and want us to total it up. Why they
    cannot do that in Excel is beyond us, but we figure it may be a good chance for
    us to get some additional Python practice and maybe try generative AI. We are
    provided some data formatted as

    you’ve provided a list of Social Security Numbers (SSNs) paired with account numbers
    and corresponding balances. How can I assist you with this data?” which is a very
    nice response. Compare that response to one we may receive from your co-worker
    if you just threw a similar printout in front of them.

- en: While this is potentially a very helpful way to use generative AI, there are
    some potential drawbacks. One is that we have just entered nonpublic information
    (NPI) into ChatGPT. If the tool we are using ingests the data for training, then
    potentially, we have exposed customer information to an insecure source, as it
    may show up in responses to other users. We must be very careful about the data
    that we enter into any tool, not just when using generative AI, as we want to
    be sure that the information is stored securely. In our case, any SSN starting
    with `000` is invalid, so we are not using real data.

    License Agreement (EULA).

    owns that code? Do we have to pay royalties to them? These types of questions/concerns
    are what we should keep in mind as we make the transition of student or developing
    for personal use versus developing in a corporate environment. Corporations can
    be very prickly about releasing sensitive data and rightfully so. Their business
    may depend on trade secrets, and there could be substantial fines for mishandling

    topic throughout our careers—are the areas of privacy and security. It may be
    possible that feeding our code into a generative AI tool is helping to train it,
    and our proprietary code could end up getting output as an answer to someone else’s
    prompt. Tools such as GitHub Copilot specifically state that they do not store
    or share our code. In that same aspect, we will need to be careful about sensitive
    information such as nonpublic information (NPI) or personally identifiable information
    (PII) that we input into the model as well.

    for each business unit, so we can create a compelling infographic and think that
    generative AI could make that helpful. Well now, we have just potentially shared
    corporate/trade secrets with the model! So, some care and thought should be given
    to what we enter the system. If using generative AI to troubleshoot problems as
    we did in the previous section, it may be beneficial to create a smaller code
    snippet that is more generalized but still suffers the same problem we are troubleshooting.

    of cases, we have seen when asking tools such as ChatGPT for the latest version
    of Java or NPM, it is aware enough to qualify its response. In other cases, our
    question may indicate that it is a potential version problem. For instance, when
    asking ChatGPT “How do I connect to PostgreSQL in Python?” it provides a reasonable
    example of using `psycopg2`. However, there is a newer rewrite of `psycopg2` called
    `psycopg3`. If we try to refine our example and ask ChatGPT to use `psycopg3`
    instead of `psycopg2`, it again says that its data may be out of date:'

    we may be thrown off course a little bit but not to worry. We might think that

    we could easily ask our co-workers. However, if we are new to the job and thrown
    into the deep end of the pool, we may be reluctant to ask our new mentor (who
    is undoubtedly very busy) to clarify such a simple oversight.
