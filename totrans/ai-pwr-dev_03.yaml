- en: In part 2, we delve into the practical application of LLMs in software design
    and development. This part of the book explores how AI enhances the design phase,
    using real-world examples to illustrate its impact. It covers foundational concepts
    like domain modeling, immutability, and design patterns, demonstrating how these
    principles are applied in practice with the help of tools like GitHub Copilot.
    We also address data management challenges, showcasing how AI facilitates real-time
    asset monitoring and data analysis. By integrating AI into these stages, developers
    can streamline their workflows, improve efficiency, and foster innovation in their
    projects.
